Because of this increased risk to own-ers of protected copyrighted works and because most owners of copy-rights in non-U.S. works do not register their copyrights as a matterof course, the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) isproposing regulations that allow CBP to be more responsive toclaims of piracy.The CBP Regulations currently require that in order to be eligiblefor border protection all claims to copyright, foreign and domestic, beregistered with the U.S. Copyright Office. This document proposes toallow sound recordings and motion pictures or similar audio-visualworks to be recorded with CBP while pending registration with theU.S. Copyright Office.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION FOR CERTAIN

AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of

ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: This document adopts as a ﬁnal rule, with changes,
interim amendments to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection
(CBP) regulations pertaining to importations of merchandise bearing
suspected counterfeit trademarks or trade names that are recorded
with CBP. Speciﬁcally, the amendments allow CBP, for the purpose of
obtaining assistance in determining whether merchandise bears a
counterfeit mark, to disclose to a trademark or other mark owner
information appearing on merchandise or its retail packaging that
may otherwise be protected by the Trade Secrets Act. This ﬁnal rule
also amends the CBP regulations to further enhance information-
sharing procedures by requiring CBP to release to the importer an
unredacted sample or image of the suspect merchandise or its retail
packaging any time after presentation of the suspect goods for ex-
amination. This change is to reﬂect that an importer may not have
complete information about the marks appearing on imported goods,
and release of such unredacted information will assist the importer in
providing CBP with a meaningful response to a detention notice. The
amendments in this ﬁnal rule also require CBP to release limited
importation information to the mark owner no later than the time of
issuance of the detention notice to the importer, rather than within 30
business days from the date of detention. Finally, these amendments
require CBP to notify the mark owner that use of any information
otherwise protected by the Trade Secrets Act that is disclosed by CBP
to the mark owner is for the limited purpose of assisting CBP.

ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: This document amends Customs and Border Protection
(CBP) regulations to reﬂect the extension of import restrictions on

cultures of the Republic of Nicaragua. The restrictions, which were
originally imposed by Treasury Decision (T.D.) 00–75 and extended by
CBP Decision (CBP Dec.) 05–33 and CBP Dec. 10–32 are due to expire
on October 20, 2015. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and
Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has determined
that factors continue to warrant the imposition of import restrictions
and no cause for suspension exists. Accordingly, these import restric-
tions will remain in effect for an additional 5 years, and the CBP
regulations are being amended to reﬂect this extension until October
20, 2020. These restrictions are being extended pursuant to determi-
nations of the United States Department of State made under the
terms of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act
that implemented the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Pro-
hibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of
Ownership of Cultural Property. T.D. 00–75 contains the Designated
List of archaeological material representing Pre-Hispanic cultures of
Nicaragua to which the restrictions apply.

changes relating to the application, approval, and execution of bonds.
CBP has also determined not to proceed with proposals relating to
provisions that are the subject of other rulemakings currently under
inter-departmental review. In the notice of proposed rulemaking,
CBP used the terms “CBP-approved electronic data interchange sys-
tem” and “electronic ﬁling” to describe the manner by which continu-
ous bonds may be submitted to CBP. In this ﬁnal rule, these terms are
clariﬁed to reﬂect that continuous bonds may be scanned and sub-
mitted to CBP as an email attachment, or by facsimile. This docu-
ment also amends the CBP regulations to allow for the ﬁling of single
transaction bonds pursuant to these methods. In this rulemaking,
CBP also clariﬁes the CBP regulations to reﬂect that intellectual
property rights sample bonds are posted to protect the importer or
owner of the sample, and changes provisions of the international
carrier bond regarding the payment of fees. Lastly, this ﬁnal rule
adopts non-substantive amendments to the regulations regarding

EXTENSION OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON
CERTAIN ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ETHNOLOGICAL
MATERIALS FROM THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
AGENCY: Customs and Border Protection, Department of Home-
land Security; Department of the Treasury.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border
Protection (CBP) regulations to reﬂect the extension of import restric-
tions on certain archaeological and ethnological materials from the
Republic of Colombia (‘‘Colombia’’). The restrictions, which were
originally imposed by CBP Decision (Dec.) 06–09 and extended by
CBP Dec. 11–06, are due to expire on March 15, 2016. The Assistant
Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States De-
partment of State, has determined that factors continue to warrant
the imposition of import restrictions and no cause for suspension
exists. Accordingly, these import restrictions will remain in effect for
an additional ﬁve years, and the CBP regulations are being amended
to reﬂect this extension until March 15, 2021. These restrictions are
being extended pursuant to determinations of the United States De-
partment of State made under the terms of the Convention on Cul-
tural Property Implementation Act that implemented the United
Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing
the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural
Property. CBP Dec. 06–09 contains the Designated List of archaeo-
logical and ethnological materials of Colombia to which the restric-
tions apply.

CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION’S BOND
PROGRAM; CORRECTION
AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of
Homeland Security.
ACTION: Final rule; correction.
SUMMARY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published
in the Federal Register of November 13, 2015, a ﬁnal rule amending
CBP’s bond regulations. In that rule, CBP amended the regulation
prescribing bond and rider ﬁling requirements and stated, in the
preamble, that the agency’s intent was to provide additional time for
the ﬁling of these documents prior to their effective date. Due to a
drafting error, one of the provisions inadvertently provides for a more
restrictive time frame for ﬁling a continuous bond, associated appli-
cation, or rider prior to their effective date. This document corrects

COMMERCIAL TRUCK SINGLE-CROSSING USER FEE
AUTOMATION AND PREPAYMENT PILOT
AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection; Department of
Homeland Security.
ACTION: General notice.
SUMMARY: This document announces that U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection (CBP) intends to conduct a pilot test program pursuant
to its authority under 19 CFR 101.9(a) to allow a new payment option
for commercial truck single-crossing user fees. The CBP regulations
specify the applicable user fee for commercial trucks upon arrival into
the United States and the methods of payment, which include pay-
ment on an annual basis or on a per crossing basis. Although com-
mercial truck carriers can electronically prepay the user fees on an
annual basis, carriers who opt for the single-crossing user fee must
pay the fee upon arrival at a U.S. port of entry. This pilot will enable
the owner, agent, or person in charge of a commercial truck to prepay
the single-crossing user fee online prior to arrival at a port of entry.
This notice describes the pilot, its purpose, how it will be imple-
mented, the duration of the pilot, and invites public comment on any
aspect of the pilot. This pilot will not affect the annual commercial
truck user fee payment option.
DATES: The pilot will begin at the Buffalo, Detroit and El Paso
ports of entry starting on June 2, 2016. If it is determined that the
pilot is working successfully at these initial ports, the pilot would
be expanded to all U.S. land border ports of entry that process
commercial trucks. The exact date of the expansion to all U.S. land
border ports of entry would be announced on the CBP Web site,
http://www.cbp.gov. The pilot will run for approximately one year.
Comments concerning this notice and all aspects of the pilot may
be submitted at any time during the pilot period.

pilot should be submitted to James Pattan, Program Manager,

ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border

tions on certain archaeological and ethnological material from the
Hellenic Republic (Greece). The restrictions, which were originally
imposed by CBP Decision (CBP Dec.) 11–25, are due to expire on
November 21, 2016. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and
Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has determined
that factors continue to warrant the imposition of import restrictions
and no cause for suspension exists. Accordingly, these import restric-
tions will remain in effect for an additional ﬁve years, and the CBP
regulations are being amended to reﬂect this extension until Novem-
ber 21, 2021. These restrictions are being extended pursuant to de-
terminations of the United States Department of State made under
the terms of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation
Act that implemented the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Pro-
hibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of
Ownership of Cultural Property. CBP Dec. 11–25 contains the Desig-
nated List of archaeological and ecclesiastical ethnological material

REGULATORY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CENTERS OF
EXCELLENCE AND EXPERTISE
AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, DHS.
ACTION: Interim ﬁnal rule.
SUMMARY: In 2012, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
developed a test to incrementally transition the operational trade
functions that traditionally reside with port directors to the Centers
of Excellence and Expertise (Centers). The purpose of the test was to
broaden the ability of the Centers to make decisions by waiving
certain identiﬁed regulations to the extent necessary to provide the
Center directors, who manage the Centers, with the authority to
make the decisions normally reserved for the port directors. At this
time, CBP is prepared to end the test and establish the Centers as a
permanent organizational component of the agency and to transition
certain additional trade functions to the Centers. This rule amends
the CBP regulations on an interim basis to implement this organiza-
tional change by: Deﬁning the Centers and the Center directors;
amending the deﬁnition for port directors to distinguish their func-
tions from those of the Center directors; identifying the Center man-
agement offices; explaining the process by which importers will be
assigned to Centers; providing the importer with an appeals process
for its Center assignment; identifying the regulatory functions that
will be transitioned from the port directors to the Center directors
and those that will be jointly carried out by the port directors and the
Center directors; and providing clariﬁcation in applicable regulations
that payments and documents may continue to be submitted at the
ports of entry or electronically.

ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: This ﬁnal rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border

The restrictions, which were originally imposed by Treasury Decision

logical materials described in T.D. 97–50 is revised in this document
to reﬂect the addition of Colonial period documents and manuscripts.
Accordingly, the restrictions will remain in effect for an additional 5
years, and the CBP regulations are being amended to indicate this
fourth extension. These restrictions are being extended pursuant to
determinations of the United States Department of State made under
the terms of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation
Act, which implements the 1970 United Nations Educational, Scien-
tiﬁc and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on the Means
of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer

EXTENSION OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON
ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ETHNOLOGICAL MATERIALS
FROM THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of
Homeland Security; Department of the Treasury.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: This ﬁnal rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border
Protection (CBP) regulations to reﬂect an extension of import restric-
tions on certain archaeological materials from Mali. These restric-
tions, which were originally imposed by Treasury Decision (T.D.)
93–74, and last extended by CBP Decision (Dec.) 12–14, are due to
expire on September 19, 2017. The Acting Under Secretary for Public
Diplomacy and Public Affairs, United States Department of State,
has determined that conditions warrant the continued imposition of
import restrictions on certain archaeological materials and the addi-
tion of import restrictions on certain ethnological materials from
Mali. The Designated List of cultural property described in CBP Dec.
07–77 is revised in this document to reﬂect the addition of ethnologi-
cal materials to include manuscripts dating between the twelfth and
twentieth centuries in paper. The import restrictions imposed on the
archaeological and ethnological materials from Mali will be in effect
for a ﬁve-year period, and the CBP regulations are being amended
accordingly to reﬂect this extension through September 19, 2022.
These restrictions are being imposed pursuant to determinations of
the United States Department of State made under the terms of the
Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, which imple-
ments the 1970 United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Prohibiting
and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership
of Cultural Property.

CHANGES TO THE IN-BOND PROCESS
AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of
Homeland Security; Department of the Treasury.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: This ﬁnal rule adopts, with several changes, proposed
amendments to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regula-
tions regarding changes to the in-bond process published in the Fed-
eral Register on February 22, 2012. The in-bond process allows
imported merchandise to be entered at one U.S. port of entry without
appraisement or payment of duties and transported by a bonded
carrier to another U.S. port of entry or other authorized destination
provided all statutory and regulatory conditions are met. At the
destination port, the merchandise is entered or exported. The
changes in this rule, including the automation of the in-bond process,
will enhance CBP’s ability to regulate and track in-bond merchandise
and ensure that in-bond merchandise is properly entered or exported.
This document addresses comments received in response to the pro-
posed rule and makes several changes in response to the comments
that further simplify and facilitate the in-bond process.
DATES: This rule is effective on November 27, 2017.

ACTION: Interim ﬁnal rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: To address ongoing aviation security threats, U.S. Cus­ toms and Border Protection (CBP) is amending its regulations per­ taining to the submission of advance air cargo data to implement a mandatory Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS) program for any inbound aircraft required to make entry under the CBP regulations that will have commercial cargo aboard. The ACAS program requires the inbound carrier or other eligible party to electronically transmit speciﬁed advance cargo data (ACAS data) to CBP for air cargo trans­ ported onboard U.S.-bound aircraft as early as practicable, but no later than prior to loading of the cargo onto the aircraft. The ACAS program enhances the security of the aircraft and passengers on U.S.-bound ﬂights by enabling CBP to perform targeted risk assess­ ments on the air cargo prior to the aircraft’s departure for the United States. These risk assessments will identify and prevent high-risk air cargo from being loaded on the aircraft that could pose a risk to the aircraft during ﬂight. EFFECTIVE DATE: This interim ﬁnal rule is effective June 12, 2018. Comment date: Comments must be received by August 13, 2018. ADDRESSES: Please submit any comments, identiﬁed by docket number [USCBP–2018–0019], by one of the following methods: •	 Federal eRulemaking Portal: http://www.regulations.gov.

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY 19 CFR Part 190 RIN 1515–AE23 MODERNIZED DRAWBACK; CORRECTION AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security; Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking; correction. SUMMARY: This document corrects a proposed regulation in a no­ tice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register of August 2, 2018, regarding Modernized Drawback. Speciﬁcally, CBP inadvertently proposed in 19 CFR 190.32(d)(2) an exemption for drawback claims for wine which included an imprecise reference to the entirety of paragraph (b). The reference should have been only to paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), the speciﬁc paragraphs regarding the “lesser of” rule. As is evident from the entirety of the proposed rule, paragraph (b)(3), which implements the statutory prohibition on double drawback, applies to all drawback claims for wine. This tech­ nical correction remedies a clerical error that occurred when the language of paragraph (b)(3) was moved from a different part of the proposed regulations. DATES: August 20, 2018 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Randy Mitchell, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of Trade, Trade Policy and Programs, 202–863–6532, randy.mitchell@cbp.dhs.gov.

 SELF-ASSESSMENT PRE-CERTIFICATION TEST
 AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection; Department of Homeland Security. ACTION: General notice. SUMMARY: On April 17, 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced a test allowing customs brokers to pre-certify im­ porters for participation in the Importer Self-Assessment (ISA) pro­ gram. The Customs Broker Importer Self-Assessment Pre- Certiﬁcation (Broker ISA PC) test was intended to leverage customs brokers’ relationships with importers to facilitate and promote im­ porter participation in the ISA program. Unfortunately, there was minimal importer participation in the test; thus, CBP has determined that it is not effective to continue with the Broker ISA PC test. This notice announces CBP’s intention to discontinue the test and not to move forward with a permanent Broker ISA PC program. DATES: As of September 21, 2018, the test is discontinued.

CONFORMING AMENDMENTS RELATED TO TEMPORARYENTRY OF BUSINESS PERSONS UNDER THEAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OFAMERICA, THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES, AND CANADA(USMCA)
AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, DHS.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: This ﬁnal rule amends the Department of HomelandSecurity (DHS) regulations relating to the temporary entry of Cana-dian and Mexican citizen business persons into the United States byreplacing references to the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA) with references to the Agreement Between the UnitedStates of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA).The USMCA superseded NAFTA and its related provisions on July 1,2020. Chapter 16 of the USMCA generally maintains the same treat-ment as provided under NAFTA with respect to the temporary entryof Canadian and Mexican citizen business persons, so substantivechanges to the regulations are not needed. This document simplyupdates the relevant regulations to replace all references to NAFTA,including references to its appendices and annexes, with the corre-sponding USMCA references. This document also makes other minor,non-substantive conforming amendments and stylistic changes andcorrects typographical errors.
DATES: This ﬁnal rule is effective on July 11, 2022.
