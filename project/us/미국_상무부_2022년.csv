Third, this rule clarifies and corrects provisions of the EAR that pertain to luxury goods destined for Russia and Belarus and items for use in Russia’s oil refinery sector. Fourth, it makes a technical correction to an EAR provision describing items and activities subject to the EAR by adding a cross-reference to the Foreign Direct Product Rules of the EAR, which were updated shortly before the Russia and Belarus export controls were imposed.
