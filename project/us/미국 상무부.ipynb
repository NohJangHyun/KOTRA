As controls on exports of technology are a key component of the effort to protect sensitive U.S. technology, many sensitive technologies are listed on the CCL, often consistent with the lists maintained by the multilateral export control regimes of which the United States is a member. Certain technologies, however, may not yet be listed on the CCL or controlled multilaterally because they are emerging technologies. As such, they have not yet been evaluated for their national security impacts. This advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) seeks public comment on criteria for identifying emerging technologies that are essential to U.S. national security, for example because they have potential conventional weapons, intelligence collection, weapons of mass destruction, or terrorist applications or could provide the United States with a qualitative military or intelligence advantage. Comment on this ANPRM will help inform the interagency process to identify and describe such emerging technologies.

      "The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding twenty-one entities to the Entity List. The twenty-one entities that are added to the Entity List have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. BIS is taking this action to ensure the efficacy of existing sanctions on the Russian Federation (Russia) for violating international law and fueling the conflict in eastern Ukraine. These entities will be listed on the Entity List under the destinations of the Crimea region of Ukraine and Russia..\n",

Comments must be received by BIS no later than April 13, 2018.\n",

      "This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding twenty-one persons under twenty-three entries to the Entity List. The twenty-one persons who are added to the Entity List have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. These twenty-one persons will be listed on the Entity List under the destinations of Bulgaria, China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.). In addition, this rule amends the EAR by removing three entities from the Entity List. This rule removes one entity listed under the destination of Taiwan and two entities listed under the destination of the U.A.E. from the Entity List. All three of the removals are the results of requests for removal received by BIS pursuant to the section of the EAR used for requesting removal or modification of an Entity List entry and a review of information provided in the removal requests. Finally, this final rule modifies two existing entries on the Entity List. This rule modifies one entry under China and one entry under Pakistan to provide additional or modified addresses and/or names for these persons.\n",
