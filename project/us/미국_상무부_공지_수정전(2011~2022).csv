(Huawei) and 114 of its foreign affiliates were added to the Entity List by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in 2019, but continue to participate in many important international standards organizations in which U.S. companies also participate. As international standards serve as the building blocks for product development and help ensure functionality, interoperability, and safety of the products, it is important to U.S. technological leadership that U.S. companies be able to work in these bodies in order to ensure that U.S. standards proposals are fully considered. Since Huawei’s addition to the Entity List, organizations have consequently sought clarity about U.S. industry participation in standards development. BIS is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to authorize the release of certain technology to Huawei and its affiliates on the Entity List without a license if such release is made for the purpose of contributing to the revision or development of a ‘‘standard’’ in a ‘‘standards organization.’’ For the purpose of this interim final rule, a ‘‘standard’’ is as defined in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A?119: Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities, and a ‘‘standards organization,’’ is the equivalent of a ‘‘voluntary consensus standards body’’ as defined in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A?119: Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities.

It also would revise certain Export Administration Regulations license exceptions to more closely align them with exemptions in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. This proposed rule also would eliminate the $2,500 threshold under which certain license exception transaction need not be reported in the Automated Export System for items currently on the Commerce Control List as well as items that would be added to the Commerce Control List as part of the President’s export control initiative.? The comment period for this proposed rule closes August 6, 2012."
06/19/2012,Feasibility of Enumerating “Specially Designed” Components,,"As part of the President’s Export Control Reform (ECR) Initiative, this Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) requests comments on the feasibility of positively identifying “specially designed” “components” on the Commerce Control List (CCL) so as to decrease the use of the term, which appears extensively throughout the CCL, and thereby facilitate enhanced public compliance with the Export Administration Regulations.? Specifically, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is evaluating whether it is feasible to create exhaustive lists of the “specially designed” “components” referred to in certain Export Control Classification Numbers on the CCL that currently use “specially designed” catch-all paragraphs, and seeks public input to assist in this evaluation.? If BIS ultimately determines that such lists might be beneficial, it intends to submit these findings to the appropriate multilateral export control regimes in the normal course of list proposal changes. The request for comments in this ANPR is part of Commerce’s retrospective plan under EO 13563 completed in August 2011"
06/19/2012,“Specially Designed” Definition,,"As part of the President’s Export Control Reform (ECR) Initiative, this proposed rule, and a separate proposed rule from the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, being published in conjunction with this document, sets forth, as much as possible, a common definition of the term “specially designed” for use in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The term “specially designed” is used widely in the Commerce Control List (CCL) and would play an important role in the “600 series” that the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has? proposed to create to control less sensitive defense articles transferred from the United States Munitions List (USML) to the Commerce Control List (CCL). The revisions in this rule are part of Commerce’s retrospective plan under EO 13563 completed in August 2011."

In conjunction with establishing these new ECCNs, this proposed rule would control military helmets (currently controlled under ECCNs 0A018 and 0A988) under new ECCN 1A613 and amend ECCN 1A005 for body armor.? This proposed rule also would remove machetes from ECCN 0A988.

This rule proposes also to integrate into those five new ECCNs items within the scope of Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (WAML) Category 17 that would be removed from the USML, or that are not specifically identified on the USML or CCL but that are currently subject to USML jurisdiction. Finally, this rule proposes to control some items now classified under ECCNs 0A018, 0A918 and 0E018 under new ECCNs 0A617 and 0E617.

In this final rule, BIS aligns license requirements and licensing policy uner the EAR for Liechtenstein with those for Switzerland.

By virtue of a Customs Union Treaty with Switzerland, Liechtenstein has adopted the export controls implemented under Swiss law, including controls equivalent to those prescribed under multilateral regimes, and has authorized Switzerland to administer and enforce export controls within Liechtenstein뭩 territory. As a result of this arrangement, Liechtenstein and Switzerland serve as one territory for customs and export purposes. Having recently been made aware of the full scope of this arrangement and its consequences on export controls, BIS has determined that it is appropriate to codify the treatment of Liechtenstein and Switzerland as one territory for purposes of the EAR. This treatment of Liechtenstein is consistent with the effort of the United States to streamline licensing requirements where export controls prescribed by the multilateral regimes are implemented.

07/15/2011,Proposed Revisions to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR): Control of Items the President Determines No Longer Warrant Control under the United States Munitions List (USML),,"This Export Control Reform (ECR) initiative rule proposes a new regulatory construct for the transfer of items on the USML that, in accordance with section 38(f) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA)(22 U.S.C. 2778(f)(1)), the President determines no longer warrant control under the AECA and that would be controlled under the EAR once the congressional notification requirements of section 38(f) and corresponding amendments to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120-130) and its USML and the EAR and its CCL are completed. In addition to proposing a regulatory construct for transferring these items into the CCL, this rule proposes the transfer of an initial tranche of items from USML Category VII (Tanks and Military Vehicles) to the CCL. This rule also proposes amending the EAR to establish a process by which certain items moving from the USML to the CCL would be made eligible for License Exception Strategic Trade Authorization (STA), and proposes EAR amendments related to movement of USML items to the CCL, such as new definitions of relevant terms, including 뱒pecially designed,?밻nd items,?뱎arts,?and 밹omponents.?Finally, this notice proposes establishing a new holding Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) in which items that warrant a significant level of control, but are not otherwise classified on the CCL, may be temporarily placed. Comments on this proposed rule must be received by BIS no later than September 13, 2011."
07/13/2011,Addition of the New State of the Republic of South Sudan to the Export Administration Regulations,,"In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to add controls on exports and reexports of U.S.-origin dual-use items to a new nation, the Republic of South Sudan. In January 2011, a referendum was held in the region of Southern Sudan to determine whether that region would remain part of Sudan or become a separate, independent nation. On February 7, 2011, the referendum commission announced that the region of Southern Sudan had voted to become a separate nation, effective July 9, 2011. On February 7, 2011, recognizing this historic milestone in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), President Obama announced the intention of the United States to formally recognize the Republic of South Sudan as a sovereign state in July, 2011. BIS is therefore amending the EAR to reflect the July 9, 2011 formal recognition by adding the new nation, the Republic of South Sudan, to the Commerce Country Chart and including it in Country Group B, which will render the destination eligible for certain export and reexport License Exceptions. The controls that continue to apply to 밪udan?under the EAR will not apply to the Republic of South Sudan."

This change is being made pursuant to a determination by BIS that, because there are no regulatory restrictions on making such software “publicly available,” and because, once it is “publicly available,” by definition it is available for download by any end user without restriction, removing it from the jurisdiction of the EAR will have no effect on export control policy. This action will not result in the decontrol of source code classified under ECCN 5D002, but it will result in a simplification of the regulatory provisions for publicly available mass market software and specified encryption software in object code."
