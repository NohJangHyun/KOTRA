No. 2022/35 
Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent 
goods on 1 August 2022 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, beers 
and fuel products, operative from 1 August 2022.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  

The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is calculated 
by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June or 
December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. The December 2021 Quarter CPI 
figure (121.3) will be used to determine the indexation factor for the duty rate increase applied on 
1 August 2022, as it is higher than the previously used June 2021 Quarter CPI figure (refer to ACN 2022/05).  

On 27 July 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June 2022 Quarter CPI  
figure (126.1). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for August 2022 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 

June Quarter 2022 

December Quarter 2021 

Indexation Factor 

126.1 

121.3 

1.040 

As the indexation factor for August 2022 (1.040) is greater than one, customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff, will increase by the application of this factor.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 1 August 2022, are set out in Table 1 
below and supersede the rates outlined in Australian Customs Notice 2022/05. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:  

?? Schedule 4A (Singaporean originating goods)  
?? Schedule 5 (US originating goods)  
?? Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods) 
?? Schedule 6A (Peruvian originating goods)  
?? Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods)

Cargo reporting requirements for international mail 
and certain internal business documents 

This notice replaces ACN 2002/69 on cargo reporting requirements for international and airline mail.  

The Australian Border Force (ABF) has conducted a review of arrangements for the cargo reporting of: 

??

??

international mail consigned to Australia, by, or on behalf of, Australia Post, and 

internal business documents carried by airlines and shipping lines. 

This notice outlines cargo reporting obligations for all cargo reporters of international mail and internal business 
documents,  and  administrative  arrangements  to  support  compliance  with  requirements  under  the  
Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act).   

Cargo reporting requirements for international mail 
Section 64AB of the Customs Act states that, if a ship or aircraft is due to arrive at its first port or airport in 
Australia since it last departed from a port or airport outside Australia, each cargo reporter1 must report to the 
ABF particulars of all goods: 

a) 

that the cargo reporter has arranged to be carried on the ship or aircraft on the voyage or flight; 

b) 

that are intended to be unloaded from the ship or aircraft at a port or airport in Australia (whether the 
first port or airport, or any subsequent port or airport on the same voyage or flight); and 

c) 

that are not: 

i) 
ii) 

accompanied personal or household effects or a passenger or member of the crew; or 
ship?셲 stores or aircraft?셲 stores 

Cargo reporter, in relation to a ship or aircraft and in relation to a particular voyage or flight, means: 

a 
b 
c 

 the operator or charterer of the ship or aircraft; or 
 a slot charterer in respect of the ship; or 
 a freight forwarder in respect of the ship or aircraft; 

for the voyage or flight (reference s.4 of the Customs Act).

2022/29 

New timeframes for the disposal of unentered and 
abandoned goods 

From 1 July 2022, a shorter holding period will apply to the disposal of imported goods that have not been 
claimed by the importer.  

From this date, operators holding unentered or abandoned goods may dispose of the goods, subject to 
permission from the Australian Border Force (ABF), after the following time periods have passed: 

?? unentered goods (i.e. goods that have not been entered for home consumption or warehousing) ??

two calendar months from the second working day after importation,  

?? abandoned goods (i.e. goods that may have been abandoned by their owner and are not required, or 
unable to be, entered for home consumption) ??two calendar months from when the goods are found 
at a customs place.  

o 

If it is clear that the goods have been abandoned, the ABF may approve the disposal of 
abandoned goods within the two calendar month period.   

o  Evidence may be required to confirm when the goods became abandoned.   

The ABF has introduced the new two-month timeframe in response to industry feedback, in consultation with 
the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The reform provides a simpler and streamlined 
timeframe for unentered and abandoned goods, and reduces the period that these goods must be held from 
the previous 90-days (abandoned goods) and six-month (unentered goods) periods. 

For depot operators, the reduction in the timeframe will mean that almost all unclaimed imported goods can 
be disposed of without first having to remove the goods to a warehouse under section 77P of the  
Customs Act 1901.  

Consistent with existing arrangements, once the two-month period has passed, industry operators may be 
able to donate suitable goods to charity, sell the goods to recover their costs, or destroy, recycle or re-export 
the goods.

No. 2022/27 
Commencement of phase 2 of the Recycling and 
Waste Reduction (Export?밯aste Plastics) Rules 2021

With effect from 1 July 2022, Australia will further restrict exports of waste plastic under the Recycling and 
Waste Reduction Act 2020 (the Act) and the Recycling and Waste Reduction (Export-Waste Plastics) Rules 
2021 (the Plastic Rules).

Phase two of the Plastic Rules will only allow the export of waste plastics that have been sorted into a single 
resin or polymer type and capable of re-manufacture without further processing; or is processed with other 
materials into processed engineered fuel. Exporters will not be issued a waste export licence to export 
unprocessed, baled waste plastic as they will not meet the requirements of the Plastics Rules from 
1 July 2022. 

Exporters will be required to hold a waste export licence for plastic and declare each export consignment of 
waste plastic to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. 

The intent of the measure is to prevent the export of unprocessed waste plastic, which is likely to have a 
negative impact on human health and the environment in the receiving country. It will also maximise the 
ability of the Australian waste and recycling sector to collect, recover, recycle, reuse and convert waste 
plastic into new products. 

The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water administers licences to export 
waste plastic, which can be valid for up to three years. Waste export licences are subject to conditions. 
Exporters need to meet the requirements of the Act and the Plastic Rules in order for the Minister for the 
Environment and Water to consider granting a waste export licence. 

For further information on the new export regulation of waste products, please visit the Department of 
Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water website or send your queries to 
exportwaste@environment.gov.au.
