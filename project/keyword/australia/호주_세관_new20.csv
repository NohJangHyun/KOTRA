2022-07-01,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2022-30.pdf,"Cargo reporting requirements for international mail 
and certain internal business documents"," australian notice (acn) 2022/30 cargo reporting requirements for international mail and certain internal business documents this notice replaces acn 2002/69 on cargo reporting requirements for international and airline mail. the australian border force (abf) has conducted a review of arrangements for the cargo reporting of:   international mail consigned to australia, by, or on behalf of, australia post, and internal business documents carried by airlines and shipping lines. this notice outlines cargo reporting obligations for all cargo reporters of international mail and internal business documents, and administrative arrangements to support compliance with requirements under the act 1901 (customs act). cargo reporting requirements for international mail section 64ab of the act states that, if a ship or aircraft is due to arrive at its first port or airport in australia since it last departed from a port or airport outside australia, each cargo reporter1 must report to the abf particulars of all goods: a) that the cargo reporter has arranged to be carried on the ship or aircraft on the voyage or flight; b) that are intended to be unloaded from the ship or aircraft at a port or airport in australia (whether the first port or airport, or any subsequent port or airport on the same voyage or flight); and c) that are not: i) ii) accompanied personal or household effects or a passenger or member of the crew; or ship’s stores or aircraft’s stores cargo reporter, in relation to a ship or aircraft and in relation to a particular voyage or flight, means: a b c the operator or charterer of the ship or aircraft; or a slot charterer in respect of the ship; or a freight forwarder in respect of the ship or aircraft; for the voyage or flight (reference s.4 of the act). australia’s service 1 section 63a defines cargo to include mail carried on the ship or aircraft. the act defines mail as: mail: in relation to a ship or aircraft means: any goods consigned through the post office that are carried on the ship or aircraft and any other correspondence carried on the ship or aircraft that is not consigned as cargo and that is not accompanied personal or household effects of a passenger or member of the crew. if applied strictly, the definition of consignment for the purposes of section 68 of the act (acn 2021/01 refers) would require each individual mail item to be cargo-reported against a house air waybill (hawb) or house bill of lading. the abf recognises that many overseas postal administrations do not record item-level details of every mail article within a mail bag, making it challenging for mail carriers or their cargo reporter to report this information, in line with cargo reporting requirements. the abf will consider mail that is consigned through australia post, or through a third party operator for australia post, to meet requirements under section 64ab of the act when reported in the following manner: 1. for the purposes of section 68 of the act, the abf will consider a ‘consignment of mail’ as one or more containers, pallets or loose-bags of mail, that is consigned by a single overseas postal operator to a single entity or mail gateway in australia, and that generally arrives on one vessel or aircraft. a. it is acceptable for international mail from various branches of one overseas mail administration being consigned to a single consignee at a single australian port of destination, to be consolidated into a single consignment under one ocean or master bill-level cargo report. b. the cargo report may relate to a single mail bag or container, or a group of mail bags or containers, that make up a single consignment. c. hubbed mail – defined as mail arriving in australia, from different international postal administrations and consigned to a single consignee at a single port of destination in australia – will also be considered a single ‘consignment of mail’. 2. where two or more consignments of mail are carried from more than one consignor, or to more than one consignee postal administration or port of destination, an equivalent number of master or ocean bill level reports are required. 3. each consignment of mail must be cargo reported at the master or ocean bill level to ensure appropriate acquittal between master/ocean bills and the corresponding impending arrival report. a. individual packets, parcels or express mail service (ems) items that are also included in the consignment may be reported as house bills under the master or ocean level bill if cargo reporter system capacities allow. b. consignments of mail must not be reported at the house bill level. c. a master or ocean-level bill should not be used to cargo report mixed consignments. mixed consignments are consignments of mail and non-mail air cargo under different house-level bills, which usually require deconsolidation at section 77g depots that are not an international mail gateway. 4. when making the cargo report, section 64ab provides that, to the extent that a cargo report relates to mail that is to be unloaded from an aircraft, the report must be made electronically and contain information that is required in the relevant approved statement. the abf will allow cargo reporters to satisfy this requirement for international mail by reporting the information contained in attachment a to the abf through the integrated cargo system (ics). cargo reporters that report international mail in this manner do not need to cargo report at the individual mail- item level. international mail that is not reported in line with this notice must cargo report individual mail items, in line with the definition of consignment under acn 2021/01. in this case, cargo reporters of mail will be required to provide house air waybill or house bill of lading-level details for each unique consignment, defined as a australia’s service 2 single arranged shipment from a consignor to a consignee. for international mail, this will require item-level cargo reporting. responsibilities of receiving cargo terminal operators (cto) imported cargo discharged from an aircraft must be moved directly from the aircraft to the cto’s premises. section 64abaa requires the responsible cto to acquit the report for overs and unders based on an accounting of the cargo once discharged. the abf will not require cto to account for the number of bags in an airline container, unless the mawb report details that information. however, where international mail must be accounted for at the bag or container level (e.g. for contractual reasons) ctos must ensure that subsequent underbond movements are linked to the original mawb report details at the bag or container level. discrepancies should be communicated to the abf by amending the landed packages field in ics or providing an additional mawb or obl report. the airline operator (or their contracted cto) is responsible for the reporting, movement and accounting of mail prior to mail being delivered to the international mail centre.  the air cto is responsible for raising the underbond movement request. for sea mail operators unloading international mail, the underbond movement request is raised by australia post rather than the cto.  if the cargo is moved under a permission given under section 71e of the act, to the international mail gateway facility (imgf), the underbond movement request should reflect the information on the cargo report.  australia post is responsible for the movement and accountability of uncleared international mail from the cto premises to the imgf (with the exception of underbond movement requests). once the mail has been received, australia post is required to provide an outturn report to to report the relocation of the mail as a result of the underbond (section 64abaa(4) refers). alternatively, if the mail is reported as 1 (one) piece and is unpacked at the imgf, australia post must provide the abf an outturn report to report the unpack (section 64abab(4)(ii) refers). internal airline or shipping line mail all internal business mail items carried by the airline or shipping line for delivery to their own company offices in australia, and that may not be consigned as cargo, must also be cargo reported under section 64ab of the act. this kind of mail is sometimes referred to as ‘on company service’ or ‘ocs’. the cargo reporting arrangements for international mail detailed at attachment a may be applied to inter-office correspondence carried by the airline (specifically, the ‘administering carrier’ in a code-share arrangement) or a shipping line or slot charterer for delivery to their own offices. cargo reporters for all other businesses or industries must meet standard cargo reporting requirements for internal office correspondence. the abf will consider internal business mail to meet cargo reporting requirements under the act, where the internal business mail is reported on the same basis as international mail under this notice, subject to the following: 1. the definition of a “consignment” of “internal business mail”, is the same that applies to a ‘consignment of mail’. a ‘consignment of internal business mail’ is defined as a container, pallet or loose-bag of mail consigned by the airline or shipping line for one of its offices in australia. 2. the contents of the consignment should be limited to inter-office correspondence. packages with non- document and non-correspondence contents including promotional materials, stores, parts or equipment, must not be consigned by internal business mail. instead, these items must be appropriately cargo reported and entered for home consumption, with taxes and charges paid (if applicable). similar to the cargo reporting process for international mail, internal business mail must also be reported at the container level on the master or ocean-bill level. 3. following the discharge of the internal business mail from the aircraft or vessel, receiving ctos must account for the consignments as per the above process for international mail. australia’s service 3 other paper items other paper items with writing or interpretable markings (including images) on them, that are carried by an airline or shipping line and are not the personal property of a crew member, must be cargo reported and declared using a self-assessed clearance declaration or an import declaration. due to legislative amendments in 2005, the ‘reportable documents indicator’ field (acr 40, scr 41) must not be used to report other paper items. latha reardon acting assistant secretary"

abandoned goods"," australian notice (acn) 2022/29 new timeframes for the disposal of unentered and abandoned goods from 1 july 2022, a shorter holding period will apply to the disposal of imported goods that have not been claimed by the importer. from this date, operators holding unentered or abandoned goods may dispose of the goods, subject to permission from the australian border force (abf), after the following time periods have passed:  unentered goods (i.e. goods that have not been entered for home consumption or warehousing) – two calendar months from the second working day after importation,  abandoned goods (i.e. goods that may have been abandoned by their owner and are not required, or unable to be, entered for home consumption) – two calendar months from when the goods are found at a place. o if it is clear that the goods have been abandoned, the abf may approve the disposal of abandoned goods within the two calendar month period. o evidence may be required to confirm when the goods became abandoned. the abf has introduced the new two-month timeframe in response to industry feedback, in consultation with the department of agriculture, fisheries and forestry. the reform provides a simpler and streamlined timeframe for unentered and abandoned goods, and reduces the period that these goods must be held from the previous 90-days (abandoned goods) and six-month (unentered goods) periods. for depot operators, the reduction in the timeframe will mean that almost all unclaimed imported goods can be disposed of without first having to remove the goods to a warehouse under section 77p of the act 1901. consistent with existing arrangements, once the two-month period has passed, industry operators may be able to donate suitable goods to charity, sell the goods to recover their costs, or destroy, recycle or re-export the goods. further information on unentered and abandoned goods can be found at abf.gov.au/importing-exporting-and- manufacturing/importing/how-to-import/disposing-unentered-abandoned-goods. latha reardon acting assistant secretary"

russian and belarusian goods from 25 april 2022, australia will join like-minded countries in removing the most favoured nation (mfn) treatment previously accorded to goods imported from the russian federation (russia), by imposing an additional duty of 35% on goods that are the produce or manufacture of russia and belarus. this increase in duty is in line with the increases imposed by the united kingdom and canada. this temporary measure is a response to russia’s illegal invasion of ukraine, supported by belarus, and is necessary for the protection of australia’s essential security interests. russia’s actions, supported by belarus, are a gross violation of international law, including the charter of the united nations. they violate ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and undermine the rules-based international order. australia is committed to upholding these principles, which are essential to international, regional and domestic stability and security. goods to which new rates of duty apply goods that are the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus and left for direct shipment to australia from a place of manufacture or warehouse in a country from which the goods were exported between 25 april 2022 and 24 october 2022 and are entered for home consumption in australia within this period are no longer eligible for the general rate of duty in schedule 3 of the tariff act 1995 (customs tariff act). this measure will commence through notice of intention to propose tariff alterations (no. 4) 2022. in accordance with proposed section 18a, goods are the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus if:   the goods are unmanufactured raw products of russia or belarus within the meaning of the act 1901; or the last process in the manufacture of the goods was performed in russia or belarus. goods will continue to be the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus if the goods are exported to another country and undergo the following, or similar, processes: changing of packaging or the breaking up or assembly of packages  operations to preserve goods in good condition for the purposes of transport or storage   disassembly of goods  placing goods in bottles, cases or boxes, fixing on cars or other simple packaging operations  affixing of marks, labels or other similar distinguishing signs on goods or their packaging  simple processes of sifting, screening, sorting or classifying or other similar simple processes please note, the above list is not an exhaustive list of the processes that will be disregarded for the purposes of determining if goods are the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus. australia’s service the new rates of duty that apply the new rates of duty for these goods are 35% of the value of the goods, as determined in accordance with section 159 of the act 1901, plus the general rate of duty, excise- equivalent duty and duty in dollar amount in schedule 3 of the tariff act. tariff classification goods general rate of duty rate of duty for goods that are the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus example 1: 3102.10.00 ammonium nitrate, whether or not in aqueous solution free 35% example 2

$0.45/kg tss 40%, or, if lower, 35% and $0.45/kg tss goods that are the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus are not eligible for a concessional rate of duty, nor are they eligible for the gst exemptions provided for by schedule 4 concessional items. schedule 4 concessional items and by-laws should not be claimed for these goods. tariff concession orders (tcos) are also unable to be claimed for use with these goods. the additional duty will not apply to goods that are originating under a free trade agreement between australia and another country. the new duty rates will be payable in addition to any interim dumping duty or interim countervailing duty that applies to goods that are the produce of manufacture of russia or belarus. accessing the correct duty rate in the integrated cargo system where goods are the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus, this must be declared. where these goods have not been correctly declared, the goods will be made subject to red line processing. this may result in delays in the release of goods from control. to declare these goods, the following details must be recorded on the import declaration (nature 10, nature 30 or nature 10/20): 1. 2. 3. 4. in the origin country code field enter either the two-digit united nations country code ru for goods made or produced in russia or by if the goods were made or produced in belarus. in the preference origin country code field enter the country code ru for goods made or produced in russia or by for goods made or produced in belarus. in the preference scheme type field, click on the drop down button and select adc (additional duty countries). in the preference rule type field click on the drop down button and select one of the following options representing the preferential rule of origin that the goods meet:  urp (unmanufactured raw products)  lpm (last process of manufacture) | 2 neither a short format self assessed clearance declaration nor a cargo report self assessed clearance declaration should be completed for goods that are the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus. where these goods have a value of $1000 aud or less, a full declaration format self assessed clearance should be completed. the correct origin country code, preference origin country code, preference scheme type and preference rule type must be recorded on this declaration. schedule 4 concessional items, such as item 26 (goods of insubstantial value) and by-law no. 1305011 cannot be claimed for the goods that are the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus that are of a value of $1000 aud or less. duty and gst will therefore be payable on these goods. warehoused goods the 35% additional duty on goods that are the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus is payable when goods are entered for home consumption, not when goods are entered for warehousing. for goods that are entered for warehousing, the additional duty is payable if these goods are entered for home consumption between 25 april 2022 and 24 october 2022 (inclusive) and had also left from a place of manufacture or warehouse in the country from which the goods were exported, for direct shipment to australia, within this period. in-transit goods and goods on the water goods are for direct shipment to australia if they do not enter the commerce of another country prior to entry for home consumption in australia. therefore, where goods that are the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus have left from a place of manufacture or warehouse in a country from where the goods are exported before 25 april 2022 and have not been imported into another country prior to being entered for home consumption or warehousing in australia, the additional duty rate of 35% will not be payable if these goods are entered for home consumption between 25 april 2022 and 24 october 2022. where goods that are the produce or manufacture of russia or belarus are on a ship arriving in australia and are kept on the ship for import in a place outside of australia, the additional rate of duty is payable if the goods are then entered for home consumption in australia between 25 april 2022 and 24 october 2022 and within this period the goods also left for direct shipment to australia from a place of manufacture or warehouse from the country of export. refund provisions for goods seized under the autonomous sanctions regime where duty has been paid for goods from 25 april 2022 and these goods have been subsequently seized under the autonomous sanctions regime, importers may be eligible for a refund of duty and indirect taxes paid. further information regarding refund eligibility is available on the australian border force website at https://www.abf.gov.au/importing-exporting-and-manufacturing/importing/refund-of-customs-duty. tariff working pages and the online tariff the following text will be added to the footnote section of all chapters. ‘from 25 april 2022 the amount of duty applied to additional duty goods, in accordance with proposed section 18a of the tariff act 1995, is equal to the general rate of duty plus an amount equal to 35% of the value of the goods’ the online tariff will be updated to reflect the new footnote shortly. no tariff working pages will be issued in relation to these changes due to the comprehensive nature of the changes. | 3 any queries related to this issue can be directed to tradepolicy1@abf.gov.au"
