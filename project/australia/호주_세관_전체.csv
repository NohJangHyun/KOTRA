TRADE MARKS ACT 1995

This Customs notice is a guide, for owners and authorised users of trade marks registered in Australia, to the
operation of the Customs seizure provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 which came into effect on 1 January
1996. The Trade Marks Act 1955 was repealed on that date.

The new legislation contains changes which have been made to reflect international trends towards greater
uniformity in the field of trade mark law. In particular, the Act conforms with the standards and principles
prescribed for trade marks in the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization.

The new Act has also simplified the language as much as possible to make it easier for readers to understand the
law: a number of terms used in the old legislation have been replaced by simpler ones, eg ""owner"" has been used
in place of ""proprietor"" of a trade mark. However, no difference in meaning is intended where simpler terms have
been used.

This notice gives a brief outline of the requirements for seeking action by the Australian Customs Service
(Customs) under section 132 of the Trade Marks Act 1995, and highlights some of the changes made to the
existing conditions and provisions. Because of the complex nature of section 132 and the obligations it places on
the Objector, it is recommended that persons considering the lodgement of a Notice of Objection discuss the
matter with their legal advisers before proceeding with the Notice.

1. Outline

Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 establishes a legislative scheme whereby the registered owner, or in
certain circumstances an authorised user, of a trade mark, may object to the importation of goods bearing a trade
mark substantially identical with or deceptively similar to that trade mark. Section 133 empowers Customs to
seize such goods pending resolution of an action brought by the Objector as to whether the importation of the
goods infringes a notified trade mark.

2. The Legislative Scheme - Seizure Provisions

Section 133 provides that where:

(a) goods manufactured outside Australia have been imported into Australia and are subject to the control of
Customs;

(b) a Notice in writing objecting to the importation of goods infringing a trade mark registered in respect of the
goods imported has been given to Customs;

(c) the goods imported are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered in Australia; and

(d) the goods, in the opinion of Customs, have applied to them a trade mark that is substantially identical with, or
deceptively similar to the notified trade mark; THEN

CUSTOMS IS REQUIRED TO SEIZE IMPORTED GOODS INFRINGING A NOTIFIED TRADE MARK UNLESS:

(e) the Comptroller is satisfied that there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the importation of the
goods constitutes an infringement of the notified trade mark; or

(f) the Comptroller is of the view that the Objector has not provided sufficient security to reimburse the
Commonwealth in respect of expenses that may be incurred by the Commonwealth in relation to the seizure of
the goods.

The legislative scheme does not provide for seizure of goods which are imported for the personal use of
the importer and are not intended to be dealt with or provided in the course of trade.

The scheme does not empower Customs to take ex officio seizure action (ie action on its own behalf).

It is important to note that the seizure powers are drawn directly from the Trade Marks Act 1995 S133 (2). The
authority to seize is separate from and should not be confused with the more general seizure provisions (relating
to Customs search and seizure) contained in the Customs, Excise and Bounty Legislation Amendment Act 1995.

AMENDMENTS TO THE CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED IMPORTS)

REGULATIONS - WOOLPACKS &amp; WOOLPACK CAPS

The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations have been amended to reflect the transfer of responsibility for the
management of woolpack quality assurance issues to the Australian Wool Exchange Ltd (AWEX). Statutory Rule
No 412 of 1995 which was gazetted in Gazette No S488 of 19 December 1995 amends the Regulations with
effect from 1 January 1996.

Regulation 4K of the Regulations prohibits the importation into Australia of woolpacks and woolpack caps unless
the permission in writing to import the goods has been granted by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy
or an authorised person (subregulation 4K(1)) or unless a certificate in respect of those goods issued under
subregulations 4K(3) to 4K(7) is produced. Certificates under subregulations 4K(3) and 4K(7) refer to certain
standards published by the Australian Wool Corporation or the Australian Wool Research and Promotion
Organisation.

The amendments to the Regulations reflect the transfer of responsibility for the standards published by the
Australian Wool Corporation or the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation to AWEX. They also
provide for importations of woolpacks or woolpack caps where a certificate has been issued which refers to a
standard of AWEX. A transitional provision has also been inserted to allow the importation of such goods until 31
March 1996 where the goods conform to a previous standard published by the Australian Wool Research and
Promotion Organisation. It is considered that this will provide a suitable time to allow importers to have new
certificates issued in respect of the relevant woolpacks.

CUSTOMS TARIFF ACT 1995

Further to ACN 95/48, the Customs Tariff Bill 1995 was tabled in the House of Representatives on 28 September
1995 and was passed by that House on 19 October 1995 and later by the Senate on 27 November 1995. The Bill
received Royal Assent on 16 December 1995. The Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Act 147 of 1995) will come into force
from 1 July 1996. The current Customs Tariff is repealed from that date.

The main purpose of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 is to put in place a new Customs Tariff (CT96) and to
incorporate approximately three hundred and fifty changes proposed by the World Customs Organization (WCO)
(formerly the Customs Co-operation Council) to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity
Description and Coding System (HCDCS). The HCDCS is the international tariff standard to which Australia has
been a signatory since 1987. Each four years the WCO agrees to changes to the HCDCS which reflect changing
patterns in international trade. The aim of the current round of changes is to regroup like products in the same
subheadings, to correct anomalies which have become apparent in the Harmonized System and to reflect
technological developments.

In incorporating these changes into the Tariff, the Government decided to maintain the rates of duty which had
already been legislated to come into force on 1 July 1996. To achieve this, some two hundred national tariff splits
have been created in addition to the changes recommended by the WCO. Extensive negotiations between
industry representatives and officers of the Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST) and the
Australian Customs Service (ACS) have been undertaken to resolve contentious matters raised by the World
Customs Organisation (WCO) changes in an attempt to maintain current rates of duty. In only five cases has it not
been possible to maintain the rate of duty. Generally this was because the goods which are moving between tariff
subheadings cannot be identified to enable new tariff splits to be made. The five commodities are:-

Foodstuffs containing cocoa of headings 1901 and 1904 will now be assessed on a totally defatted basis
rather than on a basis of cocoa powder as at present. As a consequence of this change, certain foodstuffs
containing cocoa of 1901 and 1904 will transfer to subheading 1806.90.00. The Government has decided to
retain that subheading and its rate of duty for the food preparations containing cocoa transferring from Chapter
19;
Tyre cord fabrics of woven glass fibres (7019.20.10 - DCS:4%) and other woven fibres of glass (7019.20.90 -
DCS:5%) will be combined in 7019.5. The Government has agreed to impose a DCS rate of 5%;

Graded pearls (7116) are sold, according to accepted international practice, as temporarily strung for transport
purposes and are dutiable at 5%. Heading 7101 (Free) has been reworded to delete the word ""ungraded"" from
the description of the goods. The effect of this change will be for pearls ""temporarily strung for transport"" to
transfer from 7116 to 7101. The Government has decided to retain the Free rate of duty for pearls classified in
7101 under the new tariff regime;
Input or output devices for computers, for example printers, keyboards, X-Y co-ordinate input devices, which
satisfy the conditions set out in the revised Notes 5(B) and 5(D) to Chapter 84 will be classified in subheading
8471.60.00 and be free of duty. The WCO advise that certain unidentified goods will transfer from subheading
8424.89.90 (Gen:5%) to the new classification. The rate of duty for 8471.60.00 (Free) reflects the rate
applicable to 98% of the current total trade of the subject goods; and
All waste and scrap of batteries will be classified under 8548.10.10 and will be free of duty. Currently these
goods are classified under a number of subheadings according to their constituent material.

In addition, snowboard boots will be included in the definition of sports footwear in Chapter 64 and specified in
subheadings of that Chapter. The ACS, in consultation with the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development
Authority, DIST and industry representatives, has defined snowboard boots in a new Tariff Precedent
11751000. These changes should not affect the classification or duty rates of any footwear.

Following the implementation of CT96, administrative arrangements will be put in place within DIST/ACS whereby
aggrieved parties may raise their concerns if anomalous situations have arisen in the context of the Government's
decision to preserve the duty arrangements. The appeals period will extend until one year after the
commencement of the new Act - to 30 June 1997. In the first instance, submissions for the review of the new
structure and the rates of duty should be sent to the Director, Tariff Classification, Australian Customs Service,
Customs House, 5 Constitution Avenue, Canberra ACT 2601. DIST will be consulted on policy aspects.

The Customs Tariff Act 1995 will become available from Australian Government Bookshops early in 1996. Its cost
is expected to be about $45.00. Parliamentary documentation associated with the tabling of the Bill, namely the

ORIGIN OF GOODS PACKAGED WITHIN THE PREFERENCE

CLAIM AREA

Under Division 1A of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901, the origin of goods claimed to be the manufacture of a
country, depends upon the country in the qualifying area where the last process of manufacture occurred and
whether the allowable factory cost is not less than the specified percentage.

For goods claimed to be the manufacture of a preference country such as New Zealand, Papua New Guinea or a
Forum Island Country, the required area percentage ( except in certain specific circumstances) is not less

than 50%.

Unless there has been a process of manufacture performed on the preference claim goods within the qualifying
area, assessment of the area percentage is not considered for preferential rules of origin.

In considering the last process of manufacture criterion, certain minimal processes are regarded as not meeting
this criterion. One such process is the packaging of goods for export to Australia.

The packaging of different goods into a boxed set is regarded as a minimal process which by itself does not
satisfy the ""last process of manufacture"" criterion. Where goods from outside the qualifying area are packaged
together with goods from within the qualifying area, the goods from outside the qualifying area cannot take the
origin of the country where the packaging takes place.

For example, where Italian goods are boxed or packaged in New Zealand

with New Zealand goods, the boxed set cannot take the origin of New Zealand. The Italian goods still retain the
origin of Italy and the New Zealand goods retain the origin of New Zealand.

Preferential rates of Customs duty cannot be claimed on the complete boxed set as the origin of New Zealand.

In such circumstances, each individual good should be identified separately on Customs documentation and the
general rate of duty is applicable for those goods from outside the qualifying area.

Further details on packaging and minimal processes can be obtained by contacting Wayne Kathage (06) 275
6512.

CUSTOMS ACT 1901 - PART XVB REVIEW OF ANTI-DUMPING

MEASURES ON CANNED TOMATOES FROM ITALY &amp;

SPAIN

In ACDN 95/42 of 19 October 1995, the Australian Customs Service notified the commencement of a review of
countervailing duties applicable to exports of canned tomatoes from Italy and Spain.

During the course of this review, Customs identified the need to update measures to take account of recent duty
changes. Customs has also contemplated whether it would be possible to maintain the levels of assistance while
simplifying the layout of the current published instructions used by both importers and Customs. Some
possibilities in this regard include:

A simplified structure for both the countervailing and anti-dumping measures on canned tomatoes from Italy and
Spain, for example

reducing the number of can sizes to three (i.e. less than 500 grams/ from 500 to less than 1000grams/1000
grams and over);
adopting a uniform method of calculating duty based on a monetary rate per kilogram net weight; and,
removing the rate for 3 kilogram cans applying to all ""other"" sizes, including less than 400 grams.

Adjusting the Non Injurious Free On Board prices to take account of duty rate changes which have occurred since
the measures were originally imposed in 1992

the general rates of duty on imports of canned tomatoes have declined from 15% to 8% but these rates are
not reflected in the existing measures.

Any interested parties in this matter wishing to provide comments on the simplification of the administrative
arrangements for canned tomatoes should advise Customs of their views by
17 January 1996. Any submissions should be forwarded to Lawrie Nock, Dumping Operations Branch, Customs
House in Canberra. Alternatively, he may be contacted on telephone

INDEXATION OF CERTAIN EXCISE AND CUSTOMS TARIFF RATES AND THE DIESEL FUEL REBATE

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1987, the rates of Excise and Customs duties on spirits, beer, tobacco and
petroleum products will change on and from 1 February 1996. Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment provide the new rates.

For this indexation, the provisions require that the December index number published by the Australian Statistician is to be divided by the previous highest December or June index
number to determine the factor used to index the rates of duty. Accordingly, the December 1995 index number (118.5) has been divided by the June Quarter 1995 (116.2) to establish the
indexation factor of 1.020.

Changes have also been made to the diesel fuel rebate rates declared in accordance with sub-section 78A(5A) of the Excise Act 1901 and sub-section 164(5A) of the Customs Act
1901. The new rates of diesel fuel rebate are declared on and from 1 February 1996 and are listed in Tables 3 and 4 in the Attachment.

Applicants for diesel fuel rebate are advised that the change to the declared rates will not affect the rate of rebate payable during February 1996.

Sub-sections 164(5AA) of the Customs Act and 78A(5AA) of the Excise Act determine the rate payable in respect of eligible diesel fuel. This rate is the average of the rates of rebate,
declared by the Minister, which were in force on the last day of each of the 6 months immediately before the month in which the application for rebate was received by a Regional
Director of Customs.

This average rate can change from month to month and the rate applicable to a particular claim is shown on the payment advice forwarded to applicants.

SEA CARGO AUTOMATION: ELECTRONIC TRANSHIPMENT

RELEASES FOR TRANSHIPMENT CARGO

The Australian Customs Service has agreed to implement interim electronic automated procedures for the
screening and underbond movement of transhipment cargo reported on the Sea Cargo Automation (SCA)
system.

Under the interim proposal commencing 30 March 1996, the SCA system will generate and release electronically
reported transhipment cargo at a discharge port via a new information message code 299. The underbond
movement of transhipment cargo to another port (for export purposes) will be possible within the current
electronic procedures applying to sea cargo movements.

It should be noted that the interim proposals ONLY apply to transhipment sea cargo reported and processed
electronically. Paper transhipment entries will not be required if electronic SCA records are available.

Exemption from Export Entry:

To gain export entry exemption when transhipment cargo is reported on an export manifest, it will be necessary
for carriers to clearly demonstrate to Customs that the cargo was originally reported on the SCA system and
granted a release via SCA information message code 299.

Non-electronic export manifests providers must attach a hard copy (printout) of the SCA information message
code 299 (obtained from the users system) as evidence of transhipment status to paper manifests submitted to
the Customs.

Participants supplying electronic export manifests are not required to supply a hard copy of the message code
299 to the Customs export clearing clerk. A copy of SCA code 299 must be retained for audit purposes.

Regardless of whether a paper or electronic outwards manifest is reported to Customs, the ""EX3"" exemption
code should be quoted as the authority to deal with transhipment cargo in respect to EXIT formalities.

Reconciliation of transhipment approvals to ensure that transhipment cargo has been exported, will be subject to
Customs compliance and audit arrangements.

Transhipment sea cargo that is not reported electronically will not be covered by these interim arrangements.
Such transhipments will be subject to normal Customs arrangements including the completion of a paper
transhipment entry.

Full automation of transhipment and export requirements is being considered in conjunction with the current
evaluation of export procedures and the EXIT system.

PREPARATION OF SUBMANIFESTS FOR EXPORT CARGO

CONSOLIDATIONS POSTPONEMENT OF COMMENCEMENT

DATE

Australian Customs Notice (ACN) 95/64 dated 9 November 1995 advised industry that Section 117A of the
Customs Act had been amended to make it a mandatory requirement that persons involved in the consolidation
of cargo for exportation by ship or aircraft prepare and communicate a submanifest in respect of those goods to
Customs.

The amendment became effective on 1 July 1995, however, a period of grace was provided to give affected
parties a reasonable time to adjust. It was announced in ACN 95/64 that the new submanifest requirements
would be implemented on 1 March 1996.

The ACN advised freight forwarders, slot charterers and consolidators that they would satisfy the new reporting
requirements for export cargo consolidations by either lodging a manual submanifest with Clearing areas or via
electronic means (ie. the EXport InTegration (EXIT) system). Cut-off times were also nominated for acceptance of
manifests for processing by Customs.

Over the past two months, the Australian Customs Service (ACS) has received a number of representations on
this matter from the freight forwarding and courier industries in particular. Essentially, industry has highlighted its
desire to comply with the new requirements through electronic reporting via the EXIT system. Some industry
members have expressed concern at their ability to effectively comply via a manual system due to transport
industry and other export requirements.

The ACS has also been advised that a number of EXIT software suppliers have been unable to develop, test and
provide software to enable industry users to respond to this initiative by 1 March 1996. Therefore, in
acknowledging industry's concerns and to further assist compliance with the new reporting requirements, it has
been decided to postpone implementation until 1 May 1996. This decision has been taken on the basis that there
will be a substantial uptake of the EXIT system by 1 May 1996 by industry members to enable electronic
reporting.

It should be noted that this initiative is essentially aimed at consolidators who deal with carriers and principal
agents. Therefore, for the purposes of the legislation, a person, other than a carrier, with 2 or more
consignments, who prepares a Master Air Waybill or Courier Baggage Voucher or holds an Ocean Bill of
Lading, must prepare and communicate to Customs a submanifest for those goods. To facilitate early
reporting any other consolidator of export cargo may also prepare and communicate a submanifest to Customs
for their own export consolidations.

The ACS is pleased to note that a large number of companies involved in export cargo consolidation
throughout Australia are in the process of adjusting their procedures in anticipation of a 1 March
commencement. Those companies are encouraged to commence reporting export cargo consolidations
in accordance with the new arrangements as soon as they are in a position to do so.

If any assistance is required, please contact the Exports section in your region or Assistant Director EXIT

focus on the next five years and will be developed in consultation with industry, commercial interests and relevant
Government agencies. An Industry Consultative Group will be convened by Customs to provide advice to the
Project Team. Attached are the Terms of Reference for the Project Team.

The Project Team would like to consult with, and receive submissions from, a cross-section of industry and
commercial interests, on any of the key issues covered by the Terms of Reference or the following related
matters:

Future practices, procedures and information requirements in relation to import and export cargo. For example,
without limiting the scope of this issue, submissions may include suggestions relating to the report, movement,
carriage, storage, entry, payment and clearance of goods;

Suggestions or proposals for streamlining and simplifying the flow of information relating to import and export
cargo, to better facilitate the physical movement of the cargo and minimise the Customs impact on international
trade;

Electronic commerce practices (""the process of doing business electronically"") to complement future import and
export cargo management needs;

Policy and legislative impediments to the effective management of imports and exports.

Submissions are encouraged from any interested parties including importers, exporters, customs brokers,
shipping/airline companies, freight forwarders, air express companies, cargo consolidators, depot and warehouse
proprietors, cargo terminal operators, financial institutions, communications providers and software houses, and
any related industry associations.

The Project Team will also consult widely on the key issues with Customs staff, unions and relevant Government
agencies.

SUSPENSION OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL

SANCTIONS AGAINST THE COUNTRIES OF THE FORMER

YUGOSLAVIA - AMENDMENTS TO CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED

IMPORTS) REGULATIONS AND CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED

EXPORTS) REGULATIONS BACKGROUND

BACKGROUND

Australian Customs Notice (ACN) No. 92/94 dated 5 June 1992, advised of amendments to the Customs
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations to implement United Nations
Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 757 of 30 May 1992, imposing economic and trade sanctions against the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (FRY). Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation 4QB
and Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulation 13CC were inserted as a result of this UN decision.

In May 1993, both the Customs (Prohibited Imports) and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations were
further amended to extend the sanctions to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia
in accordance with UNSC Resolution 820 of 17 April 1993. As a result of this UN decision, Regulation 4QC
Customs (Prohibited Imports) and Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulation 13CD were inserted. ACN No. 93/81
of 13 May 1993 refers.

Regulations 4QB and 4QC of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations prohibit the importation of all goods
from, or originating in, the FRY or the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Republic of Croatia without
the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or an authorised person. Similarly, regulations 13CC and 13CD
of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations prohibit the exportation of all goods the immediate or final
destination of which is, or is intended to be, any of those Republics without the permission of the Minister for
Foreign Affairs or an authorised person.

In December 1995, in accordance with UNSC Resolution 1022 of 22 November 1995, the existing sanctions were
suspended, except insofar as they related to the Bosnian Serb party and any funds or assets of the FRY
previously frozen or impounded within Australia.

As this resolution was a ""suspension"" rather than a ""termination"" of the earlier sanctions, which did not apply to
certain parties, the measure was implemented in the form of general permissions rather than amendment to the
Customs Prohibited Imports and Exports Regulations.

Australian laws implementing sanctions against the FRY continue to apply to the assets and funds within
Australia that are owned or controlled by the FRY or a public utility owned by the FRY. These laws remain in force
pending resolution among the successor states of the issue of succession to the property of the former Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

On 29 February 1996, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised the Australian Customs Service that
the Secretary-General of NATO had advised the Secretary General of the United Nations that the Bosnian Serb
forces had withdrawn from the zones of separation set out in the Dayton Peace Agreement, thereby satisfying the
requirements of UNSC Resolution 1022 for suspension of the remaining sanctions against the Bosnian Serb
party.

GENERAL EFFECT ON IMPORTS/EXPORTS

The net effect of this latest suspension is as follows:

the removal of all UN directed Customs import controls against the relevant Republics; and

the retention of Australian laws implementing sanctions on the exportation from Australia, of goods
owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by FRY or a public utility of FRY. Such exportations are
prohibited without the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or an authorised person.

CONTINGENCY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE REPORTING OF

EXPORT CARGO SUBMANIFESTS

BACKGROUND

Australian Customs Notice (ACN) 95/64 dated 9 November 1995 advised industry that Section 117A of the
Customs Act had been amended to make it a mandatory requirement that persons involved in the consolidation
of cargo for exportation by ship or aircraft prepare and communicate a submanifest in respect of those goods to
Customs.

Freight forwarders, slot charterers and consolidators can satisfy the new reporting requirements for export cargo
consolidations by either lodging a paper submanifest with Clearing sections or via electronic means (ie. the
EXport InTegration (EXIT) system). This new requirement commences on and from 1 May 1996.

All export cargo is reported on the EXIT system, whether transmitted electronically by persons connected to EXIT
or input by Customs staff from paper submanifests and main manifests. ACN 95/64 advised that contingency
arrangements for processing submanifests when EXIT is down were being developed and would be available
prior to the introduction of the new submanifest arrangements.

INTRODUCTION OF CONTINGENCY ARRANGEMENTS

Contingency arrangements have now been developed to overcome EXIT system, network or software problems
that result in delays to the processing of electronic manifest messages. The arrangements involve the issuing of
contingency Customs Reference Numbers (CRNs) by Clearing Clerks to submanifest providers when they are
unable to receive a reply to an electronic submanifest message or where the EXIT system is unavailable and a
Clearing Clerk is unable to process a paper submanifest.

Paper Submanifest Providers

Freight forwarders, consolidators etc submitting paper submanifests for processing by Customs Clearing sections
should do so in accordance with ACN 95/64 and 96/09. When the EXIT system is down and Clearing officers are
unable to process the paper submanifest as normal, a contingency CRN will be issued to the paper submanifest
provider and the details of the submanifest will be input by Customs at the earliest opportunity.

Electronic Submanifest Providers

Where an electronic submanifest message has been submitted to the EXIT system but no reply has been
received and delivery of the cargo to the Container Terminal Operator (CTO), carrier, principal agent or next
consolidator is imminent, the EXIT 2 client should contact their local Customs Clearing section to determine if the
message has been received and processed by the EXIT system. If it has, the Clearing officer will be able to
advise the EXIT 2 client of the relevant CRN.

If the electronic submanifest message has not been processed by the EXIT system and the submanifest provider
urgently requires a CRN for delivery of the cargo, the Clearing section may issue a contingency CRN to the EXIT
2 client. If it is the EXIT 2 client's system problem, then the EXIT 2 client will be required to ensure the problem is
rectified and a complete and accurate electronic submanifest is lodged as soon as possible. The EXIT 2 client will
then be required to advise the Clearing section of the ""real"" CRN (ie. the one issued by EXIT) when the
submanifest is transmitted successfully to the EXIT system.

Information to be supplied when requesting a contingency CRN

An EXIT 2 client will be required to supply the following details to the Clearing officer before the contingency CRN
will be issued:

ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO THE YEAR 2000 FOR

THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY - EXPORT FACILITATION

SCHEME

The Export Facilitation Scheme forms part of the 'Administrative Arrangements to the Year 2000 for The
Automotive Industry'. The Scheme enables exporters of specified vehicles, automotive components and
automotive services to earn credits to offset duty otherwise payable on eligible automotive imports.

Following a recent review of the administrative arrangements pertaining to the Export Facilitation Scheme it has
been decided that the Australian Customs Service (Customs) will be the single point of contact for all operational
activities of the Scheme. In this transitional period the first point of contact will be:

Manager

Automotive &amp; Transport Group
Compliance Improvement
Australian Customs Service
GPO Box 2809 AA
MELBOURNE VIC 3001

Specifically, Customs will assume responsibility for the calculation of the 'automotive value added' and the
administration of the 'eligibility criteria', functions previously administered by the Melbourne Automotive Unit of the
Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST). In future, references to operational activities in the
Administrative Arrangements referring to DIST should now be read as a reference to Customs.

Responsibility for policy concerning the automotive industry remains with DIST. The contact officer is Garry
Compton (06) 276 1977.

The Administrative Arrangements for the Automotive Industry Scheme are administered jointly by Customs and
DIST. Confidential information supplied to either organisation will be treated accordingly. However, the Customs
Administration Act allows information to be given to other agencies in prescribed circumstances, and in this case
where DIST may need access to operational information to clarify a policy issue.

Regulation 9 of the Customs (Prohibited Export) Regulations controls the exportation of those commodities listed
in Schedule 7 of the Customs (Prohibited Export) Regulations. Schedule 7 goods cover: alumina, bauxite, coal,
mineral sands (ilmenite, upgraded ilmenite or synthetic rutile, leucoxene, monazite, rutile, xenotime and zircon)
and liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The exportation of Schedule 7 commodities is prohibited unless a permission in writing to export has been
granted by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy or an authorised person.

Statutory Rules Nos 47 - 50, notified in Gazette No S145 of 30 April 1996, amended the Customs (Prohibited
Export) Regulations to remove the export licensing controls on the above minerals. Export controls will however
remain on monazite and xenotime under Regulation 11, Schedule 9 of the Customs (Prohibited Export)
Regulations, as these materials have low level radioactive content.

Exporters of alumina, bauxite, coal, mineral sands and LNG should note that for the purposes of ACS export
documentation, they are no longer required to quote a permit number on export entries.

AMENDMENTS TO CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED IMPORTS)

REGULATIONS REGARDING FIREARM CONTROLS

Following the Port Arthur tragedy, a special meeting of the Australasian Police Minister's Council (APMC) adopted
a number of resolutions aimed at effective national firearm controls.

The Prime Minister announced on Friday 10 May 1996 that the Commonwealth Government would introduce a
total ban on the importation of automatic and semi-automatic weapons. The importation of fully automatic
weapons is presently prohibited under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. While the importation of
semi-automatic weapons was already subject to some controls under these Regulations, the Regulations have
been amended to tighten these controls in accordance with the APMC Resolutions.

The Australian Customs Service is enforcing these new controls in addition to the controls on the importation of
firearms already contained in the Regulations.

Statutory Rule No. 59, gazetted in Special Gazette No. S165 of 14 May 1996, amended the Customs (Prohibited
Imports) Regulations to implement changes to the controls on firearms. As a consequence the importation of self-
loading and pump action longarms is now prohibited except for certain types and under limited circumstances.

The following additional categories of firearms are prohibited absolutely except when imported for official
purposes:

all semi-automatic centre fire rifles;
semi-automatic or pump action shotguns fitted or capable of being fitted, with a magazine having a capacity of
more than 5 rounds;
semi-automatic rimfire rifles fitted or capable of being fitted, with a magazine having a capacity of more than
10 rounds.

The following additional firearms are prohibited unless an importer has obtained a statement in an approved form
(B709A) issued by a Commissioner or Chief Commissioner of Police in a State or Territory to the effect that the
importer holds a licence or authorisation in accordance with the law of that State or Territory to possess a firearm
of that kind. State and Territory Police Ministers have agreed that the approved form will only be issued if the
firearm is intended for specific occupational purposes.

semi-automatic rimfire rifles fitted or capable of being fitted, with a magazine having a capacity no greater than
10 rounds;
semi-automatic or pump action shotguns fitted or capable of being fitted, with a magazine having a capacity no
greater than 5 rounds.

In addition an amendment to Schedule 3 of the Regulations prohibits the importation of detachable magazines
having a capacity of more than 10 rounds, for semi-automatic rimfire rifles, unless imported for official purposes.

AMENDMENTS OF IMPORT COMMODITY CLASSIFICATIONS

AND THE AUSTRALIAN HARMONIZED EXPORTS

COMMODITY CLASSIFICATION - JULY 1996

ACN 95/49 of 24 August 1995 drew the attention of importers, exporters, their brokers and agents to the above.
This ACN sought to inform users of the areas scheduled for change.

The International Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding system (or ""HS"") forms the basis for Australia's
Customs Tariff and the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification. Significant amendments will be
made to the HS in 1996 and these will impact upon roughly 10% of commodities in the Customs Tariff and the
Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification. The amendments will be reflected - to varying degrees -
at all levels of the classifications, not just the statistical code level.

ACN 95/49 also invited comment - as regards the effects of the changes at the statistical code level - to the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). To assist users in this process, it offered copies of an information paper
(1996 Changes to Commodity Classifications, catalogue 5488.0) and detailed inventories of areas scheduled for
change.

The ABS has reviewed all comments received and amended a number of inventories as a result of these reviews.

AMENDMENTS OF SCHEDULE 4 CONTAINED IN THE CUSTOMS TARIFF ACT 1995

As previously advised in ACN 96/03, the Customs Tariff Act 1995 will commence on 1 July 1996. The new Act contains a number changes to the concessional items in
Schedule 4. Some of these changes may affect the coverage of certain items.

The purpose of this ACN is to advise importers and brokers of the amendments to Schedule 4, both major and minor. The changes are summarised at Attachment ""A"". In
addition, most amendments have also required changes to the treatment codes/reference numbers and/or statistical codes for Schedule 4 items. Reference should be
made to the Working Tariff or TAPIN for these changes.

Changes have also been made to the concessions written to many Schedule 4 items which specify goods as prescribed by by-law (prescriptive), whether or not the items
have been amended. These changes will also operate on and from 1 July 1996, and include:

new by-laws to replace those previously in force for items which have had major textual or item number changes;
a by-law for new item 20B;
lapsing of by-laws for items which are no longer prescriptive;
lapsing of by-laws which have not been used for over three years;
new by-laws to replace those which were made prior to 1 January 1988; and
new by-laws to replace determinations having general application.

A concordance appears at Attachment ""B"" to assist importers and brokers in identifying the correct by-laws applying from 1 July 1996. It lists each concession in force as
at 30 June 1996 and specifies the equivalent by-law to take effect on and from 1 July 1996, where applicable. These changes will be reflected in the reference file system,
and on TAPIN from 1 July 1996.

It is possible that Part II to the Schedule of Concessional Instruments (SCI) will not be printed in time for distribution prior to 1 July 1996. As the text of some concessions
has been altered, importers and brokers should use the concordance in conjunction with TAPIN to verify the concession still applies to the goods to be imported. Any
queries regarding these changes may be directed, in the first instance, to Lyndall Milward-Bason on (06) 275 6551.

This ACN does not address the changes to the Tariff Concession System (Schedule 4 - Items 11, 19 and 50) or the Policy By-law (PBL) System (Schedule 4 - Items 43, 45,
46, 47, 52, 55, 56, 57 and 60) recently announced by the Government. Separate ACNs will be issued to explain the future administration of these systems.

ATTACHMENT ""A"" TO ACN 96/21

ITEM 1B

This item has been amended through the amalgation of the conditions contained in BL 9140013 (ie. ""certified by the Commissioner for Taxation as being eligible for tax-
deduction under s.78(1)(a)(xxvii) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936), into the the wording of the item. The item is now non-prescriptive and BL 9140013 is no longer
necessary.

ITEM 3

This item now only covers goods for the official use of the Governor-General and his family. The concession for goods for Governors and their families has been transferred
to item 10. The item remains non-prescriptive.

ITEM 4

This item has been split and retains the concession for those goods mentioned in current paragraph (a) of the item (ie. goods owned by a government of a country other
than Australia). Goods covered by paragraph (b) of old item 4 have been transferred to item 16. The current by-laws have been replaced.

ITEM 5

This item has been amended through the amalgamation of the exclusions contained in BL 8332595 - revenue goods and motor vehicles, sea and air craft - into the wording
of the item. The item is therefore non-prescriptive and needs no by-law.

ITEM 6

There are two minor changes to this item; ""intended"" has been deleted from subparagraph (a) and ""Comptroller"" has been amended to ""Chief Executive Officer"" in
subparagraph (c). The item remains non-prescriptive.

ITEM 7

Subparagraph (a) has been amended to read in part ""agreement between the Government of Australia and the government of another country or countries"". The coverage
of the item is unaffected and BL 9640001 remains unchanged.

ITEM 8

A similar change has been made to this item as in item 7. The legal instruments which were made prior to 1 January 1988 have been rewritten.

ITEM 9

Another minor change has been made to this item by the inclusion of the words ""Government of"" before Australia. The by-law which was made prior to 1 January 1988 has
been rewritten.

ITEM 10

This item has been recreated to cover goods for State Governors and their families. This concession was previously included in item 3. The item is non-prescriptive.

ITEM 12

This item has been amended to read ""Aids and appliances, as prescribed by by-law, for people with disabilities"". The coverage of the item is unaffected, however, new by-
laws have been gazetted to replace the determinations previously issued.

ITEM 14

The word ""Comptroller"" occuring 5 times has been amended to ""Chief Executive Officer"". The item is non-prescriptive.

Further to ACNs 95/48 and 96/03, subscribers are advised that the new working tariff issued in conjunction with the implementation of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (CT96) was mailed
from Canberra on 28 May 1996. It should be remembered that it will not come into effect until 1 July 1996 and the document completely replaces the working tariff currently being used.

Tariff users are reminded of the criteria used in displaying rates of duty in the new Tariff -

the rate of duty for Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province is prefixed with the symbol ""DCT"";
the symbol ""DCS"" covers the same list of developing countries as previously. These countries appear in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to CT96;
if a ""DCT"" rate is not shown in Schedule 3 or Schedule 4 and a ""DCS"" rate is shown, then the ""DCS"" rate denotes the ""DCT"" rate of duty;
if no ""DCS"" or ""DCT"" rate is shown, then the General rate of duty applies.

Preference indicators used in the COMPILE system will not change.

A number of changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 will be proposed in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (1996) before the Act comes into effect. Most of these are of an administrative
nature and will not affect either the description of goods, Section or Chapter Notes or rates of duty. The changes of substance are outlined below -

the re-enactment of new rates of duty for beer and certain spirits and alcoholic beverages of Chapter 22, manufactured tobacco and tobacco products of Chapter 24 and petroleum
products of Chapter 27. This is necessary to give legal effect in CT96 to the new rates of duty following the Consumer Price Index adjustments on 1 February 1996. The new rates are
already contained in the Tariff that has been distributed.
heading 4801 covering newsprint has been restructured. This was undertaken because of an incorrect interpretation of revised Note 3 to Chapter 48 and subsequent representations
from the Paper and Paperboard Industry. The new structure is -

RE-INSTATEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROLS ON SCHEDULE 7

ITEMS OF THE CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED EXPORTS)

REGULATIONS

Australian Customs Notice (ACN) No. 96/17 dated 9 May 1996, advised of the removal of export licensing
controls over commodities listed in Schedule 7 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Schedule 7
goods covered: alumina, bauxite, coal, mineral sands (ilmenite, upgraded ilmenite or synthetic rutile, leucoxene,
monazite, rutile, xenotime and zircon) and liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The exportation of Schedule 7 commodities had previously been prohibited under Regulation 9 of the Customs
(Prohibited Exports) Regulations unless a permission in writing to export had been granted by the Minister for
Primary Industries and Energy or an authorised person.

On 23 May 1996, the Senate disallowed the regulations which amended the Customs (Prohibited Exports)
Regulations. The disallowance by the Senate re-instates the previous controls over the export of the Schedule 7
commodities.

Consequently, on and from 24 May 1996, exporters of alumina, bauxite, coal, mineral sands and LNG should
note they are once more required to quote a Mineral Export Permit (MEP) number, issued by the Department of
Primary Industries and Energy, on export entries.

Exporters will need to obtain a MEP number for those goods which were given an Authority to Deal during the
period 30 April to 24 May 1996 inclusive.

Any enquiries concerning these amendments should be directed to the Department of Primary Industries and
Energy, Canberra on (06) 272 5739.

for (L B WOODWARD)
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

5 June 1996

(Cargo Facilitation File: C96/05122)

Exporters should note that any authority to deal obtained prior to 24 May 1996, and granted by Customs on the
basis that no permissions were required under Regulation 9 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations,
were, under law, validly obtained. Accordingly, exportation can therefore take place without the requirement for
further permissions.

From 24 May 1996, before Customs can deal with goods pursuant to Section 114 of the Customs Act, the
relevant permissions are required.

However, exporters should also note that in respect of those goods previously granted export permission, unless
exportation takes place within 30 days of the intended date of export, under the requirements of Section 116 of
the Customs Act, the authority to deal is taken to have been revoked. In such circumstances, a new permit to
export will be required to be obtained from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.

However, a Mineral Export Permit (MEP) number will be re-issued for those goods, which are now the subject of
the re-instated Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, and for which an Authority to Deal was issued prior to
24 May (on the basis that no permission was required).

AMENDMENTS TO CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED IMPORTS)

REGULATIONS. INTRODUCTION OF NEW SIMPLIFIED

CONTROL STRUCTURE FOR FIREARMS IMPORTS AND

ASSOCIATED PARTS AND ACCESSORIES

Following the announcement by the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth Government would introduce a total
ban on the import of automatic and semi-automatic weapons, the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations were
amended. These amendments were notified in Australian Customs Notice 96/19 and were Gazetted in Special
Gazette S165 of 14 May 1996. The amendments had effect on and from that day.

In announcing these amendments the Minister responsible for Customs, the Hon Geoff Prosser MP, stated that
the Customs regulations covering restrictions on firearms imports would be redrafted and simplified. This has now
occurred and a new set of Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations relating to firearms comes into effect on and
from 5 June 1996. Statutory Rule No. 91 refers.

An outline of the new regulations is as follows:

Structure

The existing restrictions which are contained in six Regulations and three Schedules will be consolidated into new
Regulation 4F and Schedule 6.

Regulation 4F

Regulation 4F provides that the importation of a firearm is prohibited unless it is a firearm to which an item in Part
2 of Schedule 6 applies and importation is in accordance with the requirements set out in that Part. These
requirements will fall into four broad categories or ""tests""

1. the official purpose test

2. the specified purposes test

3. the specified person test; and

4. the Police authorisation test

The details of each test are set out in Part 1 of Schedule 6. Further conditions are specified in Part 3 of Schedule
6.

Unique Serial Number

All firearms being imported will be required to bear a unique serial number which will be essential to the effective
implementation of a national registration scheme

Definition of ""Firearm""

The present definition of ""firearm"" has been expanded to include articles which resemble a firearm (whether or
not the device actually performs the functions of a firearm). This will result in such articles being subject to the
same controls as the firearms they resemble and will directly address Government concerns with the increasing
use of such devices in criminal activities.

TARIFF QUOTAS - CHEESE AND CURD ALLOCATION FOR

1996/97

The annual allocation of cheese and curd tariff quotas for 1996/97 will be based on a rolling 23 month average of
import performance (ending 31 May 1996). This period of allocation has been adopted so as to reflect
contemporary quota use.

Quota transferred or quota unused at the end of a financial year will not be recognised as import performance for
quota allocation purposes.

Importers will be advised of their entitlement based on Australian Customs Service records of clearances for
home consumption during the base period. Letters advising importers of their quota allocation for the period
beginning 1 July 1996-30 June 1997 will be dispatached later this month.

Allocations of quota are transferable. Applications to transfer quota entitlements may be made by completing a

TARIFF AMENDMENT ACT (No. 1) 1996 (CTAA)

The CAA and the CTAA will come into effect on 15 July 1996 and provide respectively:

substantial amendments to the Tariff Concession System (TCS), and
a 3% duty rate for Item 50 and the introduction of new Item 50A applying a ""Free"" duty rate to consumption
goods covered by a Tariff Concession Order (TCO) or Commercial Tariff Concession Order (CTCO).

The CAA amending Part XVA of the Customs Act was passed by Parliament on 27 June 1996. Part XVA of the
Customs Act contains the legislative provisions for the TCS.

The CAA implements the significant amendments to the TCS which were recommended in the 1995 joint
Department of Industry, Science and Technology/Customs evaluation of the TCS.

The CTAA was passed by Parliament on 28 June 1996. It prescribes 3% duty for Item 50 of Schedule 4 to the
tariff, but with provision for duty free entry of consumption goods under new Item 50A. Attached to this ACN is a
list of tariff classifications identifying consumption goods.

Changes to the TCS were foreshadowed in the February 1996 election campaign and the Government's
intentions were clarified in subsequent round table discussions with industry. The Government also took note of
options proposed by a Department of Industry, Science and Tourism/Customs task force, which was set up to
consider issues resulting from the round table discussions.

The TCS reforms complement the Government's revenue demands for its budget deficit reduction programme
and will lead to streamlined TCS administration. The administrative burden of requiring local manufacturers to
object to every TCO application for which there are substitutable goods will be removed.

KEY TCS REFORMS

The key reform to the TCS involves deleting paragraph 269C(b) from the core criteria against which TCO
applications are assessed. This provision is generally referred to as the ""market test"" and has been a highly
contentious element of the TCS.

From 15 July 1996 a TCO application will be assessed against core criteria requiring that, on the day a TCO
application is received by Customs, no substitutable goods were produced in Australia in the ordinary course of
business.

The definition of substitutable goods as set out in subsection 269B(1) is further clarified to ensure that no defacto
market test is injected into the definition.

New ss269B(3) provides that in determining whether goods produced in Australia are put, or are capable of being
put, to a use that corresponds with a use that goods the subject of a TCO or TCO application can be put, no
account will be taken of whether the Australian made goods actually compete in any market with the TCO goods.
The focus of the substitutable goods definition is solely upon the correspondence of use or capability of use
between the locally made good and the imported good. Evidence of direct competition in a market to establish
whether locally made and imported goods are put to corresponding uses, and therefore substitutable, is
completely irrelevant.

The CAA now provides the following main definitions:

The Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) forms part of the 'Administrative Arrangements to the Year 2000 for The
Automotive Industry'. The Scheme is designed to encourage the manufacture and export of value-added products
in Australia. It applies to specified passenger motor vehicles (PMVs), automotive components, automotive
machine tools and tooling and automotive design, development and production services.

As a result of a recent government decision, eligibility for the EFS has been extended to facilitate the eligibility for
products of emerging technologies.

The Export Facilitation Scheme Arrangements to the 'Administrative Arrangements to the Year 2000 for the
Automotive Industry' are amended by:

1. the inclusion of a new part (d) to C1.2.1 to read as follows:

""(d) Products and services of emerging technology designed initially for use as OE in vehicles falling to Chapter
87 of Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and which are demonstrated to have strong potential for later
application as OE in vehicles which, if produced in Australia, would be considered to be specified PMVs

(See Part C:1.2.3 b.)""

2. the existing C:1.2.3 shall now be read as:

""C:1.2.3 a. The eligibility to earn export credits for the products and services identified in Part C:1.2.1 c. will be
determined by the Australian Customs Service in the following manner:

Automotive Machine Tools and Automotive Tooling

When determining whether machine tools or tooling qualify as automotive machine tools (see Glossary) or
automotive tooling (see Glossary) eligible to earn export credits, the Australian Customs Service, will give
consideration to the product or products which will ultimately be produced by the machine tool or tooling. Eligible
export status will only be granted where the principal use of the machine tool or the tooling is the manufacture of
PMVs and automotive components of a type specified in Parts C:1.2.1 a. and

b.. Machine tools or tooling used for the production of raw materials, goods in bulk or goods that require cutting to
length or shape (see Part A:1.4.4) will not be eligible.

Australian Automotive Design, Development and Production Services

When determining the eligibility of Australian automotive design, development and production services (see
Glossary) the Australian Customs Service will require:

that the service must be based in Australia;

that the service must be for a specific defined outcome; and

evidence of a bona fide contract for the provision of the service activity.

Only automotive design, development and production service activity undertaken on or after 1 January 1991
will be eligible to earn export credits.

b. Eligibility under Part C:1.2.1(d) will require explicit articulation by applicants of the link between the use of
the product as OE in vehicles other than PMVs and their later use as OE in PMVs, the rationale for using a
non-PMV vehicle falling to Chapter 87 of Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 for the initial market for
the product, and the intended time frame in which the product will be incorporated as OE in PMVs. The intent
of this provision is to encourage the development and advancement of PMV oriented technology in Australia

1. INTRODUCTION

Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) establishes the rate of duty to be paid on goods imported
into Australia. The principal objective of the duties imposed by that Schedule is to provide assistance to
Australian manufacturers of goods. However, the structure of the Tariff is such that some goods not made in
Australia also become subject to duty. Under certain conditions, the Government will forgo the collection of the full
duty on goods not made in Australia.

Section 18 of the Tariff provides the authority for goods specified in Schedule 4 of that Act to enter at a rate of
duty below that set out in Schedule 3. The items contained in Schedule 4 provide the legal basis for concessional
entry of certain goods in prescribed circumstances. For example, Items 50 and 50A of Schedule 4 provide for the
concessional entry of goods that are the subject of Tariff Concession Orders (TCO) made through the Tariff
Concession (TC) System.

Other Items in Schedule 4 provide for the concessional entry of goods to suit a wide range of specified
circumstances and to satisfy particular Government objectives. Of particular relevance to this ACN, Schedule 4
contains a number of items that allow goods to be entered at concessional rates of duty where the entry of those
goods is considered to contribute significantly to the Government's overall industry policy objectives, in particular,
through a reduction in business input costs in specified circumstances.

This latter category of nine items constitutes what is known as the PBL System. The items that are generally
considered to fall within the ambit of the PBL system include items 43, 45, 46, 47, 52, 55, 56, 57 and 60 of
Schedule 4 to the Tariff.

This ACN is intended to serve as a guide to the operation of the revised system. It endeavours to clarify the legal,
policy and administrative criteria underpinning the System and to provide advice on the processes for lodging
requests for concessional entry which will apply from 15 July 1996.

The key legislative and policy changes to commence on 15 July 1996 include:

(i) the revocation of current policy by-laws instruments (both by-laws and determinations) made under items 43,
45, 46, 52 and 56, together with the treatment of any requests for a by-law or determination made under any of
those five items as at 15 July 1996 as a request subject to the new legislative and policy criteria applying to those
five items post 15 July 1996 (item 42 of the CAA);

(ii) introduction of in-transit arrangements for goods falling within items 43, 45, 46, 52 and 56 (item 43 of the
CAA);

(iii) the retention of a free duty rate on each of the PBL items, except item 47, which will attract a 3% rate and
items 43 and 52, which will attract the rate applicable to the whole good (items 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the CTAA);

(iv) the amendment of item 45 to cover ""Capital equipment for use in the mining and resource processing
industries, as prescribed by by-law"" (item 3 of the CTAA);

(v) the amendment of item 46 to cover ""Capital equipment for use in the agricultural, food processing and food
packaging industries, as prescribed by by-law"" (item 4 of the CTAA);

ELIGIBILITY FOR BOUNTY OF COMPUTER OPERATING

SOFTWARE

INTRODUCTION

The Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 (the Act) provides for the payment of a bounty to a computer manufacturer on
the basis of the value added in its production and the rate of bounty applying at the time of manufacture. One of
the eligible costs for bounty purposes is the cost of ""operating software"". Differences of opinion have arisen
among technical advisers as to the interpretation of this term. This notice is an attempt to clarify the meaning of
the term ""operating software"", and provide a practical approach to the application of this term in the assessment
of bounty claims.

BACKGROUND

It is important to note that research and development expenditure has been excluded as an eligible factory cost
by the Bounty Legislation Amendment Act 1995 (the Amendment Act). This amendment applies to all products
completed after 31 December 1995. Any subsequent bounty claims would be for the development and production
of computer ""operating software"", and not for 'research and development' activities. This change is highlighted as
many of the software claims for work completed prior to 31 December 1995 were of a research and development
nature.

It should also be said that the dialogue with industry representatives and other professionals on the question of
the definition of computer ""operating software"" has been extensive. Their contribution together with independent
legal advice has helped in the formulation of this notice.

ISSUE

The Act provides for the payment of a bounty to manufacturers on the value added in the production of computers
and ""operating software or software for testing hardware in Australia"". Paragraph 6(5)(h) of the Act excludes
costs of software, other than ""operating software"" from being eligible for bounty.

Subsection 3(1) of the Act states that ""operating software"" has the same meaning as ""operating system software""
in Australian Standard 1189 (the Standard) of the Standards Association of Australia as in force from time to time.
However, there is no such definition in the Standard. In the administration of the eligibilty criteria for ""operating
software"" there has been reliance upon the definition of ""operating system"" in Part 1 of the Standard to ascertain
eligibility of computer software for bounty. An ""operating system"" is defined as:

Software that controls the execution of programs and that may provide services such as resource allocation,
scheduling, input/output control, and data management.

The issue which has arisen is whether the definition of ""system software"" in Part 20 of the Standard, should be
read with the term ""operating system"" when establishing the meaning of ""operating system software"". ""System
software"" is defined as:

Application-independent software that supports the running of application software.

This part also defines ""application software"" as:

A software [program] that is specific to the solution of an application problem.

Without labouring the definitional terminology, an application problem is one submitted by an end user and
requiring information processing for its solution. By relying on both the definition of ""operating system"" and
""system software"" in the Standard, ""operating system software"" can be distinguished from ""application software"".

ADVICE

The Act can be taken to be distinguishing between ""operating systems software"" which is bountiable and
""application software"" which is not. There is a need to make such a distinction when considering eligibility for
bounty under the Act, as ""application software"" is clearly excluded from eligibility. However, administering

INDEXATION OF CERTAIN EXCISE AND CUSTOMS TARIFF RATES AND THE DIESEL FUEL REBATE

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of Excise and Customs duties on spirits, beer, tobacco and
petroleum products will change on and from 1 August 1996. Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment provide the new rates.

For this indexation, the provisions require that the June index number published by the Australian Statistician is to be divided by the previous highest December or June index number to
determine the factor used to index the rates of duty. Accordingly, the June 1996 index number (119.8) has been divided by the December Quarter 1995 (118.5) to establish the
indexation factor of 1.011.

Changes have also been made to the diesel fuel rebate rates declared in accordance with sub-section 78A(5A) of the Excise Act 1901 and sub-section 164(5A) of the Customs Act
1901. The new rates of diesel fuel rebate are declared on and from 1 August 1996 and are listed in Tables 3 and 4 in the Attachment.

Applicants for diesel fuel rebate are advised that the change to the declared rates will not affect the rate of rebate payable during August 1996.

Sub-sections 164(5AA) of the Customs Act and 78A(5AA) of the Excise Act determine the rate payable in respect of eligible diesel fuel. This rate is the average of the rates of rebate,
declared by the Minister, which were in force on the last day of each of the 6 months immediately before the month in which the application for rebate was received by a Regional
Director of Customs.

This average rate can change from month to month and the rate applicable to a particular claim is shown on the payment advice forwarded to applicants.

AMENDMENTS TO THE TARIFF CONCESSION SYSTEM -

Incorrect Use of Treatment Code 506

Australian Customs Notice (ACN) No.96/28 details changes to the Tariff Concession System, specifically the
change in duty rate from ""Free"" to 3% for all goods except consumption goods.

Initially, COMPILE did not have the facility to check if a quoted Tariff Concession Order (TCO) was keyed to a
consumption goods classification. This has now been rectified.

Analysis of import data since the new measures were introduced reveals significant misuse of treatment code
506. Specifically, treatment code 506, which specifies a free rate of duty for the limited class of TCOs which relate
to consumption goods, has been used in instances where a free rate of duty does not apply, that is, where the
goods in question are not consumption goods, as set out in ACN no. 96/28. The list of consumption goods has
now been incorporated in the working tariff.

The Australian Customs Service considers this as serious and is undertaking a comprehensive audit of treatment
code 506 usage, with a view to undertaking recovery and possible penalty action in cases of incorrect use.
Recovery action will commence on 30 August 1996.

In the meantime, importers and Customs brokers are advised to check all uses of treatment code 506 with a view
to ensuring that the tariff classification quoted correctly identifies the goods imported as consumption goods.
Where an error has occurred, importers or brokers should lodge an amending entry which uses the correct
treatment code for Tariff Concession Order goods, that is:

. treatment code 505 - for goods the subject of a TCO and which are now dutiable at 3%; or

. treatment code 506 - for goods the subject of a TCO which are consumption goods as set out in ACN no.96/28
and which remain dutiable at the ""free"" rate of duty.

The above arrangements also apply to advance entries, lodged before 15 July 1996 for goods arriving on or after
this date, which have quoted (old) treatment code 500 and claimed a free rate where the goods are now dutiable
at 3% and treatment code 505 applies.

COMPILE users would be aware that advice concerning the detection of incorrect entries and notice of proposed
audit action was given on 17 July 1996 via a Broadcast message.

BRANCH NAME CHANGES

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) provides advice about the name changes of two Branches within the
Australian Customs Service.

Commercial Compliance

The Compliance Improvement Branch in Central Office and regional Compliance Improvement units have now
been renamed ""Commercial Compliance"".

The new title more clearly conveys the responsibilities of this Branch but does not detract from the compliance
improvement philosophy which Customs will continue to pursue.

Border Operations

The Border Administration Branch has now been renamed ""Border Operations.""

The new title is designed to highlight the border activity itself. The focus of Branch staff and management is
directed towards outcomes that identify risks requiring an active operational response rather than a passive
control or administrative approach.

GUIDELINES ON PRUDENTIAL AUDIT

The Government's response to the Review of the Australian Customs Service required that a working party be established to fully investigate the concept of prudential audit. The
Working Partyreported on 27 July 1995.

The Working Party defined a prudential audit to be:

""an audit arranged and funded by a company to assure itself about its level of compliance with statutory or other requirements"".

The Working Party's conclusion and recommendations as advisedin ACN 95/57 were:

Having regard to the various issues raised in the course of this exercise, the Working Party is of the view that the most viable option for the ACS is a voluntary arrangement under
which:

a company may choose (as it may do now) to commission a prudential audit to assure itself about its level of compliance with Customs legislation,

Customs would provide guidelines aimed at assisting industry to ensure that such audits represent value for money (these should be tailored to take account of the commercial realities
of particular industry sectors), and

the results of such audits would be taken into account when Customs assesses the risk associated with that company.

In this context it is important for industry to recognise that, while a prudential audit can be a worthwhile tool in ensuring compliance with Customs requirements, it cannot be regarded as
a mechanism for avoiding a Customs audit.

The primary objective of Customs audits is to assess a company's level of compliance with legal requirements. In doing this particular emphasis is placed on the evaluation of a
company's internal systems, controls and procedures which produce the information communicated to Customs. In this regard, Customs has developed a company audit methodology
based on Australian Auditing Standards (AUS 1). The philosophy and methodology have been published in Volumes 23 and 24 of the ACS Manuals which are now available for
purchase by the public refers.

As the adopted methodology has general application, the need to tailor the guidelines for particular industry sectors will be further considered in the light of operational experience.

Companies choosing to commission a prudential audit to gain assurance about levels of compliance with Customs legislation may use the Customs Company Audit Methodology as a
guide.

The results of any prudential audits provided to Customs will influence decisions on risk assessments and judgements on the extent to which Customs audits need to be pursued. In
assessing the results of a prudential audit, Customs will take into account the extent to which the audit meets professional standards in accordance with the published Customs
guidelines.

TEMPORARY IMPORTATION OF GOODS

The Australian Customs Service (Customs) is undertaking a review of the administration of Sections 162 and
162A of the Customs Act 1901 to ensure that policy objectives are being met.

Under the provisions of Sections 162 and 162A of the Customs Act goods may be temporarily imported in certain
circumstances. The Regulations made for the purposes of those Sections set out the conditions, restrictions and
requirements for temporary importation.

The review will consider, among other things, the operation of Regulation 124(1)(b)(iv) in relation to the
importation of goods ""for other industrial purposes"". The Regulation provides that for the purposes of Section 162
of the Customs Act goods imported for assembly or other industrial purposes approved by the Regional Director
are prescribed classes of goods.

Pending the outcome of the review, the decision to grant approval for the temporary importation of goods ""for
other industrial purposes"" will be considered on the basis that goods which are to have work done to them may
be granted an approval, but goods which are to perform work will not. For example, an approval to import will not
be given for goods which could be described as stand alone machinery or equipment such as an excavator
unless those goods are to be imported to have work done to them and then exported. However, an approval may
be given in respect of machinery or equipment which is:

. to be assembled in Australia and then exported; or

. incorporated in goods which are assembled in Australia and then exported.

Importers who intend to temporarily import goods should continue to apply for approval at the Regional Offices of
the Australian Customs Service.

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS

ACT 1995

See ACN96/46 for erratum to this ACN

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given
notice under section 132 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting
to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have
applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes
the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection
remain in force for a period of two years from the commencement
date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods
refer to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 in the
Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the
contrary, the particular trade mark relates to the specific goods
listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where
certain objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard
to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it
has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies
of some of those Notices.

The Schedule clearly indicates where that applies with an asterisk.
In any case prospective importers should seek further advice regarding
the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs
office (in accordance with the final paragraph below).Where goods
of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and
are imported with a sign that is substantially identical with
or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable
to be seized by Customs, unless it can be established that: the
goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade
(sale, lease, hire, etc.); or the goods do not infringe the relevant
trade mark. Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances
in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, amount to an
infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where
the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods
with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that
may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the Trade Marks
Act should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably
qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade
marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially
identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an
infringement of"" a trade mark. The trade mark owner's contact
particulars have been included in the Scheduleto assist importers
who may wish to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade
marks in question.

""IN TRANSIT"" PROVISIONS FOR MADE-TO-ORDER CAPITAL

EQUIPMENT - FIRM ORDER DATE (FOD)

On 26 June 1996 a new field called Firm Order Date (FOD) was created in COMPILE to cater for the TCO ""in
transit"" provision contained in subsection 269SG(4) of the Customs Act1901. On Monday 15 July 1996 the
operation of this field was modified to take into account changes included in the Customs Amendment Act 1996.

The FOD field may be used for goods entered under Commercial Tariff Concession Orders (CTCOs), Tariff
Concession Orders (TCOs), By-Laws (BLs) and Determinations (MDs) that have been revoked and are subject to
""in transit"" provisions under item 43 of Schedule 1 to the Customs Amendment Act 1996 or sub-section 269SG(4)
of the Customs Act1901, as amended by the forementioned Act. These provisions apply to made-to-order capital
equipment for which firm orders had been placed between the date the relevant revoked instrument came into
force and the date it was revoked.

The FOD field allows such equipment to be entered under the instrument despite its revocation, provided the
goods comply with the terms of the revoked instrument and the Schedule 4 item to which it was written, as
amended or proposed to be altered. The duty rate that will apply to the goods is the rate applicable to the relevant
item at the time the goods are entered for home consumption. These provisions do not permit goods to be
entered at a duty rate other than that which would have applied had the instrument not been revoked.

For the purposes of these provisions, the operative or start date of a revoked instrument will be taken to be the
date the instrument came into force. The definition of ""made-to-order capital equipment"", derived from
subsections 269B(1) and 269SG(5) of the Customs Act 1901, as amended by the Customs Amendment
Act 1996, is as follows:

A particular item of equipment to which Chapters 84, 85, 86, 87, 89 or 90 of Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff
Act 1995 applies:

(a) that is made on a one-off basis to meet a specific order rather than being the subject of regular or intermittent
production; and

(b) that is not produced in quantities indicative of a production run.

Goods eligible for other ""in transit"" provisions [for example, subsection 269SG(2) of the Customs Act 1901] do not
need to use the FOD field. The Customs Commercial System should process such entries automatically.

An example of where FOD could be used would be where a user inputs a revoked TCO on an entry and receives
the error ""Instrument is not current"". As long as the circumstances surrounding the entry comply with the rules set
out below, and the goods are made-to-order capital equipment which meets the terms of the relevant instrument
and item, the user will be able to use FOD. The user simply inputs in the Miscellaneous Header field (MISC HDR)
or Additional Information (ADD INFO) field on a single or parent line, the date on which the firm order for the
goods was placed, in the form ""FOD=ddmmyy"" (for example, ""FOD=101295"" would be input for a firm order
placed on 10 December 1995). FOD may be used on COMPILE or Manual entries.

The rules governing FOD are set out below.

1) FOD is allowed on nature 10, 11, 12, 30, 31 or 32 entries only.

2) FOD must be a valid date.

3) FOD must be earlier than Valuation Date (DTVA) if used on a Nature 10.

4) The Reference Files must specify that the instrument quoted has an 'In Transit Provisions Apply' report code
(report code 60).

5) The tariff classification must fall within one of the chapters covering capital equipment for the purposes of the
""in transit"" provisions, namely Chapters 84, 85, 86, 87, 89 or 90 of Schedule 3.

6) The instrument quoted must be a CTCO, TCO, BL or MD.

DECREASE IN EXCISE AND CUSTOMS DUTY ON AVIATION

GASOLINE AND AVIATION KEROSENE

In a media release dated 20 August 1996, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development announced a
reduction of 0.75 cents per litre in the duty rates on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene.

The duty rate reduction stems from the over recovery during 1995/96 of the aviation industry's contribution to
service the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The industry contribution is collected by the Commonwealth through a
levy included in the Excise and Customs duty on these aviation fuels. Excise Tariff Notice No.1 (1996) and
Customs Tariff Notice No.1 (1996), published in Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. S323 of 30 August
1996, detail alterations proposed to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to apply new rates
of Excise and Customs duty to these fuels.

The new rates for aviation gasoline ($0.17931 per litre) and aviation kerosene ($0.01778 per litre) operate on and
from 1 September 1996. Tariff pages to be issued in connection with these changes are: Excise - E64 (R.9)and
E65 (R.12) Customs - Chapter 27/6 (R. 2)

COST RECOVERY - IMPORT PROCESSING

In the August 1996 Budget, the Government announced that from 1 January 1997 the Australian Customs Service will apply cost recovery for commercial customs activities required to
process imports. These arrangements will require the passage of appropriate legislation before recovery can be implemented.

The services to be covered by the new charges are:

- cargo reporting (both sea and air)

- import entry processing - sea, air and post.

The current Cargo Automation Processing Charge will be absorbed by the new charges. Charges will not apply to the processing of export transactions, nor will they cover activity
associated with Customs community protection functions relating to the detection and interception of prohibited imports and drugs.

Customs has undertaken a detailed activity based costing of its services to ensure that the costs recovered are clearly aligned to the costs calculated to process import transactions. The
charges proposed are limited to the calculated costs of delivering the functions. Charges will be reviewed annually to ensure that they reflect any changes in the costing structure,
including efficiencies.

The proposed charges, detailed below, have been amended since first discussed at the Customs National Consultative Committee (CNCC) on Friday 23 August 1996. The amendments
are revenue neutral, changing the structure of electronic entry charges, the line charges for manual entries and making the manual refund application fee a flat rate. Investigation of
appropriate and efficient collection mechanisms continues. Additional ACN's will be released over the implementation phase outlining details of new administrative arrangements. It is
also proposed that a series of industry briefing sessions will be held in regional capitals over the next few months.

RENEWAL OF CUSTOMS AGENT'S AND CORPORATE

CUSTOMS AGENTS' LICENCES

All Customs Agent's Licences and Corporate Customs Agents' Licences on issue expire on 31 December 1996.
Sub-section 183J(1) of the Customs Act 1901, (the Act), provides for the renewal of licences.

As in previous years ""Application for Renewal of Customs Agents' Licence"" (Form B259 - Corporate and Sole
Trader and Form B260 - Nominee) will be distributed to all Customs Agents and Corporate Customs Agents
currently licensed with the Australian Customs Service (Customs). Licence holders will be permitted to renew
their licences in any State or Territory. Current licence holders wishing to renew their licences should make written
application on their Form B260 or B259 to the Regional Director (the RD) on or before 31 December 1996.

It should be noted that failure to renew a licence by c.o.b. 31 December 1996 will render the licence invalid. This
will mean that individuals or corporate bodies who have not renewed their licences by that date, but who still wish
to be licensed, will be required to make a new application to the relevant RD. Following receipt of the new
application the RD, pursuant to Section 183CB of the Act, will forward the Application to the National Customs
Agents' Licensing Advisory Committee (NCALAC) for report to him/her as to whether the applicant should be
licensed or not.

In order to facilitate the processing of the Forms B260 and B259 by Customs, licence holders intending to renew
their licences, are requested to complete either their Form B260 or B259 and lodge it with the RD well before 31
December 1996.

NOTE: Customs, in concert with the Customs Brokers' Councilof Australia Inc. (the CBCA) and the
NCALAC, is currently conducting a review of the Customs Brokers' Licensing System. As part of the
review, the review team is considering the possibility of renewing licences by c.o.b. 30 June every three
or five years. The reason being to avoid the present confusion caused by renewing them by 31 December
every year when the majority of people are on holiday and the industry is not in full swing.

An Australian Customs Notice regarding the overall findings of the review will be issued at a later date.

Corporate Customs Agents are also requested to include with their application form:

1. a list of all nominees currently employed with their Agency;
2. a list of all persons currently having authority to directthe nominees of the Agency for the purposes of the Act.

In relation to this request Corporate Agents are reminded that, in accordance with Sub-section 183CG(3) of the
Act, it is a condition of their licence that the Chief Executive Officer be advised within thirty (30) days of a change
of nominees, persons authorised to direct nominees or composition of a partnership.

Payment of Fees

Fees in respect of the renewal of an Agent's licence are to be paid not later than the day on which the renewal of
the licence is to come into force (Customs Regulation No. 160).

In order to facilitate the renewal process further, payment of fees should be made at the same time the completed
""Application for Renewal of Agent's Licence "" (Forms B259 and B260 ) are lodged with the relevant RD.

Fees Payable (Customs Regulation 158)The fee payable in respect of the grant or renewal of an Agent's Licence
is:

1. where the Customs Agent is a natural person who does notintend to act, at any time when the licence is in

force in his/herown right - $20; or

2. in any other case - $200.

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS

ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under section 132 of the Trade Marks Act
1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to them, or in relation to
them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force
for a period of two years from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in
Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade
mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain
objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it
has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice
regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final
paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is
substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to be seized by
Customs, unless it can be established that:

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or
the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not,
amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions
of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially
identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark. The trade mark owner's contact
particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish to initiate negotiations regarding
use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each
State and Territory.

Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of Objection, or Customs' role
in regard to those Notices, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and Restrictions Group in the Australian

INTRODUCTION OF CONTROLS ON THE DRUG ""FANTASY""

AMENDMENT TO THE CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED IMPORTS)

AND (PROHIBITED EXPORTS) REGULATIONS AND

CUSTOMS (NARCOTIC SUBSTANCES) REGULATIONS

The abuse of the substance known as ""Fantasy"" has recently come to attention following a recent incident in
Queensland in which eight people were hospitalised after taking a mixture believed to contain the substance. In
order to address public safety issues, the Minister for Health and Family Services has requested the immediate
introduction of controls on the drug as it has no approved therapeutic purpose in Australia and limited use in
some overseas countries as an anaesthetic.

Regulation 5 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations controls the importation of certain drugs by
operation of Schedule 4 to the Regulations. Regulations 10 to10F of the Customs (Prohibited Exports)
Regulations control the exportation of certain drugs by operation of Schedule 8 (Parts 1 to 4) to the Regulations.

Schedule 4 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and Schedule 8 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports)
Regulations have therefore been amended to prohibit the importation and exportation of the class of substances
""4-hydroxybutanoic acid, its salts and esters"" which includes the substance commonly known as ""Fantasy"" or
""GBH"" (Grievous Bodily Harm).

Section 235 of the Customs Act 1901 prescribes penalties (including imprisonment) for offences in relation to
trafficable quantities and commercial quantities of ""narcotic substances"". Therefore, the Schedule to the Customs
(Narcotic Substances) Regulations has also been amended to prescribe the class of substances ""4-
hydroxybutanoic acid, its salts and esters"" as a ""narcotic substance"" for the purposes of Section 235 of the Act.

The amendments to the Regulations are effective on and from 24 October 1996. Special Gazette No. 395 refers.

Should you have any queries regarding the controls on ""Fantasy"", please contact Gary Morris, Department of
Health and Family Services, Canberra on 06 2897277. Enquiries regarding this Australian Customs Notice can be

OPTIONAL PORT OF PAYMENT FOR COMPILE CASH

ENTRIES

The Australian Customs Service (ACS) has recently reviewed the policy on payment of COMPILE CASH entries.

At the time when Optional Port of Lodgement (OPL) was introduced there was a distinction made regarding the
payment of OPL entries. COMPILE EFT entries were able to be paid from any site Australia wide while COMPILE
CASH entries were required to be paid at the Port of Discharge.

A number of recent instances have prompted the ACS to review the treatment of COMPILE CASH entries where
the port of payment will be treated the same as COMPILE EFT entries for clearance purposes. Manual entries
will however need to be paid at the Port of Discharge in line with current agreed practices.

As of 25 November 1996 allCOMPILE entries (EFT and CASH) will be able to be paid at any port Australia wide.

CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION - IMPORT STATISTICAL CODES

In May 1994, Australia ratified a new international treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical
weapons. It sets up requirements for reporting by contracting parties of activities relevant to the objects of the Convention, and for verification of these activities by an international
inspectorate. The CWC will enter into force on 29 April 1997 and preparations are currently being made for its implementation in Australia.

The World Customs Organization (WCO) has been requested to prepare changes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HCDCS), so that CWC scheduled
chemicals are more clearly identifiable. It appears that the changes to the HCDCS will not take place before 2000. At the WCO 87/88 session in June 1996, member administrations and
contracting parties to the HCDCS agreed to a recommended to take all appropriate action to insert additional subdivisions in their statistical nomenclatures.

On 1 January 1997, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) will introduce a number of new statistical codes to capture data on the imports of certain chemicals. This is being done at
the request of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to meet Australia's international obligations under the CWC.

The normal ABS response to commercial and legislative requests for new statistical codes is to survey importers, exporters, their Customs brokers and agents to ensure proposals are
workable. This course of action has been followed with the more complex proposals stemming from the CWC.

However, bearing in mind Australia's international obligations, and to a lesser extent, the cost associated with surveys, the ABS did not canvas the more straightforward proposals, eg.

Customs Tariff Item/Statistical Code 2811.19.00/03 is currently used to record imports of sundry inorganic acids, amongst which is hydrocycanic acid. It is proposed to replace this TI/SC
with 2811.19.00/38 (to collect solely hydrocycanic acid, which is scheduled) and 2811.19.00/39 (to collect other acids which are not scheduled).

A list of the affected statistical codes and their survey status appears on the attachment. The Australian Customs Service will dispatch appropriate Tariff Reprint pages from Canberra on

AMENDMENT TO THE CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED EXPORT)

REGULATIONS TO REPEAL REGULATION 13CC (EXPORT OF

GOODS OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL

REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA)

In June 1992, the Customs (Prohibited Export) Regulations (the Regulations) were amended to insert Regulation
13CC in order to implement United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions imposing economic and trade
sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (FRY). Statutory Rule 1992 No.
155 and Australian Customs Notice (ACN) 92/104 refers.

In May 1993, the Regulations were further amended to insert Regulation 13CD to extend the sanctions to the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia. Statutory Rule 1993 No. 68 and ACN 93/81
refers.

Regulations 13CC and 13CD prohibited the exportation of all goods the immediate or final destination of which
was, or was intended to be, one of the abovementioned Republics without the written permission of the Minister
for Foreign Affairs or an authorised person.

In December 1995, in accordance with UNSC Resolution 1022 of 22 November 1995, the sanctions in relation to
the FRY, the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were suspended indefinitely,
except insofar as they related to the Bosnian Serb party and the foreign assets of the FRY. The suspension was
achieved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade issuing a general permission under the relevant regulations
which allowed:

the exportation from Australia of all goods except those goods:
(i) the immediate or final destination of which was intended to be a Bosnian Serb controlled area of Bosnia and
Herzegovina;

or

(ii) that were owned or controlled by the FRY or a public utility of that country.

On 29 February 1996, the Secretary-General of NATO advised the UN that the Bosnian Serb forces had
withdrawn from the zones of separation set out in the Dayton Peace Agreement, thereby satisfying the
requirements of UNSC Resolution 1022 for suspension of the remaining sanctions against the Bosnian Serb
Party. The obligation on Australia of this suspension was that only the exportation from Australia of goods ""owned
or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the FRY or a public utility of the FRY"" was to be controlled. Regulation 13CC
was amended to reflect this outcome and Regulation 13CD was repealed. Statutory Rule 1996 No. 32 and ACN
95/65 refers.

On 1 October 1996, the UNSC decided in Resolution 1074 that the remaining sanctions should be terminated.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade therefore requested that the Customs (Prohibited Export) Regulations
be amended to repeal Regulation 13CC to give effect to Resolution 1074. This amendment became effective on
12 December 1996 by Statutory Rule 1996 No. 282.

This last amendment means that there are no prohibitions on goods being exported to the FRY.

SYDNEY 2000 GAMES (INDICIA AND IMAGES) PROTECTION

ACT 1996

Introduction

This is a guide to the operation of the Customs seizure provisions of the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and
Images) Protection Act 1996 (the Act) and is intended for the owners and licensed users of the Sydney 2000
Games indicia and images. The Act came into effect on 28 June 1996 and ceases on 31 December 2000.

The Act establishes a legislative scheme to permit the owner of material bearing the Sydney 2000 Games indicia
and/or images, or an exclusive licensee, to object to the importation of goods which allegedly infringe their usage
of these indicia and/or images for commercial purposes. It is recommended that persons considering lodgement
of a Notice of Objection discuss the matter with their legal advisers before proceeding with the Notice.

The purpose of the Act is to assist in preserving the financial integrity of the Sydney 2000 Olympic and
Paralympic Games by facilitating the raising of licensing revenue for the Games through the protection of the use
of the indicia and images associated with the Sydney Games.

Preservation of this revenue is fundamental in achieving a good financial outcome for the Games whilst ensuring
a limited call on the national public purse. The Olympics, whilst based in Sydney, is an Australian event and is
funded by both major sponsors and royalty payments that will come from the sale of authorized merchandise after
1 January 1997.

Customs is working closely with the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and the
Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC) and will ensure that only authorized licence holders are able
to import merchandise with the approved logos and associated markings.

1. Outline

Section 32 of the Act establishes a scheme to be able to lodge a Notice of Objection in respect of these goods
and Section 33 of the Act empowers Customs to seize such goods pending resolution of an action brought by the
Objector as to whether the importation of the goods infringes notified indicia and/or images.

2. The Legislative Scheme - Seizure Provisions

Section 33 provides that where:

(a) goods manufactured outside Australia have been imported into Australia and are subject to the control of
Customs; and

(b) the imported goods have had applied to them Sydney 2000 Games indicia and/or images; and

(c) there has been given to Customs, a Notice in writing objecting to the importation of goods that have applied to

(d) the goods, in the opinion of Customs, have applied to them Sydney 2000 Games indicia and/or images that
the designated owner is not authorised by, or licensed under, the Act to use for commercial purposes in relation to
the goods;

then Customs must seize the imported goods unless there are reasonable grounds for believing:

the Sydney 2000 Games indicia and/or images (refer section 12 of the Act)would not be contravened by the
use by the designated owner of the indicia and/or images for commercial purposes; or
the Objector, or one or more of the objectors, has not provided sufficient security to reimburse the
Commonwealth in respect of expenses that may be incurred by the Commonwealth if the goods were seized.

The legislative scheme does not provide for seizure of goods which are imported for the personal use of the
importer and are not intended to be dealt with or provided for commercial purposes (refer section 11 of the Act). It
also does not empower Customs to take seizure action on its own behalf.

DRAWBACKS ELECTRONIC DATA INPUT PROJECT 1996-

1997

The Cargo Automation Development Fund (CADF) committee recently approved the development and
implementation of an Electronic Data Input (EDI) front-end to the current Drawback system.

The new EDI Drawback system will replace the current manual Drawback application process and provide an
efficient, secure and cost-effective procedure by which clients may claim drawback. It is anticipated that the
introduction of EDI Drawbacks will:

provide easier access for clients to make drawback claims;
reduce the reliance of clients on paper claims and associated correspondence;
provide immediate response to claim status queries; and
reduce the turnaround time for the payment of claims.

Members of peak industry bodies, dedicated information technology service providers and large drawback clients
will be invited to provide input into the development and trial stages of the EDI Drawback system. Clients will
have the flexibility to develop a drawback module to enable them to interface with their existing inhouse system,
or to select from a range of dedicated software providers.

Seminars are planned to be held in Sydney and Melbourne in approximately March/April 1997, to give clients and
interested parties the opportunity to discuss the project with Customs. Venues, dates and scheduled times of
these seminars will be advised at a later date.

Any enquiries concerning EDI Drawbacks may be directed to Mr Mike Henry in Canberra on (06) 275 6502.

OIL AND GAS SEARCH CONCESSION - ITEM 22

The purpose of this Notice is to assist importers and their representatives to correctly enter goods under Item 22
of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995.

This concession is intended to assist the petroleum industry by reducing the costs of certain goods imported for
use directly in connection with the exploration for and discovery of oil and gas deposits and the pre-production
development of wells on those sites provided substitutable goods are not available from Australian manufacture.

The terms of Item 22 provide for the duty free entry of: ""Goods, as prescribed by by-law, as follows:

(a) that are for use in connection with the exploration for petroleum or natural gas; or

(b) that are for use in connection with the development of petroleum or natural gas wells to the stage where a
well-head assembly is attached, other than goods for, or for use in connection with, controlling, treating,
conveying or storing petroleum or natural gas after leaving the well-head assembly, other than goods in respect of
which substitutable goods are produced in Australia or are capable of being produced in Australia by any person
in the ordinary course of business"".

Development restrictions

The restriction in Item 22 to goods used in the development of petroleum or natural gas wells ""to the stage where
a well-head assembly is attached"" refers to the point in time immediately following the attachment of the last
flange before the christmas tree. It does not refer to the physical location of the well head assembly atop the well
as it is intended to exclude further exploration and development activity which occurs after the well head
assembly is first attached. This reflects the policy that this concession was only to apply to goods used in
exploration and pre-production development activities. Goods imported for 'workovers' are ineligible for entry
under Item 22, whether or not the well was previously productive.

Goods that are for use in connection with the development of petroleum or natural gas wells, and which are also
for, or for use in connection with, controlling, treating, conveying or storing petroleum or natural gas after leaving
the well-head assembly, are also excluded from the terms of this item.
Page 2

Substitutable Goods

Before utilising Item 22 importers should have evidence that, at the time of entry for home consumption,
substitutable goods are not produced, or are not capable of being produced, in Australia by any person in the
ordinary course of business, in terms of Part XVA of the Customs Act 1901 and may take the form of:

a Tariff Concession Order (TCO) in force at the time of entry for home consumption, or
a letter from a prescribed organisation (under Part XVA of the Customs Act 1901), such as the Industrial
Supplies Office Network (ISONET), or
a letter from a relevant industry association, or
a letter from a Chamber of Manufactures or similar body to the same effect.

This is because Subsection 3(1) of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 provides that the expressions 'substitutable
goods', 'produced in Australia', and 'in the ordinary course of business' have the same meanings as in Part XVA
of the Customs Act 1901, relating to TCOs.

In any other case, the matter should be referred to the Director Policy By-laws.

Due to the time needed to gain a TCO or to acquire sufficient evidence showing that Australian manufacturers
were given genuine opportunities to supply, it is recommended that potential users of Item 22 take steps to
ensure substitutable goods are not available from Australian manufacture early in the procurement process.

By-law

In addition to meeting the terms of Item 22, goods entered under this concession must also satisfy the terms of
the by-law prescribed to Item 22, currently Customs By-law (BL) Number 9640057. This by-law requires the
goods to be used directly in connection with exploration or development (it would not, for example, include goods

REFUND CIRCUMSTANCE 126(1)(EA)

This notice is to advise a change in policy relating to refunds payable under r.126(1)(ea) of the Customs
Regulations.

Where a decision has been handed down by either the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) or a Court on
appeal from the AAT, an applicant is not required to make application for a refund under the Customs Regulations
(r.128(2)). This has led to some confusion in the past as to the proper procedure for applying for a refund of duty
in this circumstance.

From 1 January 1997, the Australian Customs Service (ACS) will ensure that refunds which are due as a result of
a decision of the AAT or a Court on appeal from the Tribunal will be paid promptly without application to the
parties involved in the dispute. There will be no facility in the COMPILE system to create a refund application.

A refund nominated in the dispute will be paid in accordance with the details submitted on the original refund

INDEXATION OF CERTAIN EXCISE AND CUSTOMS TARIFF RATES AND THE DIESEL FUEL

REBATE

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of Excise and Customs duties on spirits, beer, tobacco
and petroleum products will change on and from 3 February 1997. Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment provide the new rates.

For this indexation, the provisions require that the December 1996 index number published by the Australian Statistician is to be divided by the previous highest December
or June index number to determine the factor used to index the rates of duty. Accordingly, the December 1996 number (120.3) has been divided by the June 1996 number
(119.8) to establish the indexation factor of 1.004.

Changes have also been made to the diesel fuel rebate rates declared in accordance with sub-section 78A(5A) of the Excise Act 1901 and sub-section 164(5A) of the
Customs Act 1901. The new rates of diesel fuel rebate are declared on and from 3 February 1997 and are listed in Tables 3 and 4 in the Attachment.

Applicants for diesel fuel rebate are advised that the change to the declared rates will not affect the rate of rebate payable during February 1997.

Sub-sections 164(5AA) of the Customs Act and 78A(5AA) of the Excise Act determine the rate payable in respect of eligible diesel fuel. This rate is the average of the rates
of rebate, declared by the Minister, which were in force on the last day of each of the 6 months immediately before the month in which the application for rebate was
received by a Regional Director of Customs.

This average rate can change from month to month and the rate applicable to a particular claim is shown on the payment advice forwarded to applicants.

COST RECOVERY IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE

1. Introduction

The Import Processing Charges Bill 1996, Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 and the Customs Depot
Licensing Charges Bill 1996 provide the legislative framework for the Customs Cost Recovery System which was
announced by the Government in the 1996/97 Budget. All three bills are scheduled for debate in the Senate early
in the Autumn Sittings which begin on 4 February 1997 and are proposed for commencement by Proclamation on
1 April 1997.

This notice contains information in relation to depots and the entry threshold limit for commercial importations by
post.

2. Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill 1996

The Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill 1996 (""the Bill"") is one of three bills in the legislative package
associated with the cost recovery regime for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service.
The Bill covers charges associated with the new depot licensing regime for existing s.17(b) premises.

Following the introduction of the Bill into Parliament in November 1996, the Government will move an amendment
to provide a two tiered annual licence fee system to replace the proposed flat $4,000 annual fee for depot
licences. The tiered system will be based upon the number of transactions handled by licensed depots and is
intended to introduce a lower annual licence charge for those small volume depots, many of which are located in
the smaller states or in regional centres. Depots which handled 100 or more transactions for the previous relevant
twelve months will be subject to an annual fee of $4,000, while those depots which handled less than 100
transactions for the previous relevant twelve months will be subject to an annual fee of $1,500.

3. Definitions and Determination of the Number of Transactions

The revised licensing system has led to a need to clearly define certain terms, in particular line of cargo and
transactions handled. These terms are relevant to the determination of the volume of cargo entering a depot and
the consequent fee which will apply.

Line of Cargo has the same broad definition as in the Import Charges Bill 1996, ie: ""cargo covered by that part of
an electronic or documentary cargo report that constitutes a reference to:

(a) a single air waybill or similar document; or (b) a single bill of lading or similar document.""

Transactions Handled [in relation to a licensed depot for a defined period] means lines of cargo received into that
place during that period.

The revised licensing system is to be effective from 1 April 1997. The period for determining lines of cargo into a
depot is set for the 12 months ended 31 March each year. For depots currently appointed under s.17(b), the
period for determining the record of receipts of lines of cargo entering the depot will be the 12 month period
immediately prior to the date of effect of the licence -
ie: 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997.

Depots which are determined to have received 100 or more lines of cargo in the period from 1 April 1996 to 31
March 1997 (and which operated continuously for that period) will be liable for a licence fee of $5,000. This is a
combination of the $4,000 fee for 1997/98 and the quarter-year fee for the period 1 April 1997 to 30 June 1997.
Similarly, for depots with less than 100 lines of cargo in that period, the licence fee will be $1,875, being $1,500
for 1997/98 and $375 for the quarter 1 April 1997 to 30 June 1997.

Section 17(b) depots which came into operation during the period 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997, a pro rata
apportionment will apply for the calculation of the annual number of transactions handled to determine whether
the $4,000 annual fee or the $1,500 annual fee is applicable. For new depots, the licence fee will be $4,000 for
the first year of operation as there will be no basis for calculating the actual volume of transactions handled.
However, it should be noted that the initial fee is subject to review after 12 months operation based on transaction
throughput.

NOTICE OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS ACT 1995

The company referred to in the attached Schedule has given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which
have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, this Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two years from the
commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the
contrary, the particular trade marks relate to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard
to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly indicates where
that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice regarding the coverage of the Notices of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance
with the final paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade marks they
are liable to be seized by Customs, unless it can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or

- the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed
where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs,
or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an
infringement of"" a trade mark. The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish to initiate negotiations regarding use of the
trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notice of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further
information regarding the Notice of Objection, or Customs' role in regard to this Notice, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs Service
Office in their nearest capital city (see Attachment A).

IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES

In the August 1996 Budget, the Government announced charges that would apply to certain Customs commercial activities (referACN 96/44 - 23 September 1996). The legislation
required to introduce the charges has now been passed and the charges will apply from 1 April 1997.

The charges are shown on the following page. These charges have been subject to minor amendments since initial notification in ACN 96/44.

Some arrangements have also been amended, as foreshadowed in ACN 97/11 of February 1997.

Depot Licensing Arrangements

A two-tier structure for depot licensing will be implemented from 1 April 1997.

Commercial Entry Threshold at the Post

There will be a 12 month delay in implementing the reduction of the commercial entry threshold from $1000 to $250 at the Post. From 1 April 1998 it will be necessary to lodge a formal

MANUAL REPORTING CHARGE - SEA CARGO

PROCEDURES

This notice is to advise Customs' clients of the procedures for assessment and payment of sea cargo manual
reporting charges commencing on 1 April, 1997.

The notice will be of interest to shipping companies and freight forwarders who report sea cargo manually to
Customs.

APPLICATION OF CHARGES

The sea cargo manual reporting charge is $2.60 for each lowest level bill of lading reported manually and will be
levied against cargo reporters.

The manual reporting charge does not apply to electronic sea cargo reporters submitting cargo reports in Sea
Cargo Automation (SCA).

CHARGE COLLECTION PROCEDURES

The following procedures will be adopted nationally from 1 April 1997. To facilitate the introduction of the new
procedures, a trial will be conducted from 3 March 1997 until 14 March, 1997. Customs Officers will introduce
manual cargo reporters to the new forms and procedures during this period.

The cargo reporter will submit Parts 1, 2 and 3 of Form 1, forty eight hours prior to vessel arrival.
The cargo reporter will present a completed Documentary Sea Cargo Report Charge Assessment Notice to
the Cashier with the Form 1, Part 2 for payment. The Cashier will accept payment for the amount assessed in
the notice and issue a receipt. In district offices without cashier facilities Customs Officers will collect charges
on presentation of Form 1
The Cashier will endorse the receipt number on all copies of the Documentary Sea Cargo Report Charge
Assessment Notice and retain one copy.
The cargo reporter will then present the Form 1, parts 1, 2 and 3, with the original and second copy of the
Documentary Sea Cargo Report Charge Assessment Notice and the Cashiers receipt, to the Customs Officer.
The original Documentary Sea Cargo Report Charge Assessment Notice will be retained with the manifest by
Customs.
The Form 1 details will then be screened in accordance with existing procedures.

Cargo reporters are reminded that:

Principal agents reporting manually must provide a full container discharge list (Form 1, Part 1) to Customs.
This will allow reconciliation of electronic and manual reports for the vessel.
Manual additions to a manifest (eg. surplus goods) must be reported on the Form 1. The process of lodgement
will then include the above charge collection procedures.
The Form 1 presented to Customs must include a report of breakbulk cargo.

MANUAL REPORTING CHARGE AND SCREENING CHARGE

FOR AIR CARGO NOT REQUIRING AN IMPORT ENTRY - AIR

CARGO PROCEDURES

This notice is to advise Customs' clients of the procedures for assessment and payment of air cargo manual
reporting charges and screening charges for air cargo not requiring an import entry. These charges will
commence on 1 April 1997.

This notice will be of interest to cargo terminal operators (CTOs), cargo reporters, cargo depots and Customs
Brokers who report air cargo manually to Customs.

APPLICATION OF CHARGES

The relevant charges are:

$3.00 for each single air waybill reported manually; and
$2.40 for each single air waybill, for air cargo not requiring an import entry (screened free);

and will be paid by the lowest level depot at the destination airport.

These charges do not apply to:

electronic reports reverted to manual by Customs Officers;
master air waybill and sub-master air waybill consolidations with no house air waybills reported;
transhipment cargo; and
diplomatic consignments.

For electronic air cargo reporters, submitting cargo reports in Air Cargo Automation (ACA), the screening charge
will be automatically counted and settled by invoice on a monthly basis. The manual reporting charge does not
apply to finalised electronic cargo reports.

Customs is encouraging manual air cargo reporters to enter into a periodic settlement agreement whereby both
charges will be paid monthly. Otherwise, charges must be paid by manual air cargo reporters prior to the release
of documents. These agreements will be made available in Customs Information Centres by early March.

CHARGE COLLECTION PROCEDURES

The following procedures will be adopted nationally from 1 April 1997. To facilitate the introduction of the new
procedures, a trial will be conducted from 3 March 1997 until 14 March, 1997. Customs will introduce manual
cargo reporters to the new forms and procedures during this period.

Procedures for Manual Air Cargo Reporting

The cargo terminal operator (CTO) will deliver all manual master consolidations to Customs on flight arrival.
Customs will wait three hours after flight arrival at the destination airport allowing an opportunity for all ACA
reports to be captured.
Customs will then assess air waybill details and air waybills will be perforated and counted for each cargo
reporter/depot.
A Documentary Air Cargo Report Charge Assessment Notice will then be prepared by Customs incorporating
the number of single air waybills reported manually and the number of air cargo reports not requiring an import
entry (screened free) for that cargo reporter/depot.
The original and two duplicates of the Documentary Air Cargo Report Charge Assessment Notice will be
attached to the cargo reporter's/depot's master or sub-master air waybill as applicable.
Where a monthly settlement agreement has been provided by the cargo reporter/depot the air waybills will be
collected by the cargo reporter/depot from Customs (returned to the CTO in the case of Australian Air Express
clients). Where periodic settlement has not been arranged, the charges set out on the Documentary Air Cargo
Report Charge Assessment Notice must be paid to the Cashier prior to the release of documents. A receipt
will be issued.

EXCISE TARIFF ACT 1921 - SPIRITUOUS BEVERAGES

Following the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the matter of Carlton and United Breweries and the CEO of Customs, there has been some uncertainty as to the ambit of
sub-item 2(H) of the Excise Tariff Act 1921.

So as to remove this uncertainty a Notice of Intention to propose an Excise Tariff alteration in accordance with section 160B of the Excise Act 1901 was published in Special
Commonwealth Gazette No. S41 on 3 February 1997. The proposed alteration took effect on and from that date in accordance with section 160B.

The Gazette Notice amends the Schedule to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to:

(i) delete all references to ""spirituous beverage"" in the Schedule and Item 2; and

(ii) substitute a new item 2 to ensure that excise duty continues to be imposed on all spirits and beverages containing distilled alcohol. In particular, new sub-item 2(H) makes excisable
all beverages containing distilled alcohol, n.e.i., regardless of the alcohol content.

As was the case prior to the Notice, fortified wines and fortified wine based beverages are not subject to excise duty. However, if spirit is added to a fortified wine then the added spirit will
be liable for the relevant duty.

It should also be noted that pre-mixed beverages containing brandy are now subject to excise duty on the brandy content at the excise rate for brandy, currently $31.59 per litre of
distilled alcohol. This changes the previous arrangement where pre-mixed beverages containing brandy paid the general spirit excise duty rate (currently $36.99 per litre of distilled
alcohol).

When preparing Excise entries (Nature 40) for pre-mixed beverages containing brandy, the relevant excise duty rate will be applied under Excise Tariff Item 2H, Stat. Code 63 by
inserting in the Additional Information Field on the entry - 'Additional Tariff Item 2A'.

To assist in the preparation of entries, listed below are the new Excise Tariff sub-items 2G, 2H and 2O and the new Statistical Codes allocated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
There are no changes to the other sub-items or statistical codes in Item 2.

DRAWBACK OF DUMPING AND COUNTERVAILING DUTY

On 24 December 1996 the Customs Regulations were amended to expressly provide for applicants to claim
drawback on duties payable under the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975.

The amendments provide for drawback claims on goods exported from 24 December 1996.

Applicants are advised that the usual requirement of pre-export notification on goods exported between 1 July
1996 and 24 December 1996 will not be necessary as refund provisions apply to these goods. Sub-regulation 128
B (6) ensures that the amount of a refund that can be paid under new paragraph 126 (1) (w) is the amount of
drawback that would have been payable under the regulations if the drawback provisions applying to dumping
duties had been in force when the goods were exported.

The conditions that currently apply to drawback on import duties will apply to drawback claims after the 24
December 1996.

INWARD REPORTING OF FEEDERPORT SEA CARGO

This notice is to advise shipping companies, freight forwarders and regional Customs officers of amendment to
the arrangements which govern the report and underbond movement of feederport sea cargo containers. These
arrangements replace those announced in Australian Customs Notice 94/56.

2. From 1 February 1997, the feederport container reporting and movement situations set out below, will be dealt
with in the described manner. It should be noted that, sea cargo automation (SCA) vessels are those that are
managed by a principal agent (shipping company) that is connected to the SCA system. Manual vessels are
those remaining vessels which are managed by a principal agent that is not connected to the SCA system.

SCA VESSELS

3. For feederport movements from an SCA vessel, the following cargo reporting and underbond arrangements will
apply:

(a) When a SCA cargo report is transmitted to Customs by a principal agent, slot charterer or freight forwarder :-

no documentary report or movement authorisation is required [correct discharge port must be embedded in the
report].

(b) When a documentary freight forwarder is nominated as the cargo reporter on a shipping company's FAK
(freight all kinds and lesser container loads) summary and that shipping company has transmitted an
electronic SCA underbond movement application:-

a documentary cargo report (Form 1) must be submitted to Customs IN THE PORT OF DESTINATION by the
freight forwarder who is nominated as the cargo reporter on the shipping company's FAK summary.

(c) When a documentary freight forwarder is nominated as the cargo reporter on a shipping company's FAK
summary and that shipping company has not transmitted an electronic SCA underbond movement application:-

a documentary cargo report (Form 1) must be submitted to Customs in the PORT OF DESTINATION by the
freight forwarder nominated as the cargo reporter on the shipping company's FAK summary; and

a B200 underbond movement application must also be submitted with the Form 1 in the PORT OF
DESTINATION by the freight forwarder.

(d) When a documentary freight forwarder is nominated as the cargo reporter on a documentary shipping
company's Form 1, part 3 :-

a documentary cargo report (Form 1) must be submitted to Customs in the PORT OF DESTINATION by the
freight forwarder nominated as the cargo reporter on the shipping company's Form 1, part 3; and

a B200 underbond movement application must also be submitted with the Form 1 in the PORT OF
DESTINATION by the freight forwarder.

MANUAL VESSELS

4. For feederport movement from a manual vessel the following cargo reporting and underbond arrangements will
apply:

(a) When a documentary principal agent is the cargo reporter :-

a documentary cargo report (Form 1) must be submitted to Customs in the PORT OF DISCHARGE by the
principal agent;

a B200 underbond movement application must also be submitted with manifest page in the PORT OF

FASTER REFUND PAYMENTS

From 5 March 1997, approved applicants for entry refunds will benefit from a new Customs arrangement aimed at

Under the new system, entry payments will be made daily rather than weekly, reducing the time taken from

Currently, entry refund payments are transferred weekly into applicant's accounts and occasional delays resulted
from the payment approval cut-off dates.

As part of the continual process to improve the integrity of the data contained in the Australian Customs Service

of unit values. The edit will apply to all COMPILE entries including Post Warrant Amendments (PWA's).

Put simply, the new edit means that high and low unit values will be input against all statistical codes in the

present).

When a user creates an entry and the unit value is outside the high / low range, the following error message will

if a particular Tariff Statistical code has a high unit value of 50 and a low unit value of 5, the error will occur if the
unit value is outside that range. If the price or quantity input on the line of the entry is correct but outside the
range, the user confirms that the information is correct or ;

if a mistake has been made, the user makes the appropriate amendment.

In both cases the Alter command must be used. This can prevent simple typing errors by users when creating
COMPILE entries.

The unit values can be displayed using the Detailed Tariff Stats. display screen, option 2 of the Tariff Stats.
Display menu (option 17 of Reference Files). EDIFICE users will have the unit value information supplied to them
with the usual Reference File updates.

The Unit Value edit will become operative on and from Saturday, 22 March 1997. Any problems with entry
processing should be directed to the User Liaison area in your region.

REMOVAL OF EXPORT CONTROLS ON SCHEDULE 7 ITEMS

OF THE CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED EXPORTS) REGULATIONS

Regulation 9 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations controls the exportation of those commodities
listed in Schedule 7 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Schedule 7 goods cover: alumina, bauxite,
coal, mineral sands (ilmenite, upgraded ilmenite or synthetic rutile, leucoxene, monazite, rutile, xenotime and
zircon) and liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The exportation of Schedule 7 commodities is prohibited unless a permission in writing to export has been
granted by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy or an authorised person.

Statutory Rules Nos 30-33 notified in Special Gazette of 6 March 1997, amended the Customs (Prohibited
Exports) Regulations to remove the export controls on the above commodities. Export controls will however
remain on monazite and xenotime under Regulation 11, Schedule 9 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports)
Regulations, as these materials have low level radioactive content.

Exporters of alumina, bauxite, coal, mineral sands and LNG should note that for the purposes of ACS export
documentation, they are no longer required to quote a permit number on export entries.

Any enquiries concerning these amendments should be directed to the Department of Primary Industries and
Energy, as follows:

Tom Keating (coal) - Canberra (06) 272 5739

CUSTOMS OFFICER MAGAZINE

Customs has had a number of reports of advertising sales people contacting a number of Australian Customs
Service clients soliciting for advertising in a magazine called the Customs Officer.

It should be noted that this publication, published on behalf of the Customs Officers Association of Australia, has
no connection with, nor is endorsed by, the Australian Customs Service.

A number of Customs officers are members of the COA. However, the organisation has no present capacity to
represent Customs officers in industrial matters.

Some people who have been asked to place advertising in the magazine have indicated that the advertising sales
people have implied that placing an advertisement in the publication will have some bearing on the company's
future dealings with Customs.

Customs wishes to make it quite clear that it treats all persons with whom it deals on equal terms. Any suggestion
that persons who subscribe to the Customs Officer or any other publication as advertisers or otherwise will obtain
preferential treatment from Customs is false and misleading.

NOTICE OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule
which have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force for a period of two years
from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to
the contrary, the particular trade marks relate to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in
regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice regarding the coverage of the Notices of Objection from their local Customs
office (in accordance with the final paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade marks
they are liable to be seized by Customs, unless it can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or

- the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed
where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from
Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar
to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark. The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish to initiate negotiations
regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further
information regarding the Notice of Objection, or Customs' role in regard to this Notice, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs
Service Office in their nearest capital city.

RETURNS UNDER SECTIONS 69 AND 70 OF THE CUSTOMS

ACT 1901

Cost Recovery Charges

This notice applies to clients who obtain permission to deliver goods into home consumption under sections 69
and 70 of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act) without lodging an entry under section 71A of the Customs
Act.

Section 69 - Like Customable Goods

Section 69 permissions to deliver like customable goods into home consumption without entry are subject to 2
major conditions:

1. the goods must first be entered for warehousing on a Nature 20 entry; and
2. the permission holder must give Customs a return providing particulars in relation to the goods at such periods
as are specified in the permission (a Nature 30 approved form or approved statement is used to lodge the
return).

The import processing charges legislation presently does not impose the warehoused goods entry fee to the
Nature 30 returns lodged under section 69. Therefore, until the legislation is amended, section 69 permission
holders are not required to pay the warehoused goods entry fee in respect of Nature 30 returns. The relevant
entry processing charge on the Nature 20 entry into the warehouse will be payable at the time the entry is
processed.

Changes in the COMPILE system (for electronically lodged returns) and the Customs Cashier system (for
manually lodged returns) will ensure that the warehoused goods entry fee is not applied to section 69 Nature 30
returns until amending legislation has been passed.

The existing fee for section 69 returns in paragraph 52(1)(b) of the Customs Regulations will be repealed with
effect from 1 April 1997.

Section 70 - Special Clearance Goods

Permissions granted under section 70 of the Customs Act to deliver goods into home consumption without entry
as special clearance goods are subject to the condition that the permission holder must give Customs a return,
within 7 days of the delivery of the goods, providing particulars in relation to the goods. Section 70 returns are
lodged manually or electronically in the relevant Nature 10 or Nature 30 approved form or approved statement.

The import processing charges legislation presently does not impose the entry processing charge and the
warehoused goods entry fee to returns lodged under section 70. Therefore, until the legislation is amended,
section 70 permission holders are not required to pay the entry processing charge in respect of Nature 10 returns
or the warehoused goods entry fee in respect of Nature 30 returns.

The COMPILE system does not distinguish between electronic Nature 10 and 30 returns under section 70 and
normal nature 10 and 30 entries. Therefore clients are asked to submit a written application for a refund of entry
processing charge or warehoused goods entry fee setting out:

(a) the Special Clearance Application number;

(b) the date and time of lodging the application;

and

(c) the relevant entry number(s) that COMPILE has allocated to the returns to which
the refund application relates.

CHANGES TO AIR CARGO REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS

This notice is to advise air cargo terminal operators (CTOs), air cargo depots, air freight forwarders and interested
brokers of changes to the air cargo reporting arrangements.

From 7 April 1997, the post arrival three hour ""revert to manual"" mechanism will be removed from the air cargo
automation (ACA) system. To complement this change CTOs will be authorised to release consolidation
documentation directly to the appropriate freight forwarder.

The changes to current practice outlined are a further step toward full electronic air cargo reporting and will be
implemented in conjunction with a number of nationally agreed operating principles, listed below. These principles
have been endorsed by the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, the
Australian Air Transport Association, independent CTOs, the Australian Federation of International Forwarders,
the International Air Courier Association of Australian and the Customs Brokers Council of Australia.

all master air waybills will be reported electronically by CTOs;
all electronically capable depots will report cargo via the ACA system;
all consolidations consigned to non depot freight forwarders will be reported by the deconsolidating depot or
by the freight forwarder through an electronic alternative.

The current changes, when combined with some minor ACA enhancements and the new depot licensing
provisions of Section 77, are designed to realise an entirely electronic reporting and screening air cargo
environment by 30 June, 1997.

It should be noted that the above change in practice does not alter the cargo reporter's responsibility under
Section 64 to provide timely cargo details to Customs. Should these changes result in a reduction in the
timeliness of cargo reporting, consideration will need to be given to appropriate remedial measures.

The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (""the Regulations"") have been amended to introduce controls on
the importation of disposable cigarette lighters. Statutory Rules 1997 No. 22, which was gazetted on 26 February
1997, includes new regulation 4S with effect from 1 March 1997.

Regulation 4S of the Regulations prohibits the importation into Australia of certain disposable and novelty
cigarette, cigar and pipe lighters which do not meet the construction and performance standards, including child
resistant features, set out in the Regulations. These standards are designed to complement those introduced
under the Trade Practices legislation (discussed below).

The importation of these lighters is prohibited unless the person importing the lighter has completed the required
statutory declaration under regulation 4S or a Ministerial permission has been granted by the Minister for Small
Business and Consumer Affairs.

There is an exception to the general prohibition on the importation of disposable cigarette lighters under
subregulation 4S(2) for persons who are 18 years of age or older and who are passengers on a ship or aircraft.
Such persons may import no more than five lighters at any one time.

1997.

1. By-Law 9740005 provides for passenger concessions previously covered by By-Law 9540004. It also allows

crew members to import alcoholic liquors and tobacco products every ten days in addition to importing clothing
and articles of personal hygiene upon entry into Australia subject to the conditions of the By-Law. Any other
concession related to this By-Law can only be taken by crew members who are ordinarily domiciled in
Australia once in a 12 month period.

2. By-Law 9740006 allows foreign crew members to import clothing and articles for personal hygiene subject to

ORGANISATIONS

S269FA of the Customs Act 1901 requires an applicant for a Tariff Concession Order (TCO) to satisfy the CEO
that there are reasonable grounds for asserting that a TCO application meets the core criteria because no
substitutable goods are produced in Australia. A person considering a TCO application may discharge the onus of
undertaking the research into possible substitutable goods production in Australia by obtaining advice from a
prescribed organisation.

Sections 269F and 269M of the Customs Act 1901 permit organisations to be prescribed for the purposes of the
Tariff Concessions Systems (TCS) in Part XVA of the Customs Act 1901. Until now, no such organisations have
been prescribed.

Customs Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rule 1997 No. 79 was gazetted on 14 April 1997 to insert new
regulation 179A in the Customs Regulations. The regulation lists the eight bodies making up the Industrial
Supplies Office (ISO) Network as prescribed organisations for the purposes of sections 269F and 269M.

The bodies forming the Industrial Supplies Office Network are:

NSW Industrial Supplies Office Ltd,
Industrial Supplies Office (Victoria) Ltd,
Industrial Supplies Office (Queensland) Ltd,
South Australian Industrial Supplies Office,
Industrial Supplies Office of Western Australia,
Industrial Supplies Office of Tasmania,
Northern Territory Industry Search and Opportunities Office and
ISONET Limited (Canberra)

The primary role of the ISO network is to promote the replacement of imports with Australian manufactured
goods, and the provision of advice for TCO applications is on a fee for service basis. In cases where ISO advice
leads a prospective TCO applicant to purchase the required goods from an Australian manufacturer, rather than
proceeding to import, the applicable fee may be refunded.

For contact with the ISO, refer to the details below.

For further information on the role and function of prescribed organisations contact B. Thomas (Customs) 06 275

EXCISE TARIFF ITEM 18 - OWNER FOR ENTRY PURPOSES

Excise Tariff Item 18 (ETI 18) provides for certain excisable goods to be delivered at a ""free"" rate of duty to sea-
going vessels of the Royal Australian Navy and Australian Military Forces where the vessels are in full
commission and where the goods are for consumption on board the eligible vessel.

Goods may only be delivered when a request for ETI 18 goods has been approved by Customs and provided to
the warehouse, excise manufacturer, providore or duty free shop as appropriate.

For entry purposes, the name of the eligible RAN or AMF vessel is to be shown as the ""owner"" of the goods. The
operator of the premises from which the goods are delivered is to retain a Customs approved copy of the order
signed by the ship's commander.

ETI 18 applies only to excisable goods of a type specified in the item.

1997/98 BUDGET - MEASURES TO ADDRESS REVENUE

LOSS TO THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE

SUBSTITUTION OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

As part of the 1997-98 Budget, the Government has announced that it will introduce legislation to combat the loss
of revenue resulting from the direct substitution of duty free or low duty petroleum products for products which
attract a rate of customs or excise duty commensurate with on-road use. For example, Customs is aware that
heating oil dutiable at 7.2 cents per litre has been substituted for automotive diesel dutiable at 34.697 cents per
litre although such action leads to engine damage. The Government's action also addresses:

continuing practices involving blending of products which are then used, or sold for use, as fuels but the
correct fuel duty is not paid; and
concern about market inequities and consumer protection and safety issues arising from substitution practices.

The proposed legislation will require the addition of chemical ""tracers"" to concessionally taxed petroleum
products. Both dyes and colourless markers are used successfully in many countries to allow authorities to trace
the use of concessional products and facilitate correct usage.

The Australian Customs Service is undertaking an intensive round of consultations with the petroleum industry
and other interested parties aimed at introducing the measures by 1 January 1998. The particular chemical
""tracers"" to be used will be determined following these consultations.

The legislation to be introduced will also correct some anomalies which potentially may be exploited to allow
some products which are currently not subject to the excise regime to be used for fuel purposes. New
arrangements are proposed regarding accounting for production of petroleum condensate and on-shore crude oil.

It is emphasised that the use of the chemical tracers does not have any impact on the Diesel Fuel Rebate
Scheme.

Customs has received advice that the United Nations Statistical Division has revised its classification of sheath
contraceptives (condoms) in the United Nations Classification by Broad Economic Categories (BEC), from
intermediate goods (processed industrial supplies) to non-durable consumer goods not elsewhere specified.

Accordingly, for Tariff Concession purposes, the table listing the Tariff classifications to which Item 50A of
Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff 1995 refers, is to be amended to include subheading 4014.10, in order to reflect
that sheath contraceptives are now classified as consumption goods and will attract a free rate of duty.

This decision is effective from 15 July 1996 and applications may be made for refund of duty under Customs
Regulation 126(1)(r).

COMPILE, TAPIN and the hardcopy Tariff pages are being amended to reflect that subheading 4014.10 now

1997/1998 BUDGET CHANGES AFFECTING SALES TAX

As part of the 1997/1998 Budget the Government announced that it is moving to remove an anomaly in the
wholesale sales tax system so that goods cannot be permanently imported sales tax free if they had previously
been temporarily imported sales tax free.

Wholesale sales tax applies to assessable sales of goods manufactured in Australia, or imported into Australia. A
good that has previously been used in Australia is not subject to sales tax.

Customs and sales tax law allows for exemption from Customs duty and sales tax for goods that are imported for
short periods. The special temporary importation provisions are intended to cover goods temporarily imported; for
example, by a visiting tourist or for an exhibition, promotion or other special event. Under these provisions, goods
can be imported for periods of less than twelve months free of Customs duty and sales tax provided a security or
undertaking is given.

There is evidence that these provisions have been used in an unintended manner. Goods have been imported for
a short period under the special temporary importation provisions. After being returned overseas, they have then
been reimported on a permanent basis free of sales tax because they have previously been used in Australia.

Requisite amendments to the sales tax law will soon be introduced into Parliament. When this occurs the
legislative change will take effect from 7.30 pm AEST, 13 May 1997. The Australian Taxation Office will not
enforce the collection of the Sales Tax owing until 28 days after the Bill receives Royal Assent but after that time
the legislation will retrospectively apply to all dealings with goods (including importation) from 13 May, 1997
onwards.

Owners of imported goods are advised that any interim claims for sales tax exempt status on the basis that the
goods had been used in Australia by a previous temporary importation will inevitably be countermanded by the
prospective sales tax legislation and that if they choose to claim the exemption then there will be the onus on
them to separately remit the tax payable 28 days after the Bill receives Royal Assent.

A further ACN will be issued advising of the passage of this amending legislation. Enquiries relating to this notice

NOTICE OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS ACT 1995

The company referred to in the attached Schedule has given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which
have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, this Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two years from the
commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 of the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to
the contrary, the particular trade mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in
regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs
office (in accordance with the final paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark
they are liable to be seized by Customs, unless it can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or

- the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed
where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from
Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar
to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark. The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish to initiate negotiations
regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notice of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further
information regarding the Notice of Objection, or Customs' role in regard to this Notice, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs
Service Office in their nearest capital city.

On 13 February 1997, as a result of an application lodged by ACI Fibreglass, Customs initiated an investigation
(ACDN No. 97/18) into the alleged dumping of gun rovings from the People's Republic of China and from Spain.

The goods were defined as 'E' glass rovings, designed for use with all types of 'spray-up', 'depositor' and
'chopper' guns in the fibreglass industry.

During the investigation, Customs found evidence that injury suffered by the Australian industry was not caused
by dumped imports from the nominated countries. ACI Fibreglass chose to withdraw its application.
Consequently, Customs will not be making a preliminary finding in this matter.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENT CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSAL No. 3 (1997)

On 13 December 1996, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. Tim Fischer MP. signed on behalf of Australia the Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information Technology
Products - The Information Technology Agreement (ITA). The ITA seeks the elimination of tariffs on computer technology and telecommunications products by the year 2000.

When negotiations were completed on 26 March 1997, the ITA had 41 member countries including our major APEC trading partners and the European Union. These countries account
for 92.3% of the estimated $750 billion annual trade in these products. Each participant agreed to undertake the necessary domestic procedures to fulfil their commitments for the ITA to
come into force on 1 July 1997.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1997) was introduced into the House of Representatives by the Minister Responsible for Customs, the Hon. Geoffrey Prosser MP. on 4 June 1997.

The Proposal implements Australia's tariff commitments under the ITA by providing either tariff splits with phasing rates of duty for specific goods covered by the ITA or by the addition of
phasing rates to existing tariff subheadings. Attachment ""A"" is a concordance of the subheadings which have been split with a brief description of the affected ITA goods. Attachment ""B""
is a list of subheadings which have been amended by the addition of phasing rates of duty.

Tariff reprint pages are being prepared and will be despatched to subscribers during the week commencing 16 June 1997.

Enquiries should be made in the first instance to Ray Banvill (06) 275 6516.

TARIFF CONCESSION ORDER IMPLICATIONS

A consequence of the ITA is a number of tariff changes in Chapters 84, 85 and 90. These changes will mean some 700 current TCO references will be affected and some will become
redundant from 30 June 1997.

As a result, a revocation/reissue exercise is currently being undertaken by the ACS to ensure all affected TCO references will be reissued with the appropriate amended tariff
classification on 1 July 1997.

Any enquiries regarding the TCO exercise should be directed to Ron Houston on (06) 275 6504.

CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSAL No. 4 (1997)

MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS TO THE CUSTOMS TARIFF

ACT 1995

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 4 (1997) was tabled in the House of Representatives on
4 June 1997 by the Minister Responsible for Customs, the Hon. Geoffrey Prosser MP.

This Proposal contains three changes, each of which is of a technical nature, and results from Administrative
Appeals Tribunal (AAT) decisions. The alterations are operative from 1 July 1997.

Surgical Drapes of Aseptic Paper

The description of goods in subparagraph (a) in subheading 4823.90.10 has been changed to read ""aseptic
paper, not including goods and/or articles of aseptic paper"". This change confirms the previous intent that only
aseptic paper and not goods of aseptic paper are classified in this subheading.

Lamps of Heading 9405

A recent AAT case determined that certain lamps were classified in Chapter 85. Australia is a contracting party to
the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System and must comply with classification rulings of the
World Customs Organization (WCO). The Australian Customs Service contacted the WCO who confirmed that
the goods in question were classified within heading 9405.

To clarify the classification of lamps a new Additional Note 2 has been inserted in Chapter 85.

Power Supply Units for Computers

In 1991, the AAT ruled that power supply units which are ""separately housed units, designed to be housed in the
same cabinet as the central processing unit"" should be classified in heading 8471 which had a Free rate of duty.
The ACS accepted this decision.

In 1996, the WCO recommended a number of classification changes, including one related to power supply units.
These reverted to subheading 8504.40. In the 1996 rewrite of the Customs Tariff, the WCO recommendation was
incorporated in a new tariff split 8504.40.10 with the transferred Free rate of duty.

The description of goods of the new subheading ""designed for use with equipment of 8471"" has proven to
encompass more goods than the AAT decision envisaged. A change to the description has been made to limit the
goods classified in 8504.40.10 to ""separately housed units, designed to be housed in the same cabinet as the
central processing unit of equipment of 8471"".

Tariff reprint pages are being prepared and will be despatched to subscribers during the week commencing 16
June 1997.

REVOCATION OF CERTAIN ITEM 47 BY-LAWS

A recent review of the Policy By-law items identified certain by-laws currently written to item 47 that do not meet the policy intent for that item and should be revoked.

Item 47 was introduced as part of the then Government's response to the Industries Assistance Commission's Report into the Mining, Construction and Agriculture Equipment Industries,
and was intended to only cover goods covered by that Report. The by-laws listed below do not meet this intent.

While revocation of by-laws is normally done immediately, it has been decided that, as these by-laws are linked to Tariff Concession Orders, a 28 day ""in transit"" period will be given to
allow goods in warehouse or on the water to be cleared using the by-laws.

Accordingly, by notice published in the Gazette of 11 June 1997, the by-laws were revoked, with a last operative day of 9 July 1997. A copy of the revocation notice is attached.

The by-laws involved are:

9040041

Transmission apparatus

9140010

Scanning receivers

TARIFF CONCESSION ORDERS (TCO) PASSENGER MOTOR VEHICLE PARTS / ""SUPER TOURING""
RACING CARS

Passenger Motor Vehicle Parts

The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon John Moore, has given approval for the re-instatement of concessional arrangements for certain passenger motor vehicle parts
and components that were covered by Commercial Tariff Concession Orders (CTCO) on 14 July 1996. Legislation to this effect was approved by Executive Council on 16 June 1997 and
was gazetted on 17 June 1997.

Subregulation 185 (2) has been amended to provide concessional entry for:

""passenger motor vehicle parts or components that, if they had been entered for home consumption on 14 July 1996, would have been the subject
of a Commercial Tariff Concession Order:

(i) having effect under Part XVA of the Act as continued in force by section 20 of the Customs Legislation (Tariff
Concessions and Anti-Dumping ) Amendment Act 1992;

and

(ii) that was in force on that date."" In an endeavour to resolve the situation as quickly as possible, Customs has
decided to deem new TCOs and accordingly, wordings similar to the CTCOs listed at the Attachment to this ACN
have been declared by the delegate of the CEO under section 269J of the Customs Act 1901, as goods in respect of
which a TCO should apply. The TCOs, if successful, will have an operative date of 17 June 1997.

The declarations will apply only to those tariff classifications in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff having a 15% general rate of duty. Other tariff classifications have been eligible for TCOs
from the date of revocation of the relevant CTCO.

CTCOs 9607752 and 9606819, which covered certain sound reproducers and certain transmission belts respectively, have not been included. It is considered that the goods are covered
by the broader terminology that is set out in other proposed replacement TCOs.

IMPORTATION OF MOTOR VEHICLES - PERMIT

ARRANGEMENTS

The provisions of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act (MVSA)1989 require that imported motor vehicles have a
Vehicle Import Approval (permit) from the Federal Office of Road Safety (FORS) before they can be imported into
Australia.

Where vehicles are not being cleared into home consumption (ie a Nature 10 entry), the MVSA impediment
requiring the production of a permit is currently attached to the warehousing (N20) entry. This sometimes causes
problems where permits are not received by importers at the time vehicles arrive in Australia. The vehicles cannot
be removed to bond while waiting the arrival of the permit.

To overcome this problem, it has been decided to move the impediment from the warehousing entry to the ex-
warehouse (N30) entry with effect from 1 July 1997. This will allow vehicles to be moved to bond pending the
issuing of a permit.

Warehouse operators will be responsible for ensuring that FORS permits are sighted prior to vehicles being
released from storage. To that end a copy of the permit will need to presented to the warehouse operator before a
vehicle can be released.

Any enquiries regarding this matter should be directed to Mr Wal Coggins in Canberra on 06 275 6566

NOTICE OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule
which have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force for a period of two years
from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to
the contrary, the particular trade marks relate to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in
regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice regarding the coverage of the Notices of Objection from their local Customs
office (in accordance with the final paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade marks
they are liable to be seized by Customs, unless it can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or

- the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed
where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from
Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar
to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark. The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish to initiate negotiations
regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further
information regarding the Notice of Objection, or Customs' role in regard to this Notice, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs
Service Office in their nearest capital city.

BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT ACT 1997 - ACT No. 105 of 1997

The Bounty Legislation Amendment Act 1997 received the Royal Assent on 30 June 1997 as Act No. 105 of 1997.

Act No. 105 of 1997 represents the Parliament's final position on the Government changes to Bounty schemes announced in the 1996-97 Budget on 20 August 1996. The Act, which
commenced on 30 June 1997, amends the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 and the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989.

The amendments implement the following changes to those Acts:

The Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 - the ""bounty period"" ended on 30 June 1997.

The Bounty (Ships) Act 1989 - the period to which the Act applies has been extended to 30 June 1999.

Bounty will be paid on the construction or modification of vessels that are produced according to a firm commitment entered into before 1 January 1998. In order to establish the
existence of a firm commitment the vessel must have been identified in a business plan covering the period to 30 June 1999. The plan must be lodged with the Department of
Industry, Science and Tourism, before 15 January 1998. The business plan must set out details which indicate that the construction or modification of the vessel was committed to
(either in a contract or otherwise) before 1 January 1998.

The Bounty (Ships) Act amendments also allow claims to be made for the construction or modification of vessels if the construction or modification is at least 50% complete on 30
June 1999.

The accelerated expiry of the Bounty (Books) Act 1986 and Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985, announced in the August 1996 Budget was not achieved and both bounties
will expire in line with current legislation as follows:

The Bounty (Books) Act 1986 - the ""bounty period"" ends on 31 December 1997.

The Bounty (Machine, Tools and Robots ) Act 1985 - the ""bounty period"" ended on 30 June 1997.

It should be noted that although the ""bounty period"" has now expired for the Machine Tools and Robots and Computers Bounties, the Bounty Acts have not been repealed. Rights and
obligations in respect of eligible production during the bounty periods under the Acts continue. This is particularly relevant in respect of lodgement of Returns of Factory Costs and
Statements of Difference for previous claims.

The ACS is keen to assist claimants in the finalisation of their claims. Please contact Bounty officers in your region to assist in achieving this end:

INDEXATION OF CERTAIN EXCISE AND CUSTOMS TARIFF RATES AND THE DIESEL FUEL REBATE

The provisions of section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 allow for indexation changes in February and August of each year. The changes
are related to movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

The CPI for the June quarter 1997 was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 23 July 1997.

Sub-section 6A(5) of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 requires that the June 1997 index number published by the Australian Statistician be divided by the previous highest December or June
index number for indexation purposes.

The June 1997 index number (120.2) has been divided by the December 1996 number (120.3) to establish the indexation factor of 0.999. Sub-section 6A(4) of the Act provides that
excise rates will be indexed if the factor is greater than 1. In this case, the factor does not exceed 1, and therefore there will be no indexation adjustment to excise duty rates or
equivalent customs duty rates.

As a consequence, there is no change to the rates of diesel fuel rebate declared in respect of sub-section 164(5A) of the Customs Act 1901 and sub-section 78A(5A) of the Excise Act
1901. These rates can change from month to month because of the effects of indexation and the averaging provisions of the rebate legislation. The rate applicable to a particular claim is
shown on the payment advice forwarded to applicants.

INCREASE IN FOREST AND WOOD PRODUCTS RESEARCH LEVY

This Notice is to advise that amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Forest and Wood Products) Regulations (the Regulations) have been approved which
will increase the domestic levy rates on certain forest products.

With respect to imported forest products, sub-section 6(1) of the Forest Industries Research Import Charge Act 1993 links levy rates on imported forest products proportionally to rates
levied on domestically produced equivalents through the use of class conversion factors without alteration of those conversion factors.

As a result of increasing levy rates on certain domestic classes of forest products there will be a proportionate increase in rates levied on imported equivalents.

The rates listed in the Attachment will take effect on 1 August 1997.

In addition, the Regulations provide that the forest industries levy or charge is not payable if the total amount of levy or charge that a producer is liable to pay is less than (a specific
threshold amount) in a levy year. The regulations have been amended to increase the specific threshold amount from $75 to $330.

Queries in relation to the levy should be directed to Mr Charles Hausknecht, Department of Primary Industries and Energy, Forest Branch on 06 272 4464.

certain goods during a declared period prior to the new excise and customs duty rates being implemented.

out the particular goods which are affected.

The effect of the arrangements is that persons may enter goods up to quota during the declared period (from
midnight 6 August 1997 to midnight on 20 August 1997) at the existing rates of duty. Any product entered during
the declared period in excess of the quota will attract duty at the rate of duty in force on the day immediately

On 5 August 1997 the High Court of Australia decided that certain State Business Franchise Fees are an excise and cannot be imposed by the States and Territories.At the request and
on behalf of the States and Territories, the Commonwealth will use its tax powers to collect the revenue that the States and Territories sought to collect under charges now of doubtful
constitutional validity. This will be done by increasing the excise and customs rates applicable to certain tobacco and petroleum products. The new rates will operate on and from 7
August 1997.

COMPLIANCE WITH SCHEDULE 4 TARIFF ITEMS

The purpose of this notice is to inform importers and customs brokers about compliance concerns involving the
entry of goods under certain items of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995.

An examination of the use of Schedule 4 items over several months has been conducted to determine the level of
compliance. Results from this examination follow.

Item 17 (re-introduced goods)

A significant proportion of entries using Item 17 were found to be in error.

(i) The most frequent error was use of Item 17 for goods imported for repair in Australia and then re-exported -
such goods should properly be entered under Item 21. It became apparent that Item 17 was being used for
convenience to overcome the security requirement of Item 21. As a result of this finding, Item 21 was amended in
October last year to include a new treatment code (521) to remove the requirement for a security for goods of
Australian origin.

(ii) The re-introduction of opals and other gemstones using Item 17 incorrectly was also identified as an area of
non-compliance. Consignments were found to have been entered under Item 17 on their return to Australia after
the goods had been further worked overseas (e.g. cutting and polishing). Under such circumstances the goods
should have been entered under their substantive Schedule 3 classification.

(iii) Sales tax concerns were also identified with re-introduced opals and gemstones. On re-importation these
goods have a sales tax liability but instances were found where clearance had been sought without a sales tax
certificate being quoted or sales tax having been paid.

Items 18A, 18B, 19, 20A and 21 (warranty repair/replacement, and, repair and return goods)

Significant errors were found in usage of Item 18A (warranty repaired goods) and Item 18B (warranty
replacement goods). The errors included:

value of repairs not provided
no evidence of warranty, and
sales tax incorrectly assessed.

Item 53 (Concessional entry for certain goods normally attracting 15% general rate)

Widespread misuse of this item was found. Of particular concern is that many of the errors were of a fundamental
nature in that Schedule 3 subheadings were quoted which are specifically identified as exclusions from treatment
code 653.

Item 59 (certain used and second-hand motor vehicles)

In several instances the age of motor vehicles was found to be overstated. Several cases of undervaluation were
also found. Prestige vehicles shipped from Hong Kong predominated.

Future Activity

Customs is concerned about the level of non-compliance in these areas and will be conducting comprehensive
audits with a view to undertaking recovery and possible penalty action in cases of misuse. The high level of
incorrect entry of goods found also has implications for trade statistics. Importers and their brokers should pay
particular attention to these items and ensure that past errors are rectified and that future shipments are correctly
entered.

CUSTOMS AND THE YEAR 2000 COMPUTER BUG

By December 1998, the Australian Customs Service is aiming to be in a position to confirm that its major
computer systems accord with Year 2000 standards.

The Year 2000 problem affects most computers and 'intelligent' machinery and arises where equipment has been
programmed to store dates with the years as two digits, such as '99' and cannot recognise '00' as '2000'.

Because of the high levels of computer-based interaction between Customs, industry clients and other
government agencies, there are substantial threats to business efficiency if organisations reliant on these
interfaces have not ensured their own systems are capable of handling the date change.

The Customs' Year 2000 Project is well advanced and has, as a major objective, the aim of providing our clients
with a high level of confidence in the Customs systems. It is imperative that clients afford a high priority, over the
next 12 months, to ensuring that their systems are Year 2000 compliant.

Customs plans to upgrade all its core business systems by June 1998. From September 1998, a separate testing
service will be available for several months. Clients will be able to send and receive test data to assist in proving
that both the Customs systems and the clients system will remain fully functional at the turn of the century.

All Customs systems should be fully Year 2000 compliant by December 1998. This will provide a 12 month period
during which to remedy any remaining problems which may arise.

Customs will assist industry with information sessions. Individual clients should liaise through their industry
associations who may contact either their usual Customs contact officer or the Customs Year 2000 Project
Manager, Noel Mungovan, on 02 6275 5754.

A Year 2000 component has been added to the Customs World Wide Web site
at http://www.customs.gov.au/y2k. Other useful Y2k information can be obtained from the Office of Government
Information Technology at http://www.ogit.gov.au

RENEWAL OF CUSTOMS AGENT AND CORPORATE

CUSTOMS AGENTS LICENCES

All Customs Agents Licences and Corporate Customs Agents Licences on issue expire on 31 December 1997.
ss183J(1) of the Customs Act 1901, (the Act), provides for the renewal of licences.

As in previous years ""Application for Renewal of Customs Agents Licence"" (Form B259 - Nominee and Form
B260 - Corporate and Sole Trader) will be distributed to all Customs Agents and Corporate Customs Agents
currently licensed with Customs. Licence holders will be permitted to renew their licences in any State or Territory.
Current licence holders wishing to renew their licences should make written application on their Form B259 or
B260 to the Regional Director (the RD) on or before c.o.b. 31 December 1997. Payment of the renewal fee must
accompany the renewal application.

It should be noted that failure to renew a licence by c.o.b. 31 December 1997 will render the licence invalid. This
will mean that individuals or corporate bodies who have not renewed their licences by that date, but who still wish
to be licensed, will be required to make a new application to the relevant RD. Following receipt of the new
application the RD, pursuant to Section 183CB of the Act, will forward the application to the National Customs
Agents Licensing Advisory Committee (NCALAC) which will be required to report to the RD as to whether the
applicant should be licensed or not.

Fees in respect of the renewal of a Customs agents licence are to be paid not later than the day on which the
renewal of the licence is to come into force (Customs Regulation No.160). The fee payable (Customs
Regulation 158) in respect of the grant or renewal of a Customs agents licence is:

1. where the Customs agent is a natural person who does not intend to act, at any time when the licence is in
force in his/her own right - $20; or

2. in any other case $200.

In order to facilitate the processing of the Forms B259 and B260 by Customs, licence holders intending to renew
their licences, are requested to complete either their Form B259 or B260 and lodge it, together with the respective
fee, with the RD well before 31 December 1997.

Corporate Customs Agents are also requested to include with their application form:

1. a list of all nominees currently employed with their agency; and

2. a list of all persons currently having authority to direct the nominees of the agency for the purposes of the Act.

In relation to this request Corporate Customs agents are reminded that, in accordance with sub - section
183CG(3) of the Act, it is a condition of their licence that the Chief Executive Officer be advised within thirty (30)
days of a change of nominees, persons authorised to direct nominees or composition of a partnership.

Distribution of Renewal Notices

The ""Application for Renewal of the Licence"" segment of the Renewal Notice will be forwarded directly to the last
known address of the licensee. The licensee will then be responsible for presenting that segment of the renewal
application to the Customs cashier for payment of the licence fee.

When accepting the ""Application for Renewal of the Licence"" segment of the Renewal Notice and the renewal
payment from the licensee, the cashier will input the Customs brokers licence number into the ""Revenue
Collection System"", which in turn will record the transaction and issue two copies of a receipt.

The original of the receipt will be given to the licensee with the ""Licence"" segment of the Renewal Notice.

The ""Application for Renewal of the Licence"" segment of the Renewal Notice which will have been given to the
cashier by the licensee, will then be given by the cashier to the Customs Brokers Licensing Officer together with
the copy of the Revenue Collection System receipt for his/her records.

CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSAL No. 7 (1997) CHANGES TO

AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY ARRANGEMENTS

On 5 June 1997, at a joint press conference with the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Science and
Tourism, the Prime Minister announced the following changes to automotive industry policy:

The current tariff phasing regime to the year 2000 for all passenger motor vehicles (PMV) and certain PMV
components is to remain and the 15% rate extended to 31 December 2004. From 1 January 2005, the rate of
duty will be reduced to 10%;
Four wheel drive vehicles and light commercial vehicles will remain at a rate of duty of 5%;
The 15 % duty-free allowance will continue to be available to vehicle producers;
A World Trade Organization-consistent programme will be introduced to replace the Export Facilitation
Scheme when it expires in 2000. It will run to 2005;
There will be a review in 2005 which will take account of our APEC commitments and progress on market
access; and
There will also be an environmental strategy including measures to phase out the use of leaded fuel by 2010
and the development of an industry code on environmental performance.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 7 (1997) was introduced into the House of Representatives on 3 September 1997 to
legislate the reduction of tariffs to 10% on 1 January 2005. Additional initiatives have been implemented in these
changes -

The completion of the phase-out of the Developing Country margin of preference for Hong Kong, Republic of
Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province. This initiative was announced in the ""Building a Competitive Australia""
Statement on 12 March 1991;

The continuation of the phase-out of the DCS margin of preference which commenced on 1 July 1993 and
was further extended on 1 July 1994. DCS countries and places are listed in Part 2 of Schedule 1 of
the Customs Tariff Act 1995;
The maintenance of the Canadian margins of preference negotiated under the ""CANATA"" trade agreement;
and
Subheadings 8483.60.10 and 9032.89.11 are encompassed by this decision. Both subheadings are the
subject of WTO phase-downs on 1 January 1999 to 13%.
Further, an end date of 31 December 2004 has been inserted in item 53 in Part III of Schedule 4. A new item
53A has been created to provide a similar phase-down to item 53 for non-PMV components from 10% to 5%
on and from 1 January 2005.

The tariff reprint pages containing these changes are being prepared and will be despatched within the next
month.

CALCULATION OF EXCISE AND CUSTOMS RATES OF DUTY FOR CERTAIN TOBACCO PRODUCTS

Following the High Court of Australia's decision that certain business franchise fees are an excise and cannot be imposed by the States and Territories, and in response to the request of
the States and Territories, the Commonwealth increased duties on certain tobacco products by $167 to $251.27 per kilogram, effective on and from 7 August 1997.

At the time of these arrangements being put in place, the Treasurer stated that the Commonwealth was aware of the effects on the tobacco industry of replacing the value-based
franchise fees with a weight-based system and that the Commonwealth would consider alternative arrangements that would be neutral as between different manufacturers.

At the request of the States and Territories, the Commonwealth has agreed to introduce a 'hybrid' ad valorem and weight based regime. The new 'hybrid' rate comprises a weight based
duty component and an ad valorem component applied to the wholesale list prices declared by the Chief Executive Officer and published in the Commonwealth gazette. Should a
wholesale list price not be declared for a particular product a solely weight based rate will apply to that product.

The new arrangements are contained in Excise Tariff Notices Nos. 4 (1997) and Customs Tariff Notices Nos. 4 (1997), published in Special Commonwealth Gazette No. S 358 of 16
September 1997. The wholesale list prices were published in Special Commonwealth Gazette No. S 359 of 17 September 1997.

The new rates and wholesale list prices take effect on and from 17 September 1997.
Table 1 and 2 of the Attachment provide the new rates.

COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OUTAGE NOTIFICATION

The Australian Customs Service in conjunction with the CBCA and AT&amp;T completed a review of the method
by which our commercial clients are notified about disruptions to any or all of the commercial computer
applications. The commercial computer applications include COMPILE, EFT, EXIT, Air Cargo Automation, Sea
Cargo Automation and EDIFICE.

Previously AT&amp;T, as the contracted Tradegate network provider and based on information supplied by the
ACS, was responsible for outage notification. Notification was by telephone status messages at the AT&amp;T
help desk, direct output of information to Customs Broker's printers and in some cases by fax to certain areas of
the Trading Community.

With the review of the notification procedures now complete, the ACS wishes to advise its client base of the new
notification arrangements. These arrangements are in place and operational now. The procedures will operate on
a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week basis.

The Notification Arrangements

Responsibility

Where the problem lies with the ACS, outage notification to our clients will be undertaken by the ACS.

Where the problem lies within the AT&amp;T network outage notification to the Trading Community will be
undertaken by AT&amp;T.

Where the cause of the problem is unknown, the ACS will undertake outage notification.

Method of notification

Two primary methods of notification have been identified:

Telephone status messages on the AT&amp;T help desk (phone number 131357);

Immediate email broadcast messages to subscribers of 'Attmail' (also known as CBCMail);

Where COMPILE Contingencies are to be declared (and subsequently withdrawn), AT&amp;T will undertake
a Trading Community-wide fax notification broadcast.

Notification E-Mail audience

Trading Community members who will receive the notification (providing they have subscribed to Attmail) are
Customs Brokers, Freight Forwarders, Depots, Terminals, EXIT I users, EXIT II users, Air/Sea Lines and
CTOs.

Method of operation

When a problem occurs with one or more of the ACS applications, the National Customer Support Centre
(NCSC) will broadcast a status email message to the Attmail subscriber group.

Where possible, the ACS will also flash a message through COMPILE asking clients to check their Attmail for
an urgent notification message.

Where the problem is AT&amp;T network related, AT&amp;T will broadcast a status message to the
subscriber group.

Regardless of the which organisation 'owns' the problem, AT&amp;T will insert a status message on their
help desk answering service.

Regular status updates will also be sent to subscribers by the ACS until the problem has been resolved. A
final message will be broadcast upon resolution of the problem. Where possible, the final message will inform
clients of the expected message turnaround delays and the expected time to clear the backlog of messages.

NOTICE OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to
them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, this Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two years from the commencement date shown or
until, as indicated where applicable, the registration of the nominated trade mark expires.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the
particular trade marks relate to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks
covering a diversity of goods, it has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case
prospective importers should seek further advice regarding the coverage of the Notices of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade marks they are liable to
be seized by Customs, unless it can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or

- the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in
question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably
qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade
mark. The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding
the Notice of Objection, or Customs' role in regard to this Notice, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs Service Office in their nearest capital city.

REMOVAL OF DISTILLATION REG 5(f)(i) - MINIMUM STILL

CAPACITIES

With effect from 24 September 1997 Distillation Reg 5(f) has been amended by the deletion of sub-paragraph (i)
regarding minimum still capacities. Sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) have been re-numbered (i) and (ii)
respespectively but otherwise remain unchanged apart from some minor wording changes.

As a consequence of this amendment a Distiller's Licence may be granted in relation to a still of any capacity. It
should be noted however, that all other existing requirements will need to be met before a licence will be granted.

Sections 10, 11 and 11A of the Distillation Act contain some of the general requirements relating to stills. These
are outlined below for the benefit of potential licence applicants.

Section 10 makes it an offence to make, move, erect or import a still without prior permission from Customs.
Without permission, it is also an offence to acquire by purchase or otherwise, or dispose of by sale or otherwise, a
still on its own or as part of property or a premise.

Section 11 requires a person using a still for purposes other than distilling spirits to notify Customs as to the
capacity and location of the still and the purpose for which it will be used. Failure to register this information with
Customs will render the still illicit.

Section 11A exempts stills with a capacity of not more than five litres from the requirements of Sections 10 and
11.

Any inquiries concerning these changes should be directed to the Assistant Director, Alcohol and Tobacco, Excise
Branch, on (02) 6275 6103.

INCORRECTLY QUOTED SALES TAX RATES

Customs has adopted a strategy known as Compliance Improvement in the delivery of government assistance measures and revenue collection. In an environment of self assessment,
the principal objective of the Compliance Improvement initiative is to maximise levels of voluntary compliance.

Customs has recently undertaken a review of import data in respect of items covered by Schedule 5 of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Schedule 5 provides the rates
of sales tax on a range of items. Since 1 July 1995 the sales tax rate for Schedule 5 items has been 32%, prior to this date the rate was 31%. A copy of the schedule of items is
attached.

As a result of this review it has become apparent that there is significant misapplication of the sales tax rates applying to imported goods falling within this Schedule. There are many
instances where the incorrect sales tax rate is quoted on an entry for home consumption resulting in short payments of sales tax.

Customs views this as a serious situation and is undertaking a comprehensive audit treatment of imported goods which fall to Schedule 5, with a view to implementing action to collect
the unpaid tax. Section 76 of the Sales Tax Assessment Act provides that short paid sales tax can be recovered for up to 3 years after the time when it became payable.

Importers and Customs brokers are advised to check all import entries of goods covered by Schedule 5 which have quoted a sales tax rate to verify that the correct rate has been used.
Customs will endeavour to assist brokers to confirm that their client's sales tax liabilities have been complied with in full by providing entry history data in accordance with the procedures
set out in ACN 94/3.

Where an error has occurred, importers or brokers should lodge an amending entry using the correct sales tax rate for the goods and tendering the sales tax shortpaid. Where post
warrant amendment provisions do not permit coverage of the full period, the broker should contact Customs for details on how to tender any short payments. Voluntary tenders of any
tax short paid may result in a reduction of sales tax penalty.

If amending entries have not been lodged by 1 January 1998, Customs will take action to re-assess sales tax liability where appropriate.

Enquires regarding this matter should be directed to Mr Jim Collins, National Business Centre (General Business) on (07) 3835 3282.

CHANGES TO COMPILE CUSTOMS OWNER/SUPPLIER (COS)

CODES SYSTEM

The new COS system was introduced on 8 June 1996 to allow COMPILE users to create and amend their COS
codes. This system has been subject to a review and Customs are preparing to implement the following changes
from 15 November 1997.

The current 'Update strategy' which allows for old COS codes to be migrated to the new COS system by
updating the codes with address and other details will cease from 15 November 1997.

COMPILE users should ensure they have completed the transfer of any 'old codes' to the new system by that
date.

The COS Name Search facility is being removed from COMPILE users. This facility is now redundant as the
new COS system will advise the user, on entering owner or supplier details (at COS code creation), of either
the existing code or a new code number will be allocated.
A mandatory telephone number is required for new owner codes or for changes to existing codes where an
Australian Company Number (ACN) is not used. Due to privacy provisions and other considerations these
phone numbers will not be available for display by COMPILE Users.
To maintain data integrity, only licensed brokers and importers will be able to make COS code amendments
once a code has been used in entry creation.
Where an owner code containing an ACN has been used to create an entry, future amendments to the ACN
will be restricted to Customs User Liaison sections in each Region.
New COS codes can be back-dated where necessary upon application to Custom's User Liaison sections.

These changes are designed to improve the efficiency of the allocation and update of COS code information with
minimum impact on industry users.

Instructional material (Compile User's Access to Create COS Codes; Part 2 - COMPILE II User Manual
Supplement October. 1997) is being prepared. Users will be advised through the 'COMPILE Broadcast System'
when this material will be available for collection from regional User Liaison sections.

Customs' approach in these matters is that refunds are paid automatically (and only) to the applicant(s) who took
the matter to the AAT/court on appeal. These refunds do not require an application for refund and are generated
by Customs in the State in which the matter was determined.

Refunds are also available upon application to all other importers of the same goods from the date of the review
decision subject to the provisions of Regulation 128A(5) provided it can be satisfactorily established that the
goods were in fact entered in error. In these latter situations the circumstance in Regulation 126(1)(e) applies
subject to the usual application process set out in Regulation 128(1).

WHOLESALE LIST PRICES FOR TOBACCO AND

CIGARETTES

Following on from the safety net arrangements put in place to compensate the State and Territory governments
for the loss of revenue resulting from the High Court decision on business franchise fees, the new arrangements
for calculation of excise and customs duty on tobacco and cigarettes require wholesale list prices for these
products to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.

The duty rate is a hybrid of a weight based component plus a percentage of a wholesale list price. Should a
wholesale list price not be declared for a particular product a solely weight based rate will apply to that product.

These wholesale list prices were published in Commonwealth of Australia Gazettes Nos. S359 of 17 September
1997, S395 of 7 October 1997 and S413 of 15 October 1997. It is anticipated that future revised wholesale list
prices will be gazetted on the second Wednesday of each month.

FUTURE OF CUSTOMS IMPORT ENTRY PROCESSING

SYSTEMS

Customs has recently concluded a review of future directions for its existing import entry processing systems,
namely COMPILE, Interim EDIFICE and EDIFICE.

At the 17th meeting of the Customs National Consultative Council in December 1996, the Chief Executive Officer
of Customs signalled an intention to consider phasing out the COMPILE system. He promised a minimum of two
years notice before the COMPILE service was withdrawn and indicated that consultation with COMPILE users
would be undertaken prior to any formal commitment on the timing being made.

In March this year a discussion paper was published and distributed to all COMPILE users. Following the receipt
of submissions, a consultative group consisting of Peter Johnson and Lawrence Chan from Customs, Ron Aitken,
the COMPILE User Representative, and Ernie Dean, the Vice President of the CBCA was formed.

After consultation with approximately 60 companies and associations Australia-wide, a findings paper was
released on 1 September 1997.

Customs has now considered all information gained from the consultative process and has decided to adopt the
following strategy:

immediate attention will be focussed on ensuring that the EDIFICE support infrastructure will deliver the
levels of reliability and performance necessary to satisfy users requirements;

EDIFICE will be further enhanced to the point where, by 30 June 1999, it will be capable of delivering all the
functionality currently provided by COMPILE;

existing COMPILE and Interim EDIFICE services will continue to be supported until at least the end of the
year 2000.

In establishing this direction, Customs is mindful of the fact that developments arising from the Integrated Cargo
System component of the Cargo Management Strategy are likely to alter the nature of cargo reporting and
clearance processes and systems.

As different data reporting requirements develop, the clearly-defined, standards-based

interface which EDIFICE establishes is expected to prove much more flexible and adaptable than the direct
COMPILE interface. Customs recognises, however, the need to continue to balance the use of on-line interactive
and EDI-based services to best meet a range of client needs.

A project team will be established, in the near future, to commence design of the Integrated Cargo System. This
design exercise will be conducted in close consultation with industry and will seek to ensure that future risks,
posed by the increasing age, difficulty of acquiring skilled resources, and cost to maintain the core COMPILE
system, are minimised. It is expected that a number of aspects of the Integrated Cargo System will start to be
implemented during the period covered by the strategy outlined above

Customs is currently evaluating options for provision of an Internet-based import entry declaration facility which
will initially be aimed at providing a lower cost alternative to the present manual entry processing option. This
facility will be available by 1 April 1998. It is expected that over the coming years, the Internet will play a greater
role in the delivery of Customs electronic systems.

Reassessment of the longer term support of COMPILE and Interim EDIFICE will be undertaken once more detail
of the Integrated Cargo System is developed and the potential for the use of the Internet as a service delivery
medium has been tested. An update on this announcement can therefore be expected towards the middle of
1998. In the meantime current users of the Customs import entry processing systems may rest assured that all of
the current service offerings will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future.

CHANGES TO PROCEDURES FOR EXAMINING AND

APPROVING APPLICATIONS FOR SINGLE TRANSACTION

PERMISSIONS (STPs) UNDER SECTION 71E OF THE

CUSTOMS ACT AND 61A OF THE EXCISE ACT

The Australian Customs Service (ACS) has recently reviewed its procedures related to the approval of
applications for Single Transaction Permissions (STPs), under section 71E of the Customs Act and section 61A of
the Excise Act, for the movement of goods from warehouses licensed under section 79 of the Customs Act and
from places approved under section 5A of the Excise Act.

STPs provide Permission Holders with access to goods on which customs or excise duty has not been paid. Such
access increases the potential risk of diversion of the goods and the loss of revenue and there have been
instances of underbond goods with high duty values being diverted into home consumption while being subject to
movement permissions.

The potential risk to the revenue of allowing the movement of goods between bonds has increased significantly
with the recent substantial surcharge imposed on import and excise duties on tobacco and petroleum products.
These resulted from the Commonwealth putting in place safety net arrangements to protect State and Territory
revenue following the High Court's decision on State business franchise fees.

In recognition of the significant duty liability and risks associated with underbond movement permissions, the
review focussed on tightening up the procedures for issuing STP's. Changes have been introduced to the
processes used for examining and making determinations on applications for STPs, with greater emphasis on the
risk assessment of applicants. Where the revenue is considered to be at risk, approval will not be granted.

While the ACS is conscious of the need for quick decisions to meet commercial timetables, there may be
circumstances under which further investigation is required on an application and a same day decision is not
possible. There will be no automatic approval of STP applications and each application will be assessed as to its
risk.

Applicants for STP's can assist in this process by providing all the required information and by lodging
applications sufficiently in advance of the intended movement of the goods.

The STP Application Form has been revised and will be available for use shortly. The Application Form seeks
additional information on the owner, the goods and the premises to which the goods are to be moved, to assist
Customs to evaluate the application. An incomplete application may result in delays in providing a decision or in
the application being refused.

Approvals for STP's will be issued only to the owners of the goods.

There is provision for Customs to take security with surety in circumstances where this is considered appropriate.

The changed procedures relate only to applications for the movement of underbond goods under the authority of
an STP between premises licensed under section 79 of the Customs Act and places approved under section 5A
of the Excise Act. Other forms of application under section 71 E of the Customs Act, such as those for Query
Memo examination, made on form B614a, or the movement of goods for the purpose of public exhibition under
section 97(1) of the Customs Act, are not covered by these procedures.

Any queries concerning these changes should be directed to the Director, Alcohol, Tobacco and Warehousing,
Excise Branch, Canberra, on (02) 6275 6109.

COMPILE AND SEA CARGO AUTOMATION (SCA) CARGO

RELEASE ARRANGEMENTS

New arrangements for the release of cargo, to be known as ""print contingency release"" will be available to
Customs Brokers through a new facility in the COMPILE system from 25 October 1997.

These arrangements will apply when there are outages or significant delays affecting the transmission or receipt
of advice (""the SCA release"") to container terminal and depot operators that cargo is authorised to be released.

On and from 25 October 1997, Customs Brokers will have access to a ""print contingency release"" option within
their COMPILE facility. When the print-out is presented to container terminal and depot operators, and no SCA
release has been received, the cargo to which it relates may be released.

These new arrangements are intended for use under the following circumstances:

when there are significant delays or a complete failure to transmit the SCA release to container
terminals and container depot operators.

when technical problems experienced by container terminals and container depot operators prevent
or significantly delay the receipt of the SCA release.

The contingency release print-out can only be generated by COMPILE:

if at least 2 hours has elapsed since the original advice authorising release of the cargo was
transmitted to the container terminal or depot operator.

if an authority to deal in the goods has been granted under the provisions of s.71B of the Customs
Act 1901.

The ""print contingency release"" print-out will indicate the name of the container terminal or depot operator to
whom the original advice authorising release of the cargo was transmitted and the date and time of that
transmission.

The ""print contingency release"" print-out will also indicate whether the authority to deal is subject to Australian
Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) or Motor Vehicle Standards Association (MVSA) conditions.

COMPILE user manuals will be updated shortly to reflect the new arrangements.

Any queries in relation to the new arrangements should be directed to the SCA Help Desk in your Region.

Fuel Substitution Minimisation Legislation exemption of certain customable and excisable 
petroleum products from marking
As part of 1997-98 Budget initiatives, the Government announced that it intended to combat the loss of revenue resulting from the direct substitution of duty free or low duty petroleum 
products for those products which attracted a rate of customs or excise duty commensurate with on-road use.

Legislation giving effect to this initiative has been passed by the Parliament and is scheduled to take effect on and from 31 January 1998.

The legislation requires the addition of a chemical marker to certain petroleum products that are cleared for home consumption at a concessional or free rate of duty. On the advice of the 
oil industry, the marker selected is Mortrace MP and it is to be added at a prescribed dosage of 20 parts per million weight per volume.

Petroleum solvents will need to contain the marker. However, it is recognised that the marker could have an adverse effect on the performance of the marked product or other 
undesirable outcomes in certain specialised applications. It is also recognised that the nature or cost of certain specialised petroleum products is such that their use as fuel substitutes is 
not viable. While it is not considered that there will be a large incidence of solvents meeting the criteria, Customs recognises that in certain cases, unmarked bulk solvents are required.

Accordingly, Customs is putting in place legislative arrangements for the remission or refund of customs and excise duty in respect of unmarked petroleum products as solvents to 
address the industry concerns where it is feared that the marker could affect the performance of the solvent. These arrangements will take effect from 31 January 1998 (new Customs 
Regulations 126(1)(w) and (x) and Excise Regulations 50(1)(zg) and (zh), Statutory Rules 1997 Nos 378 and 384 refer). Remission of duty will only be available in respect of petroleum 
products which are delivered into home consumption pursuant to a permission under section 61C of the Excise Act 1901 or section 69 of the Customs Act 1901 and will be tightly 
controlled and granted subject to rigorous scrutiny of whether these criteria are met.

Availability of the benefit of the remission by users of products as solvents

The benefit of the remission in respect of petroleum products as solvents will not automatically be available to all users of products as solvents. The details of this availability are still 
being settled and will be notified later in January 1998. In the meantime, users of petroleum products as solvents who require unmarked product on which the remission has been given 
will need to apply to Customs.

All applications should be addressed by users to the Manager, Minerals and Petroleum National Business Centre in Melbourne, Customs House, 414 Latrobe Street, Melbourne, VIC

Valuation - privately Imported Motor Vehicles &amp; Motor

Cycles

Background

A review of the administrative procedures and Customs policy in regard to the Valuation of privately imported
motor vehicles and motor cycles has been completed. The review considered the appropriateness of the current
policy having regard to the requirements of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Valuation Agreement (which is
the basis for the Australian valuation legislation), current trading trends and legal precedents.

Introduction

The Customs Act (the Act), s159 prescribes the methods to be used to value imported goods. These methods are
to be applied in the order set out by the legislation.

Transaction Value Method

In determining the Customs Value of privately imported motor vehicles and motor cycles, the Transaction Value
method will apply where the importer can demonstrate that the sale under consideration took place for the
purpose of exporting the vehicle or cycle to Australia.

The determination of Customs Value using this method will be based on the price actually paid or payable for the
vehicle in a bona fide sale where the price is not influenced by any other factors.

Transaction Value may not apply when Customs considers that there is insufficient and unreliable information
(s160 of the Act) made available. Where the Transaction Value method cannot be applied, the Act requires that
the alternate valuation methods are considered.

Identical, Similar, Deductive and Computed Methods

The legislation provides for the sequential application of the Identical, Similar, Deductive or Computed Valuation
methods. As such, regard must be had to each method. However, to utilise these methods the Collector needs to
be in possession of specific and relevant information including details concerning sales of equivalent vehicles or
cycles which have occurred ""about the same time"" (as defined in s.154(2) of the Act) as the vehicle or cycle to be
valued. It is highly unlikely that the information necessary to allow the Collector to utilise these valuation methods
would be accessible to the Collector. Unless that information is available to the Collector, it is likely that the
application of these methods to the valuation of privately imported motor vehicles and cycles would not be
practical.

Where it is not possible to utilise the Identical, Similar, Deductive or Computed Valuation methods, the Fall Back
method (s161G of the Act) will be applied.

Fall-Back Method - Section 161G

The fall-back method will be applied when the previous methods cannot be used to determine a correct Customs
Value. This provides some flexibility in comparison with the other methods as the Collector, while still having
regard to each of those methods in turn, can also have regard to any other matter considered relevant.

Section 161G of the Act requires the Collector to determine value having regard to the methods of Valuation
contained in the Act and in the same sequence. The Collector will determine ""fall-back"" values in the following
way:

Fall-Back Transaction Value method
The limitation on using the price paid in respect of the Fall-Back Transaction Value method is affected by the fact
that, potentially, the sale of the vehicle or motor cycle in the exporting country could be regarded as a sale on the
domestic market of that country. Australian Customs legislation prohibits the price of those goods on the domestic
market (of the exporting country) being used as the basis for Customs Value.

Fall-Back Identical and Similar Valuation methods

Amendments to the Customs Regulations and Customs
(Prohibited Exports) Regulations

The following amendments to the Customs Regulations and Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations were 
notified in Special Gazette No. S558 of 1997 on 24 December 1997. The amendments commenced on gazettal.

TEMPORARY IMPORTS - YEAR 2000 OLYMPICS

The amendments to the Customs Regulations (by Statutory Rules 1997 No. 379) provide for the temporary 
importation, without payment of duty and/or sales tax provided a security or undertaking is established, of goods 
imported into Australia to be used in or for purposes related to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and a number of 
related events.

In order to implement the obligation in the Host City contract to facilitate the temporary importation of goods for 
use in or purposes related to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, new regulation 125A has been inserted to confer 
the temporary importation provisions of s162A of the Customs Act 1901 on such goods.

The new provisions will also apply to the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games and a number of other associated 
sporting and cultural events endorsed by the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG).

Any enquiries concerning these amendments should be directed to Jennifer Reimitz, Cargo Facilitation Branch, 
Canberra on (02) 6275 6569.

SANCTIONS AGAINST ANGOLA

The United Nations Security Council imposed, via Resolutions 1127 of 28 August 1997 and 1135 of 29 October 
1997, further sanctions against the Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA). These 
sanctions include restrictions on the supply of aircraft and aircraft components, other than through named entry 
points, to the territory of Angola.

Those aspects of the resolution restricting the sale or supply of goods are implemented in Australia by regulation 
13E of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations which was amended by Statutory Rules 1997 No. 382. 
Regulation 13E prohibits the exportation from Australia of these goods unless permission to export has been 
granted in writing by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade or an authorised person. Where granted, the 
permission must be presented to Customs at or before the time of exportation.

These sanctions are in addition to previous restrictions on the exportation, from Australia, of petroleum and 
petroleum products, to Angola, imposed via United Nations Security Council Resolution No 864 of 1993. ACN 
94/37 of 10 June 1994 refers.

Any enquiries concerning these amendments should be directed to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 
Canberra on (02) 6261 1249.

SANCTIONS AGAINST SIERRA LEONE

The United Nations Security Council imposed, via Resolution 1132 of 8 October 1997, restrictions on the sale or 
supply to Sierra Leone of petroleum and petroleum products, and paramilitary equipment.

Those aspects of the resolution restricting the sale or supply of goods are implemented in Australia by new 
regulation 13CH of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations which was inserted by Statutory Rules 1997 
No. 382. Regulation 13CH prohibits the exportation from Australia of these goods unless permission to export has 
been granted in writing by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade or an authorised person. Where granted, the 
permission must be presented to Customs at or before the time of exportation.

CUSTOMS ACT 1901 AND SUBSECTION 59A 910 OF THE
EXCISE ACT 1901 - TOBACCO PRODUCTS

The Chief Executive Officer has decided to exercise his power under Section 59A of the Excise Act 1901 and 
Section 132B of the Customs Act 1901 to allow quotas to be imposed on the entry into home consumption of 
tobacco products during a declared period prior to excise and customs duty anticipated rate increases in early 
1998. Attached is a copy of the Gazette notices setting out the declared periods and the base periods. The 
notices set out the particular goods which are affected.

The effect of the arrangements is that persons may enter goods up to quota during the declared period at the 
rates of duty existing at the time. Any product entered during the declared period in excess of the quota will 
attract duty at the rate in force on the day immediately following the last day of the declared period. Quota will be 
based on products entered during the base period.

In instances where entries are lodged for tobacco products during the declared period and no quota has been 
issued, Customs will determine whether a quota is appropriate and if so issue a quota order.

NOTICE OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADEMARKS ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule
which have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force for a period of two years
from the commencement date shown.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to
the contrary, the particular trade marks relate to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. In any case, prospective importers should seek further advice
regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade marks
they are liable to be seized by Customs, unless it can be established that:

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or
the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed
where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from
Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar
to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark. The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish to initiate negotiations
regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further
information regarding the Notices of Objection, or Customs' role in regard to these Notices, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs
Service Office in their nearest capital city.

INCORRECTLY QUOTED SALES TAX RATES ON ALCOHOLIC

PRODUCTS

Customs has adopted a strategy known as Compliance Improvement in the delivery of government assistance
measures and revenue collection. In an environment of self assessment, the principal objective of the
Compliance Improvement initiative is to maximise levels of voluntary compliance.

Customs has recently undertaken a review of import data in respect of items covered by Schedules 4 and 7 of the
Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. These Schedules provide the rates of sales tax on wine, cider
and other alcoholic beverages. The sales tax rate applicable to Schedules 4 and 7 are 37% and 41%
respectively. Prior to 3.30pm AEST on 6 August 1997 the rates were 22% and 26%.

As a result of the Customs review it has become apparent that there is significant misapplication of the sales tax
rates applying to imported goods falling within Schedules 4 and 7. There are many instances where the incorrect
sales tax rate has been quoted on an entry for home consumption resulting in short payments of sales tax.

Customs is undertaking a comprehensive compliance assessment of imported goods which fall to Schedules 4
and 7, with a view to implementing action to collect the unpaid tax. Section 76 of the Sales Tax Assessment Act
provides that short paid sales tax can be recovered for up to three (3) years after the time when it becomes
payable.

Importers and Customs brokers are advised to check all import entries of goods covered by Schedules 4 and 7
which have quoted a sales tax rate to verify that the correct rate has been used. Customs will endeavour to assist
brokers to confirm that their client's sales tax liabilities have been complied with in full by providing entry history
data in accordance with the procedures set out in ACN 94/3.

Where an error has occurred, importers or brokers should lodge an amending entry using the correct sales tax
rate for the goods and tendering sales tax short paid. Voluntary tenders of any tax short paid may result in a
reduction of sales tax penalty.

If amending entries have not been lodged by 1 April 1998, Customs will take action to re-assess sales tax liability
where appropriate.

Enquires regarding this matter should be directed to Mr Robert Harkins, National Business Centre (Alcohol) on
(02) 9893 4304 or Mr Phil Lane, National Business Centre (Spirits) on (08) 8447 9385.

NEW IMPORTS AND EXPORT CONTROLS ON OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES (ODS)

Recent amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations (by Statutory Rules 1997 No. 385) prohibit the importation or
exportation of ozone depleting substances controlled under the Ozone Protection Act 1989. Regulation 5K of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations prohibits the importation of
substances listed in Schedule 10 to the regulation and Regulation 13F of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations prohibits the exportation of substances listed in Schedule 15 of
that regulation.

The new regulations make those substances listed in the schedules prohibited imports or prohibited exports under the Customs Act 1901, unless the substances are covered by a
licence to import or export which has been granted by the Minister for the Environment under section 16 of the Ozone Protection Act and the licence is produced to a Collector.

Clearance for import or export of these substances will not be granted unless a valid licence number is provided. It is an offence under the Customs Act to quote an incorrect licence
number or an incorrect tariff or AHECC code.

The intention of the new regulations is to fulfil the government's obligations under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.

The regulations however exempt products listed in the Customs Tariff Act 1995 under heading 3004 and in Chapters 39 and 84, as generally these products are manufactured goods
which use ODS as part of their everyday operation. Examples of exempt goods are asthma spray dispensers, polystyrene packaging and insulation, refrigerators and air-conditioning
equipment.

Whilst these products may not be covered by the new regulations they are covered by the Ozone Protection Act, which prohibits their importation and exportation. It is therefore
suggested that importers or exporters of these products seek the advice of the Environment Protection Group within Department of the Environment in Canberra prior to importing or
exporting these goods.

Any enquiries concerning the Ozone Protection Act controls should be directed to Kathryn Collins (02) 6274 1457 or Carey Robinson (02) 6274 1631 of the Environment Protection
Group.

Any enquiries concerning either the Customs policy or the customs control procedures relating to the new regulations should be directed to the appropriate Customs section listed in the
attachment to this notice.

FUEL SUBSTITUTION MINIMISATION LEGISLATION CUSTOMS AND EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENTS

As foreshadowed by Australian Customs Notice No. 97/42 and detailed in Australian Customs Notice No. 98/01, legislation to combat the loss of revenue resulting from the substitution
of duty free or low duty petroleum products for products which attract a rate of customs or excise duty commensurate with products for on-road use will take effect on and from 31
January 1998.

As part of the process of implementing the new legislation, there has been widespread consultation between Customs representatives and interested parties since the proposed
measures were announced as part of the 1997/98 Budget. Information on the new requirements has been conveyed to those parties as part of the consultation process. Parties
consulted include oil refiners and distributors, the Australian Institute of Petroleum, the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association, the Australian Petroleum Production
and Exploration Association, the National Farmers Federation, the Road Transport Forum, the Service Stations Association, the Oil Recyclers Association of Australia, motoring
organisations and Federal, State and Territory Consumer Affairs, Environment and Revenue authorities. Information about the new provisions is also summarised in a pamphlet available
from Customs Information Centres in each capital city.

A pivotal part of the legislative package is amendment of appropriate parts of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to define those concessional products which
must have the prescribed chemical marker added to them prior to entry into home consumption. Except for fuel oil and products in packages not exceeding 210 litres, marking is required
for products for use as fuel otherwise than in internal combustion engines, such as heating oil and kerosene, which attract a duty rate of 7.200 cents per litre and petroleum products for
non-fuel use, such as for use as solvents, which are free of duty.

The legislative amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921 are contained in:

the Customs Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Act 1997- Act No. 162 of 1997;
the Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 4) 1997 - Act No. 168 of 1997;
the Excise Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Act 1997 - Act No. 161 of 1997; and
Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 4) 1997 - Act No. 169 of 1997.

Customs Tariff reprint pages issued in conjunction with these changes are:

27/1 (R.1), 27/3 (R.4), 27/5 (R.6), 27/7 (R.1) and 27/9 (0 - new page).

page).

Attachments ""A"" and ""B"" to this notice contain concordances of Customs tariff subheadings and Excise tariff items affected by these amendments.

Alterations to the Table in Section 19(1) of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to incorporate the changes to tariff subheadings and excise items made by this legislation will be gazetted in the

PENALTIES APPLYING TO SHORT PAYMENTS OF SALES

TAX

Australian Customs Notice (ACN) 97/79 advised that Customs had undertaken a review of import data relating to
items covered by Schedule 5 of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992. The review found that
there was significant misapplication of sales tax rates applying to imported goods falling within this Schedule.

Importers and Customs brokers were advised to check all import entries of goods covered by Schedule 5 and
where an error had occurred to lodge an amending entry and tender any sales tax shortpaid. Advice was given
that voluntary tenders made before 1 January 1998 may result in a reduction of any imposed sales tax penalty.
While there is evidence that there have been shortpayments of sales tax in respect of a number of importations,
the response to ACN 97/79 in terms of voluntary payments has been virtually non-existent. This Notice is being
issued to extend that deadline until 3 April 1998 and to provide information on penalties applying to
shortpayments of sales tax.

Section 68 of the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 (STAA) creates a liability to a penalty where sales tax remains
unpaid after the date on which it would otherwise have been payable. This is generally termed a ""late payment""
penalty. Section 97 STAA creates a liability to a penalty where a person makes a false statement which results in
a shortpayment of sales tax. This may be termed a ""false statement"" penalty. The ""false statement"" penalty can
apply where false statements resulting in shortpayments of sales tax are made at the time of importation. Where
false statements resulting in shortpayments of sales tax are detected/disclosed after importation (for example
during an audit process or as a result of activity such as that outlined in ACN 97/79) both ""false statement""
penalty AND ""late payment"" penalty may be applied. In serious cases, prosecution action may be taken. The
Commissioner of Taxation can issue a demand for payment of shortpayments of sales tax and any imposed
administrative penalty up to three years after the sales tax became payable.

The application of penalties issued under the STAA is a complex matter and many factors are taken into
consideration. The following two paragraphs outline the main provisions but do not attempt to provide all the
detail. Further information can be obtained from Mr Tom Marshall on (08) 8447 9280 or reference can be made to
SST Ruling No 3 Sales Tax: Guidelines for Penalty Remission.

The ""false statement"" penalty is imposed at 200% of the shortpaid amount. If an importer makes a false
statement and subsequently brings it to Customs attention, the nature of the error, and the fact that it was
disclosed voluntarily may influence the level of the penalty significantly and it may be remitted in full. The same
factors may also impact on the ""late payment"" penalty (imposed at the rate of 16% per annum) and could result in
up to half of this penalty being remitted.

If an error is detected by Customs during an audit, the ""false statement"" penalty can also be subject to remission.
One factor which may influence the level of penalty is positive action by the taxpayer which results in a significant
saving in time and resources in completing the audit.

Penalties issued under the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 are additional to those imposed on shortpayments of
Customs Duty by Customs Act s243T.

From 6 April 1998 Customs will be examining past importations looking specifically for shortpayments of sales
tax. Initial focus will be on those goods outlined in ACN 97/79(Schedule 5), and also those described in ACN
98/08 (Schedules 4 &amp; 7). In addition to the collection of any shortpayments identified, Customs will be
considering the imposition of ""late payment"" and ""false statement"" penalties for shortpayments of sales tax made
in the previous three years. Concurrently with this exercise Customs is verifying the veracity of statements made
on current shipments. Shortpayments will be adjusted and ""false statement"" penalties considered.

Importers and Customs Brokers are reminded to check all import entries of goods subject to sales tax and to
ensure that the correct rate has been applied.

For information relating to the Schedule 5 review, contact Mr Jim Collins, National Business Centre (General
Business) on (07) 3835 3282. Enquiries regarding the Schedule 4 and Schedule 7 review should be directed to
Mr Robert Harkins, National Business Centre (Alcohol) on (02) 9893 4304 or Mr Phil Lane, National Business

FUEL SUBSTITUTION MINIMISATION LEGISLATION

EXEMPTION OF CERTAIN CUSTOMABLE AND EXCISABLE

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS FROM MARKING - FURTHER

INFORMATION

The fuel substitution legislation to take effect on and from 31 January 1998 requires the addition of a chemical
marker to certain petroleum products that are cleared for home consumption at a concessional or free rate of
duty. On the advice of the oil industry, the marker selected is Mortrace MP and it is to be added at a prescribed
dosage of 20 parts per million weight per volume.

As foreshadowed by Australian Customs Notice No. 98/01, it is recognised that the marker could have an
adverse effect in certain cases on the performance of the marked product or other undesirable outcomes in
certain specialised solvent applications. Customs recognises that in such cases, unmarked bulk solvents are
required.

Accordingly, Customs has put in place legislative and administrative arrangements to take effect from 31 January
1998 for the remission or refund of customs and excise duty in respect of unmarked petroleum products as
solvents to address the industry concerns where it is feared that the marker could affect the performance of the
solvent.

Availability of the benefit of the remission by users of products as solvents - Excise Regulation 50 (1) (zg)
and Customs Regulation 126 (1) (ma)

Australian Customs Notice No. 98/01 advised users of petroleum products as solvents who require unmarked
product on which remission has been given (ie supplied at a rate free of duty) to apply to Customs.

Where a valid application including the details set out in Australian Customs Notice No. 98/01 has been made
prior to or following the issue of Australian Customs Notice No. 98/01, there is no need to make any further
application.

Where the Australian Customs Service is satisfied that the application is made in terms which protect the revenue
(ie does not present an unacceptable risk to the revenue) and that the application demonstrates a prima facie
case for the unmarked solvent to be required for technical reasons, a Remission Certificate with effect 31 January
1998 will be issued to the applicant.

Initially, Remission Certificates will be issued for a period of 12 months validity. The Australian Customs Service
will invite applicants to reapply for renewal at expiry.

While at this stage, the Australian Customs Service will accept apparently reasonable claims that unmarked
solvent is required for technical reasons, supporting evidence may be required at the time of renewal.

Applications for Refund of Duty - Excise Regulation 50 (1) (zh) and Customs Regulation 126 (1) (mb)

In cases where a user does not gain access to the benefit of the remission, the new legislative arrangements also
allow for a refund of duty where the products have been used only as a solvent.

Suppliers of Bulk Unmarked Product - Requirements in Relation to Remission Circumstances

The remission of duty will only be applicable where the petroleum products are delivered into home consumption
pursuant to a permission under section 61C of the Excise Act 1901 or section 69 of the Customs Act 1901.

Existing permissions will be revised with effect from 31 January 1998 to accommodate the new arrangements. A
new condition will be inserted into permissions to require permission holders to not deliver petroleum products in
circumstances where Excise Regulation 50 (1) (zg) or Customs Regulation 126 (1) (ma) applies or where the
Permission Holder intends to apply for a remission under these regulations, unless the petroleum product is
delivered to a person or company who provides to the Permission Holder, at or before delivery of the product, a
copy of the Remission Certificate issued to that person or company by the Australian Customs Service. The

INDEXATION OF CERTAIN EXCISE AND CUSTOMS TARIFF RATES AND THE DIESEL FUEL REBATE

The provisions of section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 provide for indexation increases to rates of duty for certain excisable and like
customable goods, in February and August of each year, in certain circumstances. The increases are related to certain movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

The CPI for the December quarter 1997 was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 28 January 1998.

Sub-section 6A(5) of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 requires that the last preceding December or June index number published by the Australian Statistician be divided by the previous
highest December or June index number since December 1983 to establish a factor.

The December 1997 index number (120.0) has been divided by the December 1996 number (120.3) to establish a factor of 0.998. Sub-section 6A(4) of the Act provides that the rates of
duty will be indexed only if the factor is greater than 1. As the factor on this occasion does not exceed 1, there will be no indexation of the excise duty rates or the equivalent customs
duty rates following release of the December 1997 CPI figure.

Also, there is no change to the rates of diesel fuel rebate declared in respect of sub-section 164(5A) of the Customs Act 1901 and sub-section 78A(5A) of the Excise Act 1901. Rebate
rates can change from month to month because of the effects of indexation and the averaging provisions of the rebate legislation. The rate applicable to a particular claim is shown on
the payment advice forwarded to claimants.

Under Government policy, PBLs for items 45, 46 and 56 in Part III of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) are limited to capital equipment imported for projects with a
minimum capital equipment investment of around $10 million in imported and locally sourced items.

The prime purpose of this ACN is to clarify the Government's policy on the coverage of the expression ""capital equipment"" when assessing a PBL request. In particular, the advice in this
ACN replaces the italicised advice in paragraph 1, Section 4 of
(ACN) 96/32.

This ACN also clarifies aspects of the goods table discussed in Section 5 of
(ACN) 97/49.

The guidelines contained in this ACN will assist applicants to comply with the policy requirements for the granting of a PBL since the modifications to the PBL System were introduced on
15 July 1996. These guidelines address many of the issues raised in PBL requests received to date and are based on advice from the Government and the Department of Industry,
Science and Tourism (DIST).

2. CAPITAL EQUIPMENT GUIDELINES

2.1 General Policy

While the ordinary meaning of ""capital equipment"" may be quite broad, under Government policy, the granting of a project item PBL is restricted to a certain class of capital equipment.
This class comprises significant items of machinery (or, in certain circumstances, significant components thereof) that are integral to and used directly in industrial activities appropriate
to the particular PBL item concerned. Elements of this policy are summarised in the attached table and some aspects are explained in more detail below.

TARIFF CONCESSION ORDER (TCO) APPLICATIONS

1. Since introduction of amendments to the Tariff Concession System (TCS) on 15 July 1996, Customs has

become increasingly concerned with the inadequacy of TCO applications. The revocation of Commercial Tariff
Concession Order (CTCO) Number 8734172 - ""The Parts Bylaw"" - and subsequent lodging of TCO
applications for goods affected by the revocation, provides an opportune time to re-affirm the responsibilities of
TCO applicants.

2. The TCS permits reduction of the rate of duty specified in the Customs Tariff. While Customs accepts its

responsibility to assist all applicants through the TCO process, it cannot proceed to grant a TCO unless an
application meets the core criteria.

3. The emphasis therefore is on TCO applicants satisfying the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Customs (or his

delegate) at the outset that their goods are entitled to concessional treatment. Applicants must satisfy all
requirements of Part XVA of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act), in accordance with the instructions set out in
Volume 13 of the Australian Customs Service Manuals, for a TCO to be granted. If the CEO is not satisfied
that a TCO should be granted, the normal tariff rate will apply.

28 Day Screening Period for New Applications

4. Section 269H of the Act provides for a 28 day screening period for the delegate to be satisfied that the TCO
application meets the criteria set out in s269F and s269FA. This period allows time for the CEO's delegate to
confirm:

that the wording proposed by the applicant is acceptable;
the tariff classification of the goods,

and be satisfied that applicants have, prior to lodging the TCO application, discharged their responsibility in
establishing that local manufacturers of the TCO goods do not exist and that there are reasonable grounds for
asserting that the application meets the core criteria, viz that:

""... on the day on which the application was lodged, no substitutable goods were
produced in Australia in the ordinary course of business"".

5. The screening period is not for TCO applicants to obtain a commencement date for their TCO and, once
having established that operative date, to then have an additional 28 days in which to be assisted by the
delegate to complete their application prior to it being published in the Tariff Concessions edition of the
Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.

Requirements of the Application Form

6. A valid TCO application form must contain complete answers to all the questions at the time the application is

lodged with Customs. Incomplete or insufficient applications will be rejected.

Question One

7. The completed application form must, in respect of Question One:

a. contain a full description of the TCO goods identifying the physical features of the product. Applications

should describe the TCO goods or list what they comprise - not state what the TCO goods do.
Applications must not use terminology where the use of those terms preclude manufacture by all but the
overseas supplying company. For example, stating that a product is covered by a particular patent does
not preclude a substitutable product being produced by a local manufacturer.

Applications that use the terms 'assemblies', 'systems', 'devices', 'components', 'modules', 'mechanisms',
'preparations', 'kits', 'sets', 'units', 'parts', or similar collective terminology, without then explaining what
the assemblies, systems, etc comprise, will not be accepted;

b. where industry terms are used, provide evidence that those terms are widely used throughout the

particular industry;

c. in respect of parts, fully describe the individual parts in order that the tariff classification may be

confirmed.
The goods descriptions should relate to the parts to be covered by the TCO and not be a comprehensive
description of the complete machine with a brief reference to the parts.

CONTROLS ON TRANSBOUNDARY MOVEMENT OF

HAZARDOUS WASTE

Requirement for Permit for Export or Import of Hazardous Waste

Exporters and importers of hazardous waste need to determine whether or not they require a permit from
Environment Australia before shipments of such waste take place.

Amendments to Australia's legislation controlling international movements of hazardous waste to, from and
through this country came into effect in December 1996. This legislation regulates not only hazardous wastes
destined for final disposal (for example, by incineration or landfill), but also hazardous wastes destined for
recovery or recycling operations, even if someone is willing to pay for the waste.

The controls are detailed in the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 (the Act) as
amended in 1996. The Act enables Australia to meet its international obligations under the Basel Convention on
the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and their Disposal.

Obtaining a Permit for Export or Import of Hazardous Waste

All hazardous wastes need to be assessed by Environment Australia and permit requirements determined before
import or export takes place. Whether a waste needs a permit or not depends on several aspects, including:

the composition of the waste;
how the waste is intended to be disposed of and by which recycling/recovery operation; and
where the waste is going to, or coming from.

Environment Australia will issue permits if the person or company requesting the permit is able to satisfy this
agency that the waste will be treated in an environmentally sound manner. Additionally, for the export of
hazardous waste to be approved, no suitable recycling/recovery facilities must be available in Australia, or the
material must be required as a raw material in the importing country. The consent of the importing country is also
required. If an exporter has a permit, the permit number should be entered in the relevant field of the Australian
Customs Services' export clearance system, EXIT. Export entries containing incorrect permit numbers will not be
issued a clear Export Clearance Number by Customs.

In the case of exports, the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Codes (AHECCs) used to describe goods
requiring clearance do not align with hazardous waste categories. However, it is important that the most
appropriate AHECC is used and the description of the hazardous waste is accurate. This will enable the review of
material being shipped under permit, and the assessment of compliance with permit requirements for the export
or import of hazardous wastes.

Penalties for Export or Import of Hazardous Waste Without a Permit

It is an offence to move hazardous waste internationally without a permit when one is required.

Australian legislation provides for high penalties to apply to offences that are likely to result in injury or damage to
human health or to the environment. These penalties are up to $1,000,000 for a body corporate and up to 5 years
imprisonment for an individual. Lesser penalties apply to other offences. In addition, executive officers of
corporations may be held liable if they are found to have been negligent or reckless.

Hazardous waste exported or imported without a permit can also be returned to the country of origin under the
Basel Convention.

Further Information

Any enquiries concerning the Act should be directed to Dr Geoff Thompson (ph 02 6274 1411) or Ms Annie
Gabriel (ph 02 6274 1711) in the Hazardous Waste Section of Environment Australia.

MANUFACTURING IN BOND (MiB)

In December 1997 the Government announced the introduction of Manufacturing in Bond (MiB) as part of its
Investment For Growth industry statement. MiB will exempt exporters from duty on imported goods which are
intended for re-export or used as inputs to exports.

Firms seeking to access MiB will need to demonstrate that an important part of their business plan is to use
Australia as a base for export operations. Those goods that enter the domestic market will incur a duty liability
when the product leaves the MiB facility.

The Regulations giving effect to this scheme came into force by gazettal on 20 March 1998.

Persons or companies wishing to manufacture in bond will require approval from the Department of Industry,
Science and Tourism (DIST) and must also hold a Customs warehouse licence.

Applications to manufacture in bond should be submitted to DIST together with a detailed business plan and an
application for a Customs warehouse licence if the premises intended for manufacture are not already licensed.

When an applicant receives MiB approval from DIST, Customs will process the warehouse licence application. If
the MiB approval holder already holds a warehouse licence for the premises in which the manufacture is to take
place, the licence will automatically convert to an MiB licence.

DIST has the power to re-assess an approval at any time and to condition or withdraw it.

Detailed information on the Scheme's arrangements is available from all DIST and Customs regional offices.

All initial enquiries concerning MiB should be directed to Trevor Apolloni, DIST, Central Office ((02) 62136526).
Enquiries regarding Customs licensing can be directed to Derrick Andrews, Excise Branch, Customs, Central
Office ((02) 62756133).

PROJECT BY-LAW SCHEME (ITEMS 45, 46 and 56)

1. Introduction

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) sets out the policy and administrative criteria to be applied when processing requests for duty concessions on certain items of
imported capital equipment. It is intended to serve as a guide to the operation of the new Project By-Law Scheme. The policy and administrative requirements will
commence on 1 August 1998, being the date which the Minister for Industry Science and Tourism, and the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs announced would
be the commencement of the Project By-Law Scheme which covers items 45, 46 and 56 of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The Project By-law Scheme (PBL
Scheme) replaces what was known as the Policy By-law System. ACNs 96/32, 97/49 and 98/18 will cease to have effect from 1 August 1998.

Other Schedule 4 items previously covered by the Policy By-law System, ie items 43, 47, 52, 55, 57 and 60 are covered by ACN 98/27.

2. Background

Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) establishes the rate of duty to be paid on goods imported into Australia. The principal objective is to assist
Australian manufacturers. However, the structure of the Tariff is such that some goods not made in Australia also become subject to duty. Under certain conditions, the
Government may forgo the collection of duty on goods not made in Australia.

Sections 8 and 18 of the Tariff provide the authority for goods specified in Schedule 4 of that Act to enter at a rate below that set out in Schedule 3. The items contained
in Schedule 4 provide the legal basis for concessional entry of certain goods in prescribed circumstances.

Items 45 and 46 of Schedule 4 to the Tariff provide for concessional entry of capital equipment for use in specified industries. Item 56 of Schedule 4 provides for the
concessional entry of technologically advanced capital equipment, which is 'state of the art'.

In addition to falling within the terms of item 45, 46 or 56, the capital equipment must satisfy policy and administrative requirements before a PBL Scheme concession
will be made. This ACN sets out the criteria for the PBL Scheme.

3. Summary of Changes

The key policy and administrative changes to commence on 1 August 1998 include:

introduction of the Project By-Law Scheme which constitutes items 45, 46 and 56 of Schedule 4 to the Tariff;
new policy and administrative criteria for requests for concessional entry under items 45, 46 and 56;
removal of the requirement that the project be directed towards import replacement or export enhancement;
removal of the requirement whereby an applicant had to demonstrate that opportunities had been maximised for Australian manufacturers across the entire project;
introduction of a new requirement to advertise in national newspapers or trade journals and with relevant industry associations for expressions of supply from
Australian manufacturers;
introduction of a new requirement whereby an applicant is to provide evidence that the equipment to be imported is not produced in Australia;
clarification of an applicant's responsibility to provide the minimum amount of information (as set out in this ACN) to enable Customs to properly assess whether the
Government's policy objectives are met. PBL Scheme requests containing insufficient information will be rejected;
introduction of transitional arrangements for outstanding Policy By-law requests; and
reduction of the time frame in which PBL Scheme requests will be processed: from 30 to 25 days for a project advice and from 120 to 90 days for a goods request.

4. Overview

The PBL Scheme provides an avenue for duty relief for certain imported capital equipment for major projects, which cannot be provided from Australian manufacture.

The applicant for a PBL concession may be either the project proponent or any other party authorised in writing by the project proponent.

Applicants seeking concessional entry for goods covered by a particular PBL Scheme item will be required to lodge a detailed request with Customs. If the request
satisfies the terms of the item and the policy criteria, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Customs, or his delegate, may issue a legal instrument (by means of a by-law
or determination made under either section 271 or 273 of the Customs Act 1901) that will permit concessional entry of the goods.

Applicants should not assume that their requests would be automatically approved. Each request will be considered on its merits. In all cases, Customs will conduct an
evaluation of the request to ensure that established legal and policy criteria have been satisfied. Broadly based or unsupported assertions by applicants that equipment
is not available from Australian manufacturers will not be accepted. The new PBL Scheme places an obligation on applicants to ascertain the capacity of Australian
industry to manufacture the particular goods that they require.

Applicants should contact Customs at an early stage in order to provide details of the proposed project and to receive advice on the PBL Scheme.

5. Policy Considerations

All requests for concessional entry under the PBL Scheme will be assessed against prevailing industry policy objectives as determined by the Government. The Minister
for Customs and Consumer Affairs is responsible for the administration of the PBL Scheme. The PBL Scheme will be administered by Customs with policy decisions and
advice being provided by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST) as required.

A PBL Scheme request will be assessed against all of the policy criteria set out in this ACN and its Attachments.

6. Specific Policy Criteria

Item 45

'Capital equipment for use in the mining and resource processing industries, as prescribed by by-law.'

For the purposes of item 45, appropriate industrial activities are those which recover minerals or transform and add value to primary or natural resources within the
mining or resource processing project concerned. Primary inputs can be from recycled or waste products generated from a separate or integral industrial process.
Primary and intermediate stage resource processing activities are included. Consideration may be given to final stage resource processing or waste recycling activities
provided they are integrated with earlier stages.

Transportation activities, such as pipelines, are not eligible industrial activities. Infrastructure proposals, such as stand-alone power stations that are not dedicated to an
eligible industrial activity are not eligible for a PBL Scheme determination.

Item 46

'Capital equipment for use in the agriculture, food processing and food packaging industries, as prescribed by by-law.'

The capital equipment must be for use in an activity, which produces, transforms or adds value to agricultural or food products. Primary and intermediate stage food
processing and food packaging are acceptable activities. Final stage food processing is an acceptable activity provided that it forms part of an integrated food processing
operation.

Item 56

'Capital equipment classified under a heading or subheading in Chapter 84, 85, 86, 87 (excluding goods covered by the plan known as the Passenger Motor Vehicle
Manufacturing Plan), 89 or 90 of Schedule 3 which, in the opinion of the Minister, is technologically more advanced, more efficient or more productive than equipment
currently available from Australian manufacture, as prescribed by by-law.'

Item 56 was inserted into Schedule 4 to the Tariff to improve the international competitiveness of Australian industry. This purpose is achieved by facilitating
concessional entry of 'state-of-the-art' capital equipment where it can be demonstrated that the equipment has higher performance characteristics than equipment
manufactured in Australia. A PBL Scheme concession under item 56 requires that there is equipment currently made in Australia against which a suitable comparison
can be made.

Project By-Law (PBL) Scheme ATTACHMENT A

Project By-Law (PBL) Scheme

1. Capital Eqiupment Guidelines

1.1 General Policy

While the ordinary meaning of 'capital equipment' may be quite broad, under Government policy, a Project By-law (PBL) Scheme concession is restricted to a certain class of capital
equipment. That class of capital equipment comprises significant items of machinery (or, in certain circumstances, significant components thereof) that are integral to and used
directly in industrial activities appropriate to the particular item concerned. Elements of this policy are summarised in the attached table and some aspects are explained in more
detail below.

1.2 'Significant'

PBL consideration will be given to significant items only, that is, items of considerable importance. This is to ensure that the resources of both applicants and Customs focus upon the
areas of greatest benefit to the activities intended to be assisted by the PBL Scheme.

As a guide, a number of factors may be taken into account when determining whether equipment is significant for the purposes of the PBL Scheme. They include value, importance
to the project, specificity of design, complexity and dimensions. These and other factors should be addressed in combination. It is unlikely that any one factor will demonstrate that the
equipment is significant. Goods such as nuts, bolts, screws, gaskets, connectors and cables will not be considered significant for the purposes of the PBL Scheme.

1.3 '...items of machinery'

Machinery and goods identifiable as components thereof are generally classified within Chapters 84, 85, 86, 87, 89 or 90 of Schedule 3 to the Tariff. Equipment classified elsewhere
is generally not considered to be capital equipment for the purposes of the PBL Scheme. Goods classified outside these chapters (for example a sub-sea flexible flow line) may still
be considered to be an item of machinery if the goods consist of highly complex interactive parts, are specifically designed for use in the relevant industry, and require only simple
assembly to form a complete item.

1.4 '...integral to and used directly in...'

Only equipment integral to and for direct use in appropriate industrial activities is eligible for PBL consideration. Equipment which is ancillary to the project (including but not limited to
office equipment and equipment used in activities such as land preparation, road and building construction, personnel accommodation and transportation, off-site transportation and
the provision of electrical, water, telecommunications and other general services) is excluded from consideration.

1.5 '...industrial activities appropriate to the ...PBL Scheme item...'

Item 45

For the purposes of item 45, appropriate industrial activities are those which recover minerals or transform and add value to primary or natural resources within the mining or resource
processing project concerned. Primary inputs can be from recycled or waste products generated from a separate or integrated industrial process. Primary and intermediate stage

Project By-Law (PBL) Scheme ATTACHMENT B

DETAILED SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

Introduction

This attachment details the submission information requirements that applicants must address when lodging a Project By-law Scheme request. It should be read in conjunction with the
ACN and Attachment A.

The PBL Scheme request process is in two distinct but interlinked stages:

Stage 1 - project advice; and
Stage 2 - goods request.

Stage 1

The project advice stage information requirements are primarily addressed in sections six to nine in the ACN and paragraphs 1.1 to 1.6 of this attachment.

Stage 2

The goods request stage includes the more specific requirements of items 45, 46 or 56, which are addressed in paragraphs 2.1 to 2.6 of this attachment. When lodging goods requests,
applicants must cross-reference each separate goods request to the parent project. A goods request may be lodged either with or following lodgement of the project advice.

A PBL Scheme determination will only be granted following Customs consideration of the goods request, which covers particular goods in the form that they are imported.

Format of Requests

The format of the project advice should follow the headings and details outlined in Stage 1 - project advice details. Similarly, each particular goods request format should follow the
headings and details outlined in Stage 2 - goods request.

STAGE 1 - PROJECT ADVICE (PA) DETAILS

1.1 PA1 - Applicant and Representative Details

The applicant for a PBL concession may be either the project proponent or any agent authorised in writing by the project proponent.

The project proponent or an authorised representative should provide the following detail, about the project proponent, the authorised representative and associated importers as
applicable:-

name;
address;
contact name, telephone and facsimile details;
owner code (if applicable);
Australian Company Number; and
written authority for the authorised representative to act on behalf of the project proponent

1.2 PA2 - Project Outline

The applicant's comprehensive description of the project should address the following issues:

information the applicant considers relevant to the request, for example, details of any meetings with Customs or the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST), including
whether Major Project Facilitation status has been accorded by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism or previous advice given by Customs in relation to the request;
detailed information identifying the overall scope and dimensions of the project, including total value of the project and planned timing (company documents such as board
submissions, shareholder advice and annual reports will lend weight to descriptions of the project);
description of the project, including major works;
description of mining, resource processing, food processing or manufacturing processes, including where the goods fit into a process (for example, a process flow chart);
details of proposed purchases, and shipping schedule if available; and
provide a copy of the public advertisement for the project.

1.3 PA3 - Value and Origin of Capital Equipment

The applicant should provide a list of all capital equipment to be used in the project. This list must clearly differentiate between domestic and imported equipment and provide the
Australian dollar value of all the equipment. This information is used to assess the eligibility against the $10 million threshold.

POSTAL ENTRY THRESHOLD

The cost recovery suite of legislation, which commenced by Proclamation on 1 April 1997, included a component
which amended paragraph 68(1)(e) of the Customs Act. The amendment reduced the threshold for an entry in
relation to goods consigned by the post from $1,000 to $250. The amendment had a delayed commencement
date and was due to take effect on 1 April 1998.

In August 1997 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit ('JCPAA') commenced an inquiry into internet
commerce. The inquiry includes a consideration of the appropriateness of the existing entry thresholds as
expressed in subsection 68(1) of the Customs Act and the implications, costs and benefits of any alteration to
these thresholds. In light of the mid -1998 reporting timeframe of the JCPAA it was not appropriate to proceed
with the change to existing thresholds until Government has had sufficient time to consider the findings on this
issue.

The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 1998 has provided for the removal of the proposed
entry threshold reduction. This has the effect of leaving the postal entry threshold at $1000. The Government will
consider the JCPAA findings and accordingly the issue of entry thresholds when the report is finalised.

NEW UNIFORM FOR CUSTOMS

Introduction of a new official clothing range for Customs Officers is nearing completion. The Northern Territory,
South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia and Victoria are wearing the new clothing, and New
South Wales and the ACT will change over in June 1998.

Customs has undergone significant changes in the past few years and the new uniform and corporate wardrobe
reflect the modern approach that has been adopted by the organisation.

Customs officers involved in border operations at international airports, cargo and waterfront areas throughout
Australia will wear a distinctive blue and grey uniform. This makes them easier to identify, especially in areas
where there is a variety of uniformed staff from other organisations. A new corporate wardrobe will be worn by
staff in commercial and corporate areas, providing a new and professional appearance commensurate with
Customs' roles in industry assistance and trade facilitation.

The numbered gold-coloured metal badge worn with the old uniform is not part of the new uniform, and will not be
used as a form of identification once the changeover is completed. Customs is reviewing identification
arrangements for staff and further advice will be issued once this is finalised. In the interim, staff can be formally
identified by plastic number or name badges which carry the Customs crest, and a Customs photo identification
card. Uniformed officers are required to wear their new name or number badge at all times when on duty.

Specific policy criteria for item 47

Item 47 in Schedule 4 to the Tariff reads:

47. Goods as prescribed by by-law, being machinery that incorporates, or is imported with, other goods which

render the machinery ineligible for a current Tariff Concession Order made under Part XVA of the Customs Act
1901.

Item 47 was created to compensate for shortcomings in the earlier Commercial Tariff Concession Scheme
(CTCS) in relation to certain capital equipment for use in the mining, construction and agricultural sectors. These
shortcomings were largely overtaken by the implementation of the Tariff Concession System (TCS) in 1992.
Unlike the TCS, the CTCS provided a capacity for manufacturer of parts to object to the granting of a concession
for whole goods.

Item 47 of Schedule 4 to the Tariff allows for the entry of complete capital equipment at concessional rates where
a Commercial Tariff Concession Order (CTCO) has been granted which excludes certain original components that
could be made in Australia. This enables importers of such equipment to avoid having to remove components
excluded by a CTCO and shipping those components separately or obtaining them locally, in order to obtain the
benefit of the concession for the balance of the equipment. At the time of commencement of this ACN, a duty rate
of 3% applies to item 47.

Applicants seeking an item 47 concession should provide a submission in accordance with the General request
procedures outlined in the body of this ACN.

Specific policy criteria for items 43 and 52 ATTACHMENT A

Items 43 and 52 in Schedule 4 to the Tariff read:

43. Goods, as prescribed by by-law, being original components of machinery classified under a heading or sub-

heading in Chapter 84, 85 or 90 of Schedule 3.

52. Original components of complete equipment classified under a heading or subheading in Chapter 86, 87 or 89

in Schedule 3, as prescribed by by-law.

Items 43 and 52 provide for tariff treatment of split consignments of complete equipment. These items were
established to overcome a situation where tariff treatment of split consignments of complete equipment resulted in
the application of more duty to the individual components than would apply if the same goods had been imported
as a complete unit.

To be eligible for concessional entry under item 43 or 52 without requiring the CEO to make a decision under
section 271 or 273 of the Customs Act, the goods must meet the terms of either standing by-law 9640116 or
9640117 respectively, which reflect the policy intent of these items. A Customs Regional Office at the port of entry
will generally determine requests for concessional entry under items 43 and 52. If exceptional circumstances
arise that are considered to fall outside the terms of the standing by-laws, the Customs Regional Office may refer
the matter to Central Office in Canberra for consideration.

A significant pre-condition for access to a concession under item 43 or 52 is that the goods concerned must be
ordered from, and shipped by, a single supplier. The goods must be available as an identifiable, whole entity at
the place of manufacture or export. Split shipments from different suppliers in different locations are not eligible
for concessional treatment under these items. This concession is not intended to apply to such generic or notional
entities as complete plant, greenfield or civil engineering projects.

Broadly, concessional entry of goods under item 43 or 52 is only available where:

there are unavoidable alterations in the manufacture, certification or transportation of the goods causing the
importer to import the components in separate consignments for example, because of the size of the goods or
because certain sensitive but integral components must be transported by air); or

circumstances arise beyond the control of the importer, such as inadvertent transport or shipping delays,
which preclude shipment on a single vessel or aircraft.

The concession does not apply to replacement parts, components or spares used in modernising or refurbishing
existing machinery or equipment. Initial spare parts, maintenance tools and the like that may be supplied as part
of an original shipment do not constitute original components.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/1998-27-b.pdf,Specific policy criteria and additional administrative requirements for item 57,"Australian Customs Notice 1998 27 B

ATTACHMENT Specific policy criteria and additional 
administrative requirements for item 57

Item 57 of Schedule 4 to the Tariff reads:

57. Raw materials and intermediate goods, as prescribed by by-law, classified under heading 5903 or within

Chapter 28, 29, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39 or 48 of Schedule 3 and in the opinion of the Minister, have a substantial
and demonstrable performance advantage, in the production of a specific end product, over substitutable
goods produced in Australia.

Item 57 of Schedule 4 to the Tariff was introduced by the Government to allow the concessional entry of a range
of raw materials and intermediate goods (consisting of chemicals, plastics and paper used in the production of
certain products) where, in the Minister's opinion, the imported goods offer a substantial and demonstrable
performance advantage in the production of a specific end product over substitutable goods produced in
Australia.

To meet the legal and policy requirements of item 57, applicants must demonstrate that the goods to be imported:

are a raw material or an intermediate good

offer a substantial and demonstrable performance advantage in producing a specific end product over
substitutable goods produced in Australia

are classified to heading 5903 or within a Chapter specified in item 57; and

are used in the production of a specific end product which is directed towards export enhancement or import
replacement activities.

The terms of item 57 require that the Minister must form an opinion that the imported goods have a substantial
and demonstrable performance advantage in the production of a specific end product over substitutable goods
produced in Australia, before the delegate can consider issuing a determination. Customs needs to ensure that
sufficient information is available to the Minister to enable an informed opinion to be made on the matter.

The principal means of assessing the degree of significant and demonstrable performance advantage is by
means of an independent technical assessment that must accompany each item 57 request. Customs is likely to
consult with potential Australian suppliers, manufacturers or representative industry groups to validate the claims
made about the perceived advantages of the imported goods.

Factors that will be taken into account when assessing the 'substantial and demonstrable performance
advantage' include, but are not limited to:

greater production efficiency, including reduced processing time, fewer production steps, lower capital costs,
lower operating costs, improved yield, reduced energy usage

superior physical or chemical properties, including improved strength, durability or flexibility

compliance with Australian or international standards; and

any other pertinent characteristics that demonstrate a significant commercial advantage (other than relative
cost) compared to suitable locally available materials.

Applicants should note that eligibility for concessional entry under item 57 is confined to goods which are inputs to
a manufacturing process undertaken in Australia. Processing which does not alter the essential nature or use of
the goods is not sufficient to warrant concessional treatment. Simple cutting, shaping, wrapping or similar
processes which do not alter the essential character of the imported good are not sufficient to satisfy the industry
policy intent of the item. The performance advantage must be quantifiable, and must arise from the use of the raw
material or intermediate good in the production of the specific end product.

Applicants should be aware that a concession will only be granted where, for the purposes of an independent
technical assessment, the applicant has nominated Australian produced goods which appear suitable for use in

Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 (the Act) - Late Lodgement of

Return Of Factory Cost (RFC) - Administrative Appeals

Tribunal (AAT) Decision

A decision of the AAT - Unisys Australia Pty Ltd (No 12797 of 15 April 1998) has fundamentally changed the
interpretation of sub-section 16 of the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984(the Act), in respect of the six months time
limit prescribed for the lodgement of Return of Factory Cost (RFCs) - form B 330.

The AAT has found that ss16 imposes a strict time limit on bounty claimants to lodge RFCs within six months of
the end of an accounting period.

Sub-section 16(1) states:
""A manufacturer of bountiable equipment shall, within six months after the end of each accounting period of the
manufacturer that falls, or part of which falls, within the bounty period, furnish a return setting out particulars of
the factory cost incurred by the manufacturer in relation to bountiable equipment manufactured in that accounting
period by the manufacturer.""

The decision clearly puts an end to Customs long-standing administrative practice of accepting RFCs after expiry
of the prescribed six months time limit and continuing to process them.

The AAT's decision means that RFCs lodged more than six months after the close of an accounting period are
not valid and any claim to additional computer bounty will have lapsed.

A further impact of the AAT's decision is that the penalty prescribed for late lodgement of an RFC may be
imposed, subject to a manufacturer's capability of complying with the time limit.

RFCs already lodged with Customs before 20 May 1998, even though lodged outside the time limit prescribed in
ss16(6), will continue to be processed. Customs however, may require manufacturers to explain the reason for
late lodgement in assessing whether prescribed penalties are payable.

on (02) 6275 5805.

ACCESS TO COMPILE VIA THE INTERNET

Customs is now in a position to offer access to COMPILE via the Internet. This provides an alternative to the current leased line access and will be available to users from 20 July 1998.

For an importer or Customs Broker to lodge a Customs entry electronically and thereby attract the lower Customs administrative charges, the importer/broker would need to access the
Customs COMPILE system. To access the COMPILE system, an importer/broker would need to have installed a dedicated line at their premises at a cost of $5500.

The only other alternative to the dedicated line is to communicate with the COMPILE system using the Electronic Data Interchange system known as EDIFICE. This entails the user
building or purchasing specialist Customs broking software.

It was recognised that these were not always cost effective options for small business. As such, in conjunction with Tradegate ECA, Customs will now provide access to the COMPILE
system via the Internet.

Tradegate Internet Service

Security of Customs COMPILE system was a major consideration in the setting up of the service. As a result, Tradegate through its Internet Service Provider AT&T, will be the only
service provider. AT&T have set up a Virtual Private Network to ensure that communications between the user and Customs are secure and accessible at local call charges nationwide.
There are no separate Internet charges to access this service.

The service will provide full COMPILE functionality. However it will not provide general Internet capability.

Costs and Charges

To connect to this service, users make a local phone call and will be charged the Customs cost recovery fee together with the Tradegate ECA fee per entry, as are all importers/brokers
using Customs COMPILE system.

The only other cost to be borne by the user is a one off cost for the software. The cost of this software is $350 and is only available from AT&T.

Registration and Connection

Users must sign a COMPILE User Agreement with Customs and receive user codes prior to having an Internet connection established.

For new users a summary of the registration process is outlined below.

Send a fax to the Customs User Liaison section in your State requesting to be registered as a COMPILE user.
User Liaison will mail out a COMPILE Registration package.
The user fills out the various forms and returns them to User Liaison.
User Liaison forwards relevant forms to Tradegate, AT&T and Customs Canberra.
AT&T configures the user and advises user of details.
Customs Canberra allocates user codes and sends to User Liaison.
User collects user codes from User Liaison.

Existing COMPILE users will already have an agreement with Customs and simply need to apply for the Internet connection by stating this fact in a fax. User Liaison will then only send
the forms necessary to establish the Internet connection.

The full registration process may take up to four weeks.

ATTACHMENT - Australian Customs Dumping Notice - 98/030

This report concerns a review of the anti-dumping measures imposed on exports to Australia of Expandable Polystyrene (EPS) from Korea. Anti-dumping measures
have been in place against EPS exported from Korea since August 1992. The measures were extended for another five years in November 1997.

The Customs Act provides for reviews of the dumping duty where it can be shown that variable factors that are used to calculate the duty have changed. The factors
are the normal value and the non-injurious free-on-board prices.

Following an application by the Australian manufacturer of EPS, Huntsman Chemical Company Australia Ltd, this review was initiated on 25 February 1998. Huntsman
requested a review of normal values for Korea. Customs extended the review to cover non-injurious free-on-board prices from Korea.

Part of Huntsman's request claimed that because styrene monomer the major raw material input into EPS, and EPS, are traded globally in US dollars it would make
more sense to have normal values ascertained in US dollars rather than Korean won. They also asked that the normal value be backdated to October 1997, the period
prior to the currency devaluation. During the review Huntsman asked Customs to consider the fact that the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar
had undergone a ""sustained movement"".

The issues were considered during the review and it was concluded that the legislation does not allow Customs to accede to Huntsman's requests.

Customs invited and received submissions from interested parties on the current levels of normal values and non-injurious free-on-board prices and verified the main
claims made during the course of company visits.

From its review inquiries, Customs found that the level of both normal values and non-injurious free-on-board prices for exports of EPS from Korea have altered since
they were last reviewed. Accordingly, Customs recommends that the ascertained amounts for these variable factors be revised.

GASOLINE

Excise Tariff Notice No. 4 (1998) and Customs Tariff Notice No. 3 (1998), published in Special Commonwealth
Gazette No. S225 of 21 May 1998, detail alterations proposed to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and Customs Tariff
Act 1995 to apply new rates of Excise and Customs duty to aviation gasoline.

It is proposed that the rates of duty will be reduced by 2.6 cents per litre, from 17.403 cents per litre to 14.803
cents per litre, effective from 25 May 1998.

The reduction in the rates of duty on aviation gasoline applies to that component of the duty previously paid to

be subject to revised funding arrangements.

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION - TRADE MARKS

ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under section 132 of the Trade Marks Act
1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to them, or in relation to
them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force
for a period of two years from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in
Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade
mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain
objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it
has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice
regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final
paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is
substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to be seized by
Customs, unless it can be established that:

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or
the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not,
amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions
of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially
identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.

The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish
to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each
State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of
Objection, or Customs' role in regard to those Notices, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and
Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs Service Office in their nearest capital city.

SALES TAX EXEMPTION CHANGES

The Australian Taxation Office has undertaken a review of a number of aspects of sales tax administration. In order to improve the integrity of claims made for the exemption of sales tax,
a number of changes to the treatment of sales tax exemptions on import entries are to be introduced.

Importers will now have to be more explicit when claiming an exemption from sales tax and two new methods are to be introduced to achieve this end. The first is the Sales Tax
Exemption Item number and the second is the Exemption Declaration.

Sales Tax Exemption Item

When claiming an exemption from sales tax, the importer will have to quote a Sales Tax Exemption Item number. A list of the item numbers is at Attachment A. Certain item numbers are
designated with an ""R"" which indicates a restriction. The importer must then also quote a Sales Tax Registration Number (certificate).

A new field will be introduced to the COMPILE system to cater for the Sales Tax Exemption Item number. This field will be known as the STE. Importers will be able to quote the STE at
either the header or line level, using any of the following methods:

Where importers are passing sales tax liability on and quote a Sales Tax Registration Number, they must input the Sales Tax Registration Number prefixed with an R/ as is the case
now; or
When an importer quotes an STE coupled with a Sales Tax Registration Number, the STXC or STX field will contain only the Sales Tax Registration Number; or
Where the goods in question are Australian returned goods, the importer must quote AUG in the STE field.

With the introduction of the STE field the EX, CX and RCX options will be removed.

Exemption Declarations

Exemption declarations can be quoted where the importer does not hold a Sales Tax Registration Number. These declarations are listed at Attachment B.

The exemption declaration must be prefixed with an R/ when used with a restricted STE, and in such instances may only be used at the line level.
Where an exemption declaration 2 (ED2) is quoted, a STE must also be quoted.

Any amendments made to entries after 1 September that were created prior to 1 September must comply with the new rules.

Implementation

These changes will come into effect on 1 September 1998.

SALES TAX ACCREDITATION FOR COMPUTER GOODS

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is undertaking a major project to combat sales tax fraud in the personal computer industry. A new Part 7A has been added to the Sales Tax
Assessment Act 1992 which introduces significant changes to the administration of sales tax on computers and related goods.

Importers of such goods will no longer be able to quote an exemption item to import Part 7A goods tax free and will need to be accredited by the ATO in order to import computer goods
free of sales tax.

The ATO will issue each accredited importer with a Sales Tax Accreditation Number (STAN). This accreditation number will be linked to an importers owner code and the information
provided to Customs by the ATO. Importers wishing to gain accreditation should contact the ATO Helpline listed at the end of this notice.

When an importer makes an entry for Part 7A goods, the accreditation number as well as their valid Sales Tax Registration Number (STX), or certificate, is required. The Customs
COMPILE system will check that the accreditation number is valid for the owner of the goods as stated on the entry.

Goods that fall within the ambit of the accreditation mechanism will be determined by their corresponding tariff item and statistical key. A detailed listing will be published prior to 1
September 1998. If an importer does not have an accreditation number then sales tax of 22% must be paid.

A COMPILE Newsletter will be distributed soon which will outline how users will input the Sales Tax Accreditation Number (STAN) into Customs import entries.

Implementation

These changes will come into effect on 1 September 1998.

Polymeric plasticisers, namely Reoplex GL and Diolpate 195,

exported to Australia from the United Kingdom

On 6 April 1997, the Australian Customs Service (Customs) initiated an investigation following an application
lodged by Townsend Chemicals Pty Ltd (Townsend), the Australian manufacturers of polymeric plasticisers of the
saturated polyester adipate type (polymeric plasticisers), for a dumping duty notice in respect of polymeric
plasticisers, namely Reoplex GL and Diolpate 195, exported to Australia from the United Kingdom.

During the course of the investigation, it was determined that Reoplex GL was not a polymeric plasticiser of the
adipate type but rather a polymeric plasticiser of the phthalate type. Customs considered whether Reoplex GL
and the Australian product Re-Plas 333 were like goods and it was determined that although Reoplex GL and Re-
Plas 333 have different production inputs, the two can be used for the same purposes and achieve similar end
results. Also, Reoplex GL was specifically included in the application for anti dumping duty submitted by the
Australian industry.

Customs examined the Australian market and imports over the period July 1996 to May 1998, for the purpose of
making a preliminary finding.

Based on the evidence available, Customs concluded that:

Reoplex GL has been exported to Australia from the UK at dumped prices;
Diolpate 195 has been exported to Australia from the UK at dumped prices;
the Australian industry has suffered material injury;
the material injury has been caused by exports of Reoplex GL and Diolpate 195 from the UK to Australia at
dumped prices; and
material injury to the Australian industry will continue from imports of Reoplex GL should provisional measures
not be imposed on these imports.

Customs found that there are sufficient grounds for the publication of a dumping duty notice in respect of Reoplex
GL exported from the UK, and for the publication of a dumping duty notice in respect of Diolpate 195 exported
from the UK.

Securities will be imposed in respect of any interim dumping duty that may become payable on Reoplex GL
imported from the UK on or after 1 July 1998.

Customs will now refer the matter to the Anti-Dumping Authority which must hold an investigation and report to
the Minister within 110 days on whether interim dumping duty should be imposed.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/1998-38.pdf,Removal of tariffs on certain inputs to the manufacture of information industries equipment - item 65,"Australian Customs Notice 1998 38

Removal of tariffs on certain inputs to the manufacture of information industries equipment - item 65

1. Background

On 8 December 1997, the Prime Minister, the Hon John Howard MP, announced as part of the Investing for Growth Industry Statement that the Government would remove tariffs on
certain inputs to the manufacture of information industries equipment. After consulting with local suppliers to assess the likely impact on them, the Government's initiative was
incorporated in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1998), which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 14 May 1998. The changes are operative from 1 July 1998.

The Proposal changes Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to bring forward the phasing of duty rates introduced for the Information Technology Agreement (see Australian
Customs Notice (ACN) 97/50) with exclusions for goods which are considered to be complete goods (see Attachment C to this ACN).

The Proposal also creates Item 65 in Part III of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995.

Item 65 provides for the duty free entry of:

""Goods the subject of a Commercial Tariff Concession Order or a Tariff Concession Order, the number of which is as prescribed by by-law, that
are inputs to the manufacture of information industries equipment, as prescribed by by-law"".

This concession applies to inputs that are subject to a current Commercial Tariff Concession Order (CTCO) or Tariff Concession Order (TCO). Duty free entry will apply to goods
covered by CTCOs and TCOs the numbers of which are prescribed for the purposes of Item 65.

This ACN provides information to assist importers and their representatives to correctly enter goods under Item 65.

2. Coverage of Item 65

Item 65 covers goods, being inputs, that are an integral part of the manufacturing process for information industries equipment. Goods that are incorporated into the equipment or
consumed during the manufacture of the equipment are covered by the Item. In addition, capital equipment utilised in the manufacturing process is eligible for concessional entry
under Item 65.

This measure is intended to assist the manufacture of information industries equipment in Australia. It is recognised, however, that other sectors may also benefit if they use goods
that will be covered by this Item. To contain the impact to the area of the Government's policy intent (manufacture of information industries equipment) inputs should be either:

a. used principally in the manufacture of information industries equipment in Australia; or
b. if used more widely, represent a significant cost component in the manufacture of information industries equipment in Australia.

Item 65 coverage does not extend to handtools, such as crimping tools, wire stripping pliers, torque screwdrivers etc which, whilst used in the manufacture of information industries
equipment, and have a CTCO or TCO, do not comply with the definition of inputs set out above.

Information industries equipment is that equipment listed by tariff classification in the by-law prescribed to Item 65. This list of information industries equipment is derived from the
Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and a report released by the Industry Commission in 1996 titled Mapping the Information Industries.

3. Eligibility for Item 65

To be eligible to use Item 65, goods must be covered by a current CTCO or TCO that is listed in the prevailing by-laws applicable to Item 65. At the time of preparation of this Notice
Customs By-law Number 9840015 prescribed the following CTCO and TCO numbers:

Importers will be advised of their entitlements based on Australian Customs Service records of clearances for
home consumption during the 23 months ended 31 May 1998. Letters advising importers of their allocation for the
period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 will be dispatched later this month.

Transfer of Base Quota Allocation form, which are available from Customs Information Centres. Completed
applications should be sent to:
Industry Development

working days to complete. This time is suspended when it is necessary to return an incomplete or incorrect form,
and resumes when the application is returned. Applications should be submitted well in advance of intended use.

REVOCATION OF COMMERCIAL TARIFF CONCESSION

ORDERS AND TARIFF CONCESSION ORDERS ON

INFORMATION INDUSTRIES EQUIPMENT

On 12 May 1998, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon John Moore, announced that the
Government was to bring forward, to 1 July 1998, the removal of tariffs on the majority of goods covered under
the Information Technology Agreement. The agreement produced a list of goods in the information industries on
which tariffs were being phased to zero by 1 January 2000.

As a result of the Government's decision, a large number of commercial tariff concession orders (CTCOs) and
tariff concession orders (TCOs) are to be revoked and will not be available after 30 June 1998.

From 1 July 1998 onwards, importers are advised to exercise caution in using Item 50 or Item 50A of Schedule 4
to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 when importing goods in the information industries that are the subject of a CTCO.
An importer should use Item 50 or Item 50A to enter only those goods which attract a rate of tariff duty other than
free.

Enquiries concerning this Notice may be directed to Mr John Arndell, Director, Tariff Concessions Section, on (02)

AMENDMENTS TO THE CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED EXPORTS)

REGULATIONS

LIFTING OF UN SANCTIONS AGAINST SIERRA LEONE:

On 24 December 1997, new prohibitions under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations were introduced on
the exportation of petroleum and petroleum products and paramilitary equipment and spare parts intended for
Sierra Leone.

The United Nations Security Council, by Resolution No.1156 of 16 March 1998, has since decided to lift the
sanctions relating to petroleum and petroleum products. The Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations were
amended to give effect to this Resolution by Statutory Rules 1998 No. 211 which were notified in Special Gazette
No. S327 of 1 July 1998. The amendment was operative from 1 July 1998.

The existing prohibitions on the exportation of paramilitary equipment and spare parts to Sierra Leone are,
however, unaffected and remain in place.

Any enquires on this matter should be directed to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
on (02) 6261 2291.

TECHNICAL AMENDMENT:

Statutory Rules 1998 No. 211, as published in Special Gazette No. S327 of 1 July 1998, also corrected an error in
the definition of petroleum as defined in subregulation 13CE(5). The term ""hydrogen sulphate"" has been replaced
with the term ""hydrogen sulphide"".

DECREASE IN EXCISE AND CUSTOMS DUTY ON AVIATION

GASOLINE

Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 (1998) and Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 (1998), introduced into the House of
Representatives on 30 June 1998, detail alterations proposed to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and Customs Tariff
Act 1995 to apply new rates of Excise and Customs duty to aviation gasoline (avgas).

The alterations reduce the avgas duty by 13.092 cents per litre, from 14.803 cents per litre to 1.711 cents per litre,
effective on and from 1 July 1998.

The reduction applies to the component of the duty previously paid to Airservices Australia for the cost of
providing terminal navigation services to the general aviation sector. In future, revised funding arrangements are
to apply for such services.

Tariff pages to be issued in connection with these changes are:

Excise - E84 (R.5) &amp; E85 (R.5)

RELATING TO ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES NOTIFICATION OF

FINDING IN THE REVIEW OF NON-INJURIOUS FREE-ON-

BOARD PRICES OF CLEAR FLOAT GLASS EXPORTED FROM

THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

In Australian Customs Dumping Notice 98/013 of 18 March 1998, the Australian Customs Service (Customs)
notified the commencement of a review of non-injurious free-on-board prices (NIFOBs) applying to exports of
clear float glass (CFG) from the People's Republic of China (China).

Customs has completed its review. The Summary and Recommendations of the review report (98/007) is
attached.

The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs has accepted Customs recommendations and has re-ascertained
NIFOBs for two Chinese exporters. The notice signed by the Minister was published in the Australian
Government Gazette on 6 August 1998. The re-ascertained NIFOBs will not be published as this may adversely
affect the business or commercial interests of certain interested parties. The new levels apply to CFG entered for
home consumption on and after 6 August 1998.

Bona fide importers of the goods subject to the review may obtain details of the re-ascertained NIFOBs by
contacting the Cargo Facilitation Branch in their respective capital cities.

A copy of the report will be sent to all interested parties that participated in the review. Requests for copies of the
report may be directed to the Trade Measures Branch, Canberra on telephone number (02) 6275 6057. Any other
inquiries may be directed to Graham Cruttenden on telephone (02) 6275 6014 or facsimile (02) 6275 6990.

1. SUMMARY &amp; RECOMMENDATIONS

Summary

In 1992 anti-dumping measures were imposed against clear float glass (CFG) exported to Australia from the
People's Republic of China (China). The measures have since been reviewed three times. In 1997 the measures
were extended for a further five years.

On 26 February 1998, George Fethers &amp; Co Ltd (Fethers) requested a review of non-injurious free-on-board
prices (NIFOBs) applying to Guangdong Float Glass Co., Ltd (China) (GFG) and Dalian Float Glass Co., Ltd
(China) (DFG). Customs initiated a review, of NIFOBs applying to all exports of CFG from China, on 18 March
1998.

Customs invited submissions from all interested parties but received submissions only from the applicant and
from local industry. Customs visited the applicant and industry to verify information and also visited several glass
merchants and further processors of glass to obtain market information.

Customs concluded that industry's selling prices are being achieved in a market no longer affected by dumping
and used those prices as the basis for ascertaining revised NIFOBs.

CUSTOMS YEAR 2000 IT EXTERNAL TESTING

In September 1997, Customs
issued ACN 97/70 outlining Year 2000 issues, testing and compliance processes
that would affect Customs information technology (IT).

In that ACN, as well as in
two subsequent letters sent to major clients, Customs stated that a testing
service would be made available from September 1998 for external users to test
for Year 2000 compliance.

Testing is now expected to
commence early in 1999. A further Customs update on external testing process
will be issued in December 1998 in an ACN and on the Customs Website ,
which provides useful information on Customs progress with IT compliance, including
EDI message formats.

It is anticipated that Customs
core systems will be fully compliant in June 1999, in line with recommended
Commonwealth Government guidelines, allowing for time to remedy any remaining
problems.

Customs is liaising with your
industry association on Customs Y2K IT issues and any enquiries should be directed

WAREHOUSE LICENCES - Renewal and payment of fees for 1998-99 (Part V of the Customs Act
1901)

Warehouse licences for 1997-98 expired on 30 June 1998. Licences may be renewed upon submission of a written application for renewal, together with payment of the fees, to the
relevant office of the Australian Customs Service. Due to delays in determining and obtaining approval for the warehouse fees for 1998-99, the cut-off date for lodgement of renewal
applications and payment of fees has been extended to 29 July 1998.

Review of Warehouse Licence Fees

Warehouse licence fees are reviewed annually in order to recover the costs of administering the warehouse licensing system. The 1998 review also considered initiatives such as:

the introduction of the Customs Cost-Recovery System in April 1997;
Customs greater emphasis on self-assessment and risk-assessment when dealing with clients; and
the need to ensure that the charging structure for new undertakings, such as the recently approved Manufacturing in Bond scheme, is consistent with cost-recovery principles.

As a result, the fee structure has been changed to reduced flat fees for new licences and renewed licences, with no additional charges for specific types of warehouses and no
reductions for computer-based accounting and recording systems. Other aspects, such as the facility for quarterly payments and the pro-rata fees for new licences issued after 1 July,
will continue.

In future, warehouse licence fees will be reviewed twice a year as part of the current price review process for all cost-recovery charges. This will ensure that charges continue to be
commensurate with the costs of administering the warehouse licensing system.

Fees for 1998-1999

The Customs Regulations have been amended, with effect from 1 July 1998, to prescribe warehouse licence fees for 1998-99 as specified below.

New warehouse licence fee

Warehouse licence renewal fee

Lodgement of Application for Renewal and Payment of Fees

$7,000

$4,000

Applications for renewal of warehouse licences are to be made on the form supplied to licensees together with remittance of the appropriate fees. Licensees will receive confirmation of
the fees for 1998-99 and of the date by which they must be paid.

Where fees remain unpaid beyond the specified date, the licence may be suspended and the premises may not be used for warehousing goods subject to Customs control.

Further Information

For further information concerning warehouse licensing or the fee structure please contact the Warehouse Licensing Clerk in the Customs office in the capital city of the State or Territory
in which the warehouse is located.

SECTION 77G DEPOTS PROVIDING CARGO TERMINAL

OPERATOR SERVICES FROM OFF-AIRPORT SITES

This Notice outlines the conditions under which Customs will consider applications from those Section 77G depot
applicants who are intending to provide cargo terminal operator (CTO) services from off-airport sites.

Currently, both on-airport CTO service providers and off-airport depot operators are licensed to deliver specific
cargo services in accordance with Section 77G of the Customs Act 1901.

For the purposes of this Notice, off-airport CTO services are those activities delivered on behalf of an airline in
accordance with the terms of a contract and which include the specific regulatory responsibilities of report,
breakdown, check-in, underbond movement and acquittal of imported cargo.

It should be noted that a number of other services such as ramp, refuelling, and baggage handling which are
generally provided by on-airport CTO service providers, are not regarded as material when considering the merits
of an application to provide CTO services from an off-airport site.

Supplementary conditions governing the delivery of CTO services from an off-airport depot site

An applicant seeking to provide CTO services from an off-airport site must firstly meet the requirements for grant
of a Section 77G depot licence, and secondly demonstrate a capacity to meet and maintain a range of
supplementary conditions, specified in accordance with Section 77Q.

The supplementary conditions apply only to depot applicants who are seeking the authority to provide CTO
services from off-airport sites. The supplementary conditions are:

1. the applicant must be a person, company or partnership that is a licensed Section 77G depot operator or is

simultaneously applying for a Section 77G licence;

2. the applicant must be in a position to occupy and control the intended premises of operation;

3. the applicant must hold a current contract with an international airline to provide CTO services at the airport of
application [shared contractual arrangements may be considered, however in the case of freighters it must be

DECLARATIONS UNDER SUBSECTION 132B(1) OF THE

CUSTOMS ACT 1901 AND SUBSECTION 59A(1) OF THE

EXCISE ACT 1901 - TOBACCO PRODUCTS

The Chief Executive Officer has decided to exercise his power under Section 59A of the Excise Act 1901 and
Section 132B of the Customs Act 1901 to allow quotas to be imposed on the entry into home consumption of
tobacco products during a declared period prior to excise and customs duty anticipated rate increases in August
1998. Attached is a copy of the Gazette notices setting out the declared periods and the base periods. The
notices set out the particular goods which are affected.

The effect of the arrangements is that persons may enter goods up to quota during the declared period at the
rates of duty existing at the time. Any product entered during the declared period in excess of the quota will
attract duty at the rate in force on the day immediately following the last day of the declared period. Quota will be
based on products entered during the base period.

In instances where entries are lodged for tobacco products during the declared period and no quota has been
issued, Customs will determine whether a quota is appropriate and if so issue a quota order.

Any enquiries on these arrangements should be directed to Peter Holt on (02) 6275 6103.

ANTI-DUMPING AUTHORITY CONTINUATION INQUIRY -

CLEAR FLOAT GLASS FROM THAILAND

The Anti-Dumping Authority has advised the Australian
Customs Service of the following which is reproduced below for information.

'The Anti-Dumping Authority has completed its
inquiry into whether dumping duties currently applying to exports to Australia of clear
float glass (CFG) from Thailand (except for exports from Bangkok Float Glass Co Ltd)
should be continued beyond their scheduled expiry date of 29 September 1998.

The Authority was not satisfied that the expiry of the
duties would lead, or be likely to lead, to a recurrence of the material injury which the
duties were intended to prevent.

Accordingly, the Authority recommended to the Minister
that he take no action to continue the dumping duties.

The Minister has accepted the Authority's
recommendation and, as a consequence, the dumping duties will expire on 29 September 1998.

Copies of the non-confidential version of the
Authority's Report no. 191 will be available in due course. Inquiries for copies
should be addressed to the Information Officer, Ms Margaret McLeod, at the Authority on
telephone (02) 6213 6754 or email MMCLEOD@dist.gov.au.'

GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE -

REIMBURSEMENTS - REVIEW OF PROCEDURE

Customs has reviewed the procedures for application of reimbursement of an overpaid administrative charge. As
stated in Australian Customs Notice 90/124, the Customs Act provisions relating to refunds, remissions, rebates
and drawback of duty paid do not apply to the administrative charge.

Procedures for the reimbursement of the administrative charge are currently set out in ACS Manual Volume 7
(3/21). These procedures have been reviewed as a result of the introduction of the Financial Management and
Accountability (FMA) Act 1997.

Under the previous Audit Act, Commonwealth departments / bodies and authorities were able to apply for a
reimbursement of any overpaid administrative charge that had been paid. As the Audit Act has been repealed
and replaced by the FMA Act, it is now appropriate for the Customs to establish new procedures for these
payments. Reimbursements of the administrative charge will be processed under s.28 of the FMA Act.

From 1 August 1998, applicants will need to apply for reimbursement to the Refunds Section in the region in
which the goods were imported for reimbursement of overpaid administrative charges. These applications may
NOT be made through the COMPILE system, as the administrative charge is not a customs duty. Therefore,
applications will need to be made in writing. Applications will be considered and paid through the regional
Customs office.

Applications for reimbursement will also need to be made within 12 months of the date of payment of the
administrative charge. This will ensure that applications are in line with refund applications made under s.163 of
the Customs Act and the Customs Regulation (r.128A)

Any enquiries about this Notice should be directed to Helen Jeffs, Senior Inspector Refunds, Cargo Facilitation,
Canberra on (02) 6275 6047.

INDEXATION OF CERTAIN EXCISE AND CUSTOMS TARIFF RATES OF DUTY AND THE DIESEL FUEL
REBATE

Section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (the Excise Tariff) and section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 provide for indexation increases to rates of excise and customs duty for certain
excisable and like customable goods in February and August of each year in certain circumstances. The increases are related to movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). As a
result of CPI movements during the 1998 June quarter, there has been an increase in the rates of excise and customs duty on spirits, beer (except ""home brew""), tobacco and most
petroleum products on and from 1 August 1998. The new rates of duty are set out in Table 1 (excise duty) and Table 2 (customs duty) of the Attachment to this ACN.

The CPI for the June quarter 1998 was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 22 July 1998. Subsection 6A(5) of the Excise Tariff requires that the last preceding June index
number published by the Australian Statistician be divided by the previous highest December or June index number since December 1983 to establish a factor. When this factor is
greater than 1, it is used to calculate the new rates of excise and customs duty applying to the relevant excisable and like customable goods in accordance with subsection 6A(4) of the
Excise Tariff.

The June 1998 index number (121.0) was divided by the December 1996 number (120.3) to establish a factor of 1.006; hence the increases in the rates of duty.

In accordance with long-standing policy, where rates of excise and customs duty are indexed in the above circumstances, complementary increases in the rates of diesel fuel rebate are
also made. These increases are effected by declarations under subsection 78A(5A) of the Excise Act 1901Customs Act 1901. The new declared rates of diesel fuel rebate are also
effective on and from 1 August 1998 and are listed in Tables 3 and 4 of the Attachment.

Actual rates of rebate payable can differ from these declared rates because of the averaging provisions of the rebate legislation. The rate applicable to a particular claim is shown on the
payment advice forwarded to claimants.

CUSTOMS BROKERS LICENSING ENTRY OF GOODS FOR

CUSTOMS PURPOSES

Recently the National Customs Agents Licensing Advisory Committee reported to the Chief Executive Officer that
a nominee customs broker, while in the employ of a corporate customs broker, illegally acted in his own right and
entered goods for Customs purposes, for another corporate customs broker's clients thereby breaching
s.s.183CG(2) of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act).

All customs brokers, in particular nominee customs brokers, are reminded that they should be fully aware of the
relevant provisions of the Act as they relate to the entry of goods for Customs purposes and should carefully
observe the conditions attached to their licences.

In particular the attention of nominee customs brokers is drawn to the fact that they are not permitted to act in
their own right as they are employed by either corporate or sole trader customs brokers to enter goods for those
brokers' clients only.

Customs brokers are also reminded that relevant s.181 (of the Act) authorities must be obtained from their clients
in order for them to legally enter goods for Customs purposes on their clients' behalf.

Any enquiries regarding the content of this Australian Customs Notice should be directed to Mr John Cullen,

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS

ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act
1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to them, or in relation to
them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force
for a period of two years from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in
Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade
mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain
objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it
has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice
regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final
paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is
substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to be seized by
Customs, unless it can be established that:

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or
the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not,
amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions
of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially
identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.

The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish
to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each
State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of
Objection, or Customs' role in regard to those Notices, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and
Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs Service Office in their nearest capital city.

TARIFF REDUCTIONS - MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC GOODS

OF CHAPTER 90 CUSTOMS TARIFF NOTICE NO. 6 (1998)

On 24 June 1998, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon John Moore released the
Government's decision in relation to Industry Commission Report No. 56 titled ""Medical and Scientific Equipment
Industries"" of 20 December 1996. The Government has decided that customs duty on goods classified under tariff
headings 9011 to 9033 inclusive will be reduced to Free from 1 September 1998, with the exception of goods
covered by the Passenger Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Plan (PMVMP). The general rate of duty on goods
covered by the PMVMP within those headings will remain at 15%.

Customs Tariff Notice No. 6 (1998), which was published in Special Commonwealth Gazette No. S 405 of 17
August 1998, implements that decision.

To implement the decision it was necessary to alter the tariff structure of many of the subheadings between
headings 9011 and 9033 so that relevant goods covered by the PMVMP will remain dutiable at 15%, whilst other
goods are reduced to Free. For example, gauges which were previously classified in 9026.80.10 would have
covered both PMVMP goods, and for other motor vehicles such as motor cycles, trucks etc, which are not
included in the PMVMP. As the Government's decision is that non-PMVMP goods within the subject tariff
headings should be duty free, gauges for motor cycles, trucks etc will be classified to the new duty free
subheading of 9026.80.80. A concordance of tariff subheadings is attached to assist importers and their brokers
in classifying goods under the revised structure.

Tariff reprint pages issued in conjunction with this tariff change are:-

90/13 (R.1), 90/15 (R.3), 90/17 (R.2), 90/19 (R.1), 90/21 (R.3), 90/23(R.5), 90/25 (R.4) and 90/27 (R.3).

Any queries in relation to the tariff structure or the rates of duty should directed to Ray Banvill on 02 6275 6516.

NEW CUSTOMS AND EXCISE REGULATIONS -

CONCESSIONAL DUTY ARRANGEMENTS FOR CERTAIN

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN

SHALE OIL NAPHTHA PRODUCERS

The Excise Regulations 1925 (""the Excise Regulations"") have been amended to provide for new concessional
duty arrangements for certain petroleum products and to clarify the scope of two existing provisions. Where
identical considerations apply to imported product, the Customs Regulations 1926 (""the Customs Regulations"")
have been amended similarly. The Excise Regulations have also been amended to provide for payments to
certain shale oil naphtha producers.

Details of the amendments follow.

Recycled products

Statutory Rules 1998 No. 274 amended the Excise Regulations and introduced the following new regulations:

New Excise Regulations 50(1)(zk) and (zl) provide for a remission/refund of excise duty on unmarked dutiable
recycled waste oil where it is blended with an unmarked petroleum product having characteristics specified in
Excise Regulation 50(4A), on which a remission of excise duty is payable or has been paid, where the blend is
for use, or has been used as a fuel otherwise than in an internal combustion engine.

New Excise Regulations 50(1)(zm) and (zn) provide for a remission/refund of excise duty on unmarked
dutiable recycled waste oil where it is blended with fuel oil where the blend is for use, or has been used as a
fuel otherwise than in an internal combustion engine.

New Excise Regulations 176(2)(w) and (x) are consequential amendments to Excise Regulation 176 to ensure
that the above blends do not become subject to the provisions of the Excise Act 1901 (""the Act"") and
the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (""the Tariff Act"") which impose excise duty on blends of petroleum products which
do not contain the chemical marker.

Packaging of duty paid petroleum products for use as a solvent

Statutory Rules 1998 No. 277 amended the Excise Regulations and introduced the following new regulation:

New Excise Regulation 50(1)(zo) provides a new refund circumstance where duty has been paid on a
petroleum product that:

is a clean fuel (which has the meaning given to it by subsection 4(1) of the Act); and
is classified to item 11 or 12 of the Schedule to the Tariff Act; and
has been packaged, after delivery into home consumption, into a package of not more than 210 litres
capacity; and
has been sold, so packaged, for use as a solvent.

New Customs Regulation 126(1)(mc) introduced by Statutory Rules 1998 No 278 provides a refund
circumstance complementary to Excise Regulation 50(1)(zo) where duty has been paid on imported petroleum
products that fall within a classification in heading 2707, 2709 or 2710 of Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act
1995 (""the Customs Tariff Act"") (these classifications relate to hydrocarbon products that can or could be used
as solvents).

Exemption from blending duty in certain circumstances

Statutory Rules 1998 No. 277 also amended Regulation 176 of the Excise Regulations by modifying two of the
unmarked blends, which are exempt from the blending legislation.

Excise Regulation 176(2)(h) has been amended to exclude from the exemption blends of petroleum products
and octane enhancing products which fall within a classification in item 11 or 12 of the Schedule to the Tariff
Act, if locally produced, or to heading 2707, 2709, 2710 or 2902 of Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act, if

Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No.1) 1998 (Act No. 73/1998) which received Royal Assent on 30 June 1998,
incorporates Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (1998) which created Item 64. The Item became operative on and

goods to be imported into Australia duty free, by non-Australian Olympic and Paralympic Family members for use
in, or for purposes related to an event listed in paragraphs (a) to (d) of Item 64 of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff
Act 1995.

Goods that qualify for entry under this concession are for non-commercial use and include such items as give-

RENEWAL OF CUSTOMS AGENT AND CORPORATE

CUSTOMS AGENTS LICENCES

All Customs Agents Licences and Corporate Customs Agents Licences on issue expire on 31 December 1998.
Subsection 183CJ(1) of the Customs Act 1901, (the Act), provides for the renewal of licences.

As in previous years ""Application for Renewal of Customs Agents Licence"" will be distributed to all Customs
Agents and Corporate Customs Agents currently licensed with Customs. Current licence holders wishing to
renew their licences should make written application by completing their ""Application for Renewal of Customs
Agents Licence"" form and forwarding to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or a Regional Director on or before
c.o.b. 31 December 1997. Payment of the renewal fee should accompany the renewal application.

It should be noted that failure to renew a licence by c.o.b. 31 December 1998 will render the licence invalid. This
will mean that individuals or corporate bodies who have not renewed their licences by that date, but who still wish
to be licensed, will be required to make a new application to the CEO. Following receipt of the new application the
CEO, pursuant to section 183CB of the Act, will forward the application to the National Customs Agents Licensing
Advisory Committee (NCALAC) which will be required to report to the CEO as to whether the applicant should be
licensed.

Fees in respect of the renewal of a customs agents licence are to be paid not later than the day on which the
renewal of the licence is to come into force (Customs Regulation No.160). The fee payable (Customs
Regulation 158) in respect of the grant or renewal of a customs agents licence is:

1. where the customs agent is a natural person who does not intend to act, at any time when the licence is in

force in his/her own right - $20; or

2. in any other case $200.

In order to facilitate the processing of the ""Application for Renewal of Customs Agents Licence"" forms by
Customs, licence holders intending to renew their licences, are requested to complete their renewal form and
lodge it, together with the respective fee well before 31 December 1998.

Corporate Customs Agents are also requested to include with their application form:

1. a list of all nominees currently employed with their agency; and
2. a list of all persons currently having authority to direct the nominees of the agency for the purposes of the Act.

In relation to this request Corporate customs agents are reminded that, in accordance with ss183CG(3) of the
Act, it is a condition of their licence that the CEO be advised within thirty (30) days of a change of nominees,
persons authorised to direct nominees or composition of a partnership.

Distribution of Renewal Notices

The ""Application for Renewal of Licence"" will be forwarded directly to the last known address of the licensee. The
licensee will then be responsible for presenting the completed renewal application and the payment of the licence
fee to the CEO or a Regional Director.

Payment of Licence Fee

The licence fees can be paid by either:

1. mailing the completed renewal form and a cheque payable to the ""Australian Customs Service"" to:

Secretary
National Customs Agent Licensing Advisory Committee
Australian Customs Service
5 Constitution Avenue
CANBERRA ACT 2601

2. presenting the completed renewal form and payment to the cashier at your local Customs House.

If the payment is made via mail the licence will be forwarded to the licensee as soon as possible after the
processing of the payment through the ""Revenue Collection System"".

CUSTOMS TARIFF ACT 1995 SCHEDULE 4 - ITEM 42 - VESSEL CONSTRUCTION, MODIFICATION
AND REPAIR

1. Introduction

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) provides guidance to importers who seek to use item 42 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) to obtain concessional entry of
goods.

Schedule 3 to the Tariff establishes the rate of duty to be paid on goods imported into Australia. Sections 8 and 18 of the Tariff provide the authority for goods specified in Schedule 4 to
the Tariff to enter at a rate below that set out in Schedule 3. Goods to which item 42 of Schedule 4 to the Tariff applies, are therefore eligible for duty free entry.

2. Background

Item 42 is intended to provide assistance to the Australian ship building industry by reducing input costs to shipbuilders. Item 42 reads:

""Parts of vessels, and materials, for use in the construction, modification and repair of vessels exceeding 150 gross construction tons as defined in the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989.""

In accordance with subsection 4(3) of the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989, the number of tons in the gross construction tonnage of a vessel shall be ascertained in accordance with the formula:
Z / 2.83

where Z is a number equal to the number of cubic metres in the total volume, measured in relation to their moulded lines, of the enclosed spaces in the vessel, including between-deck
spaces, water ballast spaces, voids, cofferdams, machinery spaces, erections, superstructures, houses, casings, funnel spaces, mast spaces and, in the case of an air-cushion vehicle,
the area enclosed by the inflatable skirt under normal inflation.

3. Guidelines

In order to gain concessional entry under item 42, importers must demonstrate that the goods are:

1. parts of vessels, or materials; and

2. for use in the construction, modification or repair of vessels.

In administering the entry of goods under item 42, Customs will construe the terms of that item according to the guidelines set out in this ACN.

""Vessels""

A vessel for the purposes of item 42 is a vessel which exceeds 150 gross construction tons. The number of tons in the gross construction tonnage is ascertained using the formula
provided in the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989, set out on the first page of this ACN. Such a vessel would:

normally be classified in Chapter 89 of the Tariff, other than heading 8907 or 8908

operate in the marine environment; and

generally have the characteristic of being navigable, irrespective of how this is achieved.

DECLARING GOODS TO BE EXPORTED FROM DIFFERENT

CONSIGNORS NOTICE TO EXPORT SERVICE INDUSTRY

Background

Some companies in the export service industry are offering services to their clients known as 'assembly services'.

Assembly services may be described as follows:

An overseas consignee, that is, the person or organisation that takes final physical possession of the goods,
orders goods from a number of different companies in Australia. For example, an overseas consignee fitting out a
shop orders cash registers from one consignor, clothing racks from another consignor, signage from yet another
consignor, and so on. The exporter/freight forwarder, acting as the middle agent in Australia, includes their own
name on one export declaration as the owner of all the goods and ships all goods under one Airway Bill/Bill of
Lading, with the intention of receiving one Export Clearance Number (ECN) from Customs.

This service does not satisfy the requirements of s.114 and s.114A of the Customs Act 1901 ('the Act') for export
entries and information and documents relating to export entries.

Definition of owner

While the definition of 'Owner' in the Act includes persons with some control over, or right to, the goods, it is the
intention of an export entry to record the details of the 'common law' owner of the goods, that is, the consignor.

Users of Customs' Export Integration (EXIT) system are therefore to declare whether they are the 'Owner' or the
'Agent acting on behalf of the Owner' by completing the 'Owner/Agent' field as outlined in the EXIT User Manual.
Hence:

If the user is the owner of the goods to be exported, input 'O';

If the user is acting as an agent on behalf of the owner, input 'A'.

The EXIT User Manual also provides the following instruction for completing the 'Owner Name' field:

If the user is not the owner of the goods (i.e. an agent) input the owner's name.

Consequently, for the purposes of an export entry, the details to be entered in the 'Owner Name' field are to be
that of the consignor.

Following these instructions will ensure that the common law owner of the goods is clearly identified in an export
entry as the consignor.

Correct procedure

Those currently involved in the activity of 'assembly services' as outlined above are to discontinue the practice of
'assembling' goods from different owners and obtaining only one ECN for these assembled goods.

This is because the agent acts on behalf of each of the common law owners and there are separate contracts of
sale for the goods between the consignors (the common law owners) in Australia and the consignee overseas.

The correct procedure is for the agent to obtain an ECN for each consignor and all of these ECNs must be
manifested.

For those in the export service industry wanting to provide assembly services for their clients, it is recommended
that they compile a sub-manifest of the various consignments.

Please direct any queries concerning this notice to Asha Murphy on (02) 6275 6168.

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS

ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act
1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to them, or in relation to
them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force
for a period of two years from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in
Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade
mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain
objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it
has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice
regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final
paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is
substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to be seized by
Customs, unless it can be established that:

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or
the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not,
amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions
of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially
identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.

The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish
to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each
State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of
Objection, or Customs' role in regard to those Notices, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and
Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs Service Office in their nearest capital city.

COMPILE USER CREATION OF CODED OWNER AND
SUPPLIER (COS) CODES

In June 1996 the Australian Customs Service made the Coded Owner and Supplier (COS) code creation facility 
available to registered COMPILE users enabling those users to create COS codes from their own office 
COMPILE terminal.

This facility has proven to be a valuable saving of time and effort for COMPILE users as well as a resource saving 
for the ACS itself. It is of some concern however that COS code allocation data has in some instances not been 
of a good quality nor have all entries been created using correct COS codes. This initially appears to be due to a 
combination of failure of some COMPILE users to take due care in the COS allocation and/or entry creation 
process as well as some performance problems within the COS software itself.

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice is to remind COMPILE users of their responsibility to correctly 
create COS codes and import entries. It further advises industry of the commencement of a Customs review of 
the COS system which focuses on the COS allocation system software and industry's COS business 
requirements.

COS codes

The import entry process requires two COS codes for each entry. One code identifying the owner of the goods
(Owner Code) and one identifying the supplier of the goods (Supplier Code). The ideal situation is that the COS 
system holds only one current COS code per owner or supplier.

In respect of owner codes, there are 4 types of code that apply to the entry process:

Owner code types are:

Government
Diplomatic
Business
Individual/Partnership (not being a business)

There is only a single type of supplier code.

COS Allocation Process:

Government and Diplomatic codes can only be allocated by the ACS. All applications for Government or
Diplomatic COS code MUST be made by the COMPILE user to the appropriate ACS regional office.

For Business and Individual/Partnership COS codes, COMPILE users are able to create codes directly from their
own terminal.

Upon receipt of relevant commercial documentation and prior to the creation of a Customs entry, the registered
COMPILE user should ideally consult internal office records to see if COS codes for the entry owner and supplier
already exist. If so, COMPILE users must use the existing COS codes on the entry. (In certain situations the COS
system may have made a code 'non-current'. In this case the COMPILE system will advise that fact during the
entry creation process).

If no COS code is found, the COMPILE user may then attempt to create a new code. Likewise, if an existing COS
code proves to be 'non-current' at the time of entry creation a new COS code may be created.

The COS allocation process will compare the input data with existing COS records and where matching details
exist, the system will return a message to the screen advising the number of an existing COS code. If the input
data does not correspond with an existing COS record, the system will allocate a new COS code. This new code
is to be used on the entry.

COMPILE users may find benefit in including the new and existing codes in their internal records for future
reference.

The new forms, B443(9/98), B444(9/98) and B441(9/98), take effect from the date of gazettal which was 9
December 1998.

The major amendment to form B443(7/96) - ""Application for a Tariff Concession Order (TCO)"", is the inclusion of
the suggestion, at Question 5, that an applicant for a TCO should allow local manufacturers at least 10 working
days to respond to inquiries concerning local manufacture.

The major amendment to the other two forms is the request, at Question 6, that a local manufacturer provides
information to support its calculations of local content.

While the new forms are operative from 9 December 1998, Customs will continue to accept the current forms,
B443(7/96), B444(7/96) and B441(7/96), until Friday, 29 January 1999. This will ensure that people have
sufficient time to obtain and start using the new forms.

From Monday, 1 February 1999, Customs will accept applications for a TCO, submissions objecting to the making
of a TCO and requests for revocation of a TCO only on the new forms.

NOTICE OF OBJECTION SECTION 135 OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT 1968

The operation of the Customs seizure provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 (""Copyright Act"") was outlined in Australian Customs Notice 95/31 of 15 June 1995.

The following company, having declared itself to be the owner of the copyright material identified below, has given Notice under Section 135 of the Copyright Act. By this action, the

Notices of Objection to Importation Trade Marks Act 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act
1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to them, or in relation to
them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force
for a period of two years from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in
Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade
mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain
objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it
has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice
regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final
paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is
substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to be seized by
Customs, unless it can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of
trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or

- the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not,
amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions
of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially
identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.

The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish
to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each
State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of
Objection, or Customs' role in regard to those Notices, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and
Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs Service Office in their nearest capital city.

Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 6 to 10 (1998)

On 24 November 1998, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr. Peter
Slipper MP, tabled the above Proposals in the House of Representatives.

Section 226 of the Customs Act 1901 allows the tabling of Customs Tariff Proposals in the House of
Representatives to propose alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. These Proposals must be incorporated
into the Tariff Act within twelve months of tabling in the Parliament. Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 3, 4 and 5
(1998) were tabled in the House of Representatives during May and June 1998. However, at the time Parliament
was prorogued for the Federal Election on 31 August 1998, the Proposals had not been incorporated into the Act
and therefore lapsed.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 6 (1998)

This Proposal re-introduces the alterations previously contained in Proposal No. 3 (1998) which reduced to Free
the rate of duty for certain inputs to the manufacture of information technology equipment with effect from 1 July
1998. Details of these changes were outlined in ACN 98/35.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 6 provides two additional alterations to those contained in Proposal No. 3 (1998). It
accords a Free rate of duty for proximity cards of subheading 8543.81.00 and for electrical machines with
translation or dictionary functions of subheading 8543.89.10 with effect from 1 July 1998. These alterations were
notified in the Commonwealth Gazettes of 7 and 22 July 1998 as Customs Tariff Notices Nos. 4 and 5
respectively.

Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 7 and 8 (1998)

These Proposals re-introduce reductions in the rate of duty on aviation gasoline of

2.6 cents and 13.092 cents per litre that were tabled in the House of Representatives on 3 and 30 June 1998
respectively - see ACNs 98/31 and 98/46. These reductions retain their original operative dates of 25 May and 1
July 1998.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 9 (1998)

This Proposal introduces into Parliament alterations previously notified in the Commonwealth Gazette of 17
August 1998 as Customs Tariff Notice No. 6. It reduces to Free rates of duty on goods classified in headings 9011
to 9033, inclusive, of Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995, with the exception of goods covered by the
Passenger Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Plan, with effect from 1 September 1998. The changes were previously
outlined in ACN 98/66.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 10 (1998)

This Proposal contains two technical changes that will take effect from 1 January 1999. The first of these changes
provides a Free rate of duty for shoulder pads used in clothing through a new subheading 6217.90.30. The other
alteration amalgamates subheadings 8543.89.10 and 8543.89.90 into new subheading 8543.89.00.

No new Tariff Reprint pages for the alterations contained in Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 6 to 9 (1998) will be
issued as they were despatched when the original pre-election changes were made. Pages to be issued for
Proposal No. 10 (1998) are 62/41 (R.1) and 85/43 (R.4). They will be released with the half-yearly Australian
Bureau of Statistics changes in mid-December.

A concordance of tariff subheadings affected by Proposal No. 10 (1998) is attached to this Notice.

Introduction of the Euro

From 1 January 1999, eleven members of the European Union (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany,
Luxembourg, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) will adopt a single currency, the euro, which will
be legal tender for non-cash transactions. The Reserve Bank of Australia has advised that on 31 December 1998
there will be a fixing between the euro and the national currency units of each of these eleven countries. The
resultant rates will become the irrevocable exchange rates that will be used to convert the so called ""legacy
currencies"" to the euro. Legacy currencies can still be used during the euro transition period which runs from 1
January 1999 to 31 December 2001.

From 4 January 1999, the first working day after the introduction of the euro, the Reserve Bank will provide
Customs with the exchange rate for the euro against the Australian dollar. This rate will be used to determine the
ruling rate of exchange for the euro against the Australian dollar which will be included in the
weekly Gazette notice of ruling rates of exchange published in accordance with section 161J of the Customs
Act1901.

The ruling rates of exchange for legacy currencies will continue to be published and included in Customs
reference files. These rates will be determined taking account of the fixed rates for the legacy currencies against
the euro and the daily average selling rate of the euro against the Australian dollar. The fixed rates to be used for
this purpose will be notified in an Australian Customs Notice early in January 1999.

The ruling rates of exchange for the euro will be added to Customs reference files from 5 January 1999 and will
be denoted as EUR.

For the purpose of lodging entries in COMPILE, importers should continue to enter the value of goods in the
currency specified on the commercial invoice. If the invoice is in a legacy currency that currency should be
entered - the amount should not be converted into euros and then entered. Similarly, where invoices specify a
value in euros the euroamount should be entered.

For EXIT entries, the currency to be quoted in the ""Invoice Currency Code"" field should continue to be the
currency specified on the commercial invoice, including legacy currencies where applicable. The euro will be
added as a valid currency for this field.

For technical reasons the euro cannot be accepted as a valid currency in the ""FOB Currency"" field in EXIT until
changes to the system and to the software of EXIT users have been implemented. It is expected that these
changes will be made in early February 1999. This will be the subject of a further Australian Customs Notice.

Any queries on the valuation aspects of this Notice should be directed to Ms Lee Deegan, Director, Valuation on
telephone (02) 6275 5610. COMPILE/EDIFICE queries may be referred to Mr Ray Carter on (02) 6275 6423 and

Customs Year 2000 IT External Testing

In September 1998, Customs issued ACN 98/47 indicating that an external testing service would be provided early in 1999 for Year 2000 issues.

It must be emphasised that the testing can only be undertaken when both external users and Customs have achieved their own Year 2000 preparedness. Customs staff will begin
contacting users directly in January to advise on prerequisite conditions and to schedule such testing.

There will be no change in EDI message formats - either for input or for output from the Customs systems.

Testing is planned to start mid-March, and the schedule is:

MONTH

March

April

May

July

DAY/S

Saturday

FUNCTION

Users would need to negotiate with Customs if they want to conduct testing on designated Public Holidays.

External testing will give users confidence that their business with Customs will continue to operate on any given date in the Year 2000. Customs will not be in a position to assess user
problems if they occur.

This approach will allow an orderly management of the very large number of users who are expected to participate.

RELATING TO ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES FINDING ON WOVEN

POLYPROPYLENE PRIMARY CARPET BACKING FABRIC

EXPORTED FROM BELGIUM, COLOMBIA, THE KINGDOM OF

SAUDI ARABIA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA

The
 Australian Customs Service has completed its investigation into
the alleged dumping of woven polypropylene primary carpet
backing fabric (the goods) exported to Australia from Belgium,
Colombia, the Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and
the United States of America.

Customs
concluded that:

there
have been exports of the goods from each of the countries at
dumped prices;
the
 Australian industry has suffered injury;
dumped
imports have caused material injury to the Australian industry
producing like goods; and
material
injury would continue to be caused to the Australian industry
if the goods continue to be exported to Australia at dumped prices.

Customs
therefore recommended to the Minister that anti-dumping action
be taken against imports of the goods from the named countries.

The
 Minister accepted Customs recommendations. Measures apply to goods
entered for home consumption on or after 9 December 1998, being
the date from which securities were imposed by Customs.

A
 full copy of the report (No. 1) will be sent to those parties
who made submissions to the inquiry. Copies are available on request
from the Office Manager, Trade Measures Office Management, Australian
Customs Service, Canberra, telephone (02) 6275 6057 or facsimile

Indexation of Certain Excise and Customs Tariff Duty Rates and the Diesel Fuel Rebate

In accordance
with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs
Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer (except
""home brew""), tobacco and certain petroleum products will change on and from 2
February 1999.

For this indexation, the provisions require the December 1998 index number published by
the Australian Statistician to be divided by the previous highest December or June index
number to determine the factor used to index the rates of duty. Accordingly, the December
1998 number (121.9) has been divided by the June 1998 number (121) to establish the
indexation factor of 1.007.

In accordance with long-standing policy, where rates of excise and customs duty are
indexed in the above circumstances, complementary increases in the rates of diesel fuel
rebate are also made. These increases are effected by declarations under subsection
78A(5A) of the Excise Act 1901 and subsection 164(5A) of the Customs Act 1901.
It is proposed that new declared rates of diesel fuel rebate will be notified in the
Commonwealth Gazette GN 6 of 10 February 1999. Upon gazettal, the proposed new
declared rates will also be effective on and from 2 February 1999, and are listed in
Tables 3 and 4 of the Attachment.

Actual rates of rebate payable can differ from these declared rates because of the
averaging provisions of the rebate legislation. The rate applicable to a particular claim
is shown on the payment advice forwarded to claimants.

CUSTOMS ACT 1901 - PART XVB APPLICATION FOR

DUMPING DUTIES: UNCOATED WHITE CUT REAM COPY

PAPER EXPORTED FROM FINLAND

The
 Australian Customs Service has completed its investigation into the alleged dumping of uncoated white cut ream
copy paper exported to Australia from Finland. This investigation excluded A4 size copy paper exported by UPM-
Kymmene Corporation in Finland which is already subject to anti-dumping measures. The findings of Customs
are detailed in Trade Measures Report No.4.

Customs found that there have been exports of A4 size copy paper from Finland at dumped prices and that this
caused material injury to the Australian industry. Although A3 copy paper has also been exported
to Australia at dumped prices, Customs considers the volume insufficient to cause material injury to the Australian
industry.

Accordingly, Customs recommended to the Minister that anti-dumping action be taken against exports of A4 copy
paper from Finland by all exporters (other than UPM-Kymmene Corporation). Customs also
recommended that no anti-dumping action be taken against exports of A3 copy paper from Finland.

The Minister has accepted Customs recommendations and dumping duties apply to goods entered for home
consumption on or after 21 December 1998. This being the date on which securities were imposed by Customs.

A printed version of Trade Measures Report No.4 will be available shortly. A copy of the summary page from the
Report is attached.

A copy of Report No. 4 - which includes details of the dumping margins and the methods used to assess those
margins - will be sent to each of those parties who made submissions to the investigation. Copies are available

The normal values, export prices and non-injurious prices reveal  confidential details of the companies concerned

The Chief Executive Officer has decided to exercise his power under Section 59A of the Excise Act 1901 and
Section 132B of the Customs Act 1901 to allow quotas to be imposed on the entry into home consumption of
tobacco products during a declared period prior to excise and customs duty anticipated rate increases in

out the particular goods which are affected.

The effect of the arrangements is that persons may enter goods up to quota during the declared period at the
rates of duty existing at the time. Any product entered during the declared period in excess of the quota will
attract duty at the rate in force on the day immediately following the last day of the declared period. Quota will be
based on products entered during the base period.

In instances where entries are lodged for tobacco products during the declared period and no quota has been
issued, Customs will determine whether a quota is appropriate and if so issue a quota order.

Any enquiries on these arrangements should be directed to Tony Free on (02)6275 6980.

CUSTOMS ACT 1901 - PART XVB CONTINUATION INQUIRY:

A4 COPY PAPER EXPORTED FROM BRAZIL, GERMANY AND

SOUTH AFRICA

The Australian Customs Service has
completed its inquiry into whether dumping duties currently applying to exports of A4 copy
paper from Brazil, Germany and South Africa should be continued for a further five years.
The findings of Customs are detailed in Trade Measures Report No. 3.

Customs found evidence of continued
dumping from the nominated exporters in South Africa and Germany. Customs is satisfied
that the expiration of the dumping duties would lead - or would be likely to lead - to a
continuation, or a recurrence, of the dumping and the material injury that the measure is
intended to prevent.

Customs was not satisfied that the
expiration of the dumping duty on exports to Australia by the nominated exporter in Brazil
would lead to a recurrence of the dumping and the material injury that the duty is
intended to prevent.

Accordingly, Customs recommended that the
Minister:

take no action to continue the dumping duty on exports by
the nominated exporter in Brazil;
continue the dumping duties on A4 copy paper exported to
Australia by the nominated exporters in South Africa and Germany; and, if agreed
request Customs to initiate a review under s.269ZA(3) of
the Customs Act of the dumping duties to be continued because one or more of the
variable factors has changed.

The Minister has accepted the
recommendations.

INVESTIGATION INTO THE ALLEGED DUMPING OF LINEAR

LOW DENSITY POLYETHYLENE FROM THE REPUBLIC OF

INDONESIA, THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, MALAYSIA AND

SAUDI ARABIA

The Australian Customs Service has initiated an investigation into an application lodged by Orica Australia Pty
Ltd, for a dumping duty notice in respect of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) exported to Australia from
Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.

The application alleges that the goods have been exported to Australia at prices less than the normal values and
that the dumping has caused material injury to the Australian industry through:

price depression/undercutting;

reduced profits and effect on profitability; and

lost sales and effect on market share

The public version of the application, available to interested parties on request, contains the basis of the alleged
dumping.

The goods under investigation are linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), in a pelletised form and with a
density of less than 0.94 grams per square centimetre, in various grades classified within subheading 3901.10.00,
statistical code 01 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and a rate of duty of 5%.

A notice under subsection 269TC(4) of the Customs Act 1901 advising initiation of this investigation was
published in the Australian Financial Review on 16 February 1999. Interested parties are invited to provide written
submissions in response to that notice.

In its investigation, Customs will examine exports to Australia of the goods under consideration from 1 January
1998 onwards for dumping analysis. Customs will examine details of the Australian market after 1 January 1997
for injury analysis.

In reaching its findings Customs must consider whether:

1. the export price of like goods that have already been exported to Australia is less than the normal value of

those goods; and

2. the export price of like goods that may be exported to Australia in the future may be less than the normal value

of the goods; and

3. because of that, material injury to the Australian industry producing like goods has been caused and is likely to

continue.

located within Australia should address their submission to:

Pursuant to s. 269ZHI, the Minister has granted an extension of twenty-eight days for the publication of the
statement of essential facts. The statement of essential facts sets out the facts on which the CEO proposes to
base the recommendations to the Minister.

The statement of essential facts will now be placed on the public record on or before 30 March 1999. Customs
will make every effort to publish the statement at an earlier date if possible.

Interested parties are invited to make submissions to Customs in response to the statement of essential facts

ACN 98/88 outlined the introduction of the new European currency and included procedures for Customs clients

from that date.

With the inclusion of the EUR as an FOB currency code, the number of valid FOB currency codes accepted by
both Customs and the Australian Bureau of Statistics is now seven (7). The other currencies include the
Australian Dollar (AUD), United States of America Dollar (USD), Japanese Yen (JAP), British Pound (GBP),

Types of Information Required to Ensure Data Accuracy

To enable an agent to meet their legal obligations for accurate completion of export documentation, it is essential
that the owner of the goods provides their agent with such details as:

a full description of the goods to enable them to be classified for export (as invoices often contain insufficient
descriptions such as 'clothing' or a product code);

the level of sale [for example, Free On Board (FOB); Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF); Cost and Freight
(CFR); or EX WORKS] to enable the agent to determine the required FOB value of the goods;

the invoice currency to enable the agent to determine if conversion to Australian Dollars is required. EXIT
users currently can report FOB values in one of six major currencies when lodging an export declaration -
Australian Dollars (AUD), New Zealand Dollars (NZD), British Pounds (GBP), German Deutschmarks (DEM),
US Dollars (USD), or Japanese Yen (YEN). From 12 February 1999, EXIT users will also be able to report
FOB values in the European Union Euro (EUR). Where invoices have been completed in one of these six
major non-Australian currencies, the export declaration should be completed using the currency and FOB
details as recorded on the invoice. Conversion of the FOB value by the exporter or their agent is only required
when the invoice currency is not one of the seven major currencies;

full details regarding the quantity of goods to enable the agent to report in the correct unit of quantity that is
applicable for that commodity. Common quantity errors are the recording of square feet instead of square
metres, or kilograms instead of tonnes; and

full details relating to the final country of destination.

Export Data Accuracy

Purpose

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) has been issued to remind those involved in the export industry of the
requirement for export data to be accurate, and of the responsibility of exporters and their agents for ensuring the
correct completion of export entries.

Background

The export data provided to the Australian Customs Service (Customs) through its Export Integration (EXIT)
export clearance and reporting system is used by Customs to ensure that prohibited or restricted goods are not
exported without appropriate approval.

This information is also used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to compile international merchandise
export statistics, which are used in turn by a number of public and private sector clients to make trade decisions.

The Requirement For Export Data To Be Accurate

The accurate reporting of export data is an essential part of compliance with Customs legislation requiring that
goods are not to be exported without appropriate approval. The information supplied to Customs is used by a
number of government agencies in addition to itself to determine whether there has been any breach of
Commonwealth and/or State legislation concerning the export of goods. There are severe penalties currently in
place for such breaches. In the case of Customs, increased sanctions or administrative penalties for inaccurate
reporting are currently being developed in response to the Federal Parliament's report 'Jet Fresh: Paddock To
Plate'.

Additionally, it is vital that the information provided in an export entry is accurate as the resulting statistics provide
essential information about Australia's trade status in the international environment. They are some of the most
valuable decision-making tools available to businesses competing in the international trade arena and to
governments in relation to industry and foreign trade matters.

It therefore makes good business sense to accurately complete an export entry.

The Role Of Exporters And Agents

As export statistics have a significant impact on Australia's trade and business decisions, as well as on its
international trade control obligations, exporters and agents must provide the correct information on export
entries.

Additionally, it is an offence under ss.234(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 to knowingly or recklessly make
a statement to Customs (including through the submission of an export entry) that is false or misleading
in a material particular, or to knowingly or recklessly omit from a statement made to a Customs Officer
any matter or thing without which the statement is misleading in a material particular. The penalty for this
offence is a fine of up to $5,000. It is therefore essential that exporters provide sufficient information to
their agents for them to be able to accurately complete an export entry on their behalf.

Attached is a guide to the type of information that exporters are required to provide to Customs through their
agents.

Assistance With Customs Export Documentation

If, for example, you have difficulty in determining the correct classification of an export commodity, or otherwise
need assistance with Customs export documentation, you can contact the Customs Exports Section in your State
or Territory or the Customs Information Centre on 1300 363 263.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/1999-12.pdf,Electronic Lodgement of Refunds (ELOR),"Australian Customs Notice 1999 12

Electronic Lodgement of Refunds (ELOR)

Electronic Lodgement for import entries was introduced in 1991 as part of Customs move towards a total
electronic import clearance environment. Refund processing was not included as part of this facility.

To continue the move towards paperless procedures Customs is now in the process of automating the refund
system. Legislation is currently under review and the COMPILE system is being enhanced to allow an electronic
refund approval facility.

Providing the necessary amendments are enacted the ELOR system will:

allow full electronic lodgement of refunds through the COMPILE system;
provide instantaneous information on refund routing similar to the existing import entry processing system ie
red-line/green-line;
provide an on-line screen showing the status of refunds, ie not lodged, lodged, Query Advice issued,
approved, paid or rejected;
provide a paper-free environment unless the refund is red-lined in which case Customs will call for relevant
documentation;
provide importers with faster payment of refunds due to them; and
upon full implementation of ELOR, ease the administrative burden on customs brokers because they will not
have to produce full documentation to Customs for every refund claimed as is the current practice.

It is proposed that the COMPILE enhancements will be implemented in May 1999. These enhancements will
include the generation of Entry Message Advices and declaration questions for refunds and a refund profile
facility will be activated. Refunds will still be routed RED at lodgement until legislative amendments have been
enacted. However, internal procedures will ensure low risk refunds are approved promptly.

During the phase up until implementation Brokers and Customs Refunds officers will be able to familiarise
themselves with the changes to the system and procedures. Further documentation regarding this phase will be
distributed at the training sessions.

Prior to the implementation of ELOR, information seminars and COMPILE training sessions are to be conducted
in various regions. Information seminars will cover the policy and legislative amendments required for
implementation. The COMPILE training sessions will cover enhancements to the COMPILE system to cater for
ELOR.

The schedule for COMPILE training sessions and the policy information seminars is set out in Attachment A. The
contact officers for session/seminar bookings or further information are:

Notice of Objection to Importation Trade Marks Act 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act
1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to them, or in relation to
them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force
for a period of two years from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in
Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade
mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain
objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it
has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice
regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final
paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is
substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to be seized by
Customs, unless it can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of
trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or

- the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not,
amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions
of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially
identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.

The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish
to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each
State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of
Objection, or Customs' role in regard to those Notices, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and
Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs Service Office in their nearest capital city.

Customs Data Harmonisation - the G7 and WCO Models

Uniform Customs Documentation and Electronic Messaging

Comment is invited from Australian Industry on these G7 and World Customs Organisation
initiatives to simplify customs data requirements and reduce compliance costs for industry
across the G7 countries and European Union. These broad trade facilitation measures will
have wider application, with beneficial effects for world trade and economic growth. They
are likely to be the basis for future Australian Customs data requirements and well as
those in APEC Customs administrations.

This is the first chance for international public consultation and Australian industry
is encouraged to make a direct contribution. Time frame is short and comments are
requested as soon as possible - if possible by the end of February 1999 - and be passed to
Mr Garry Grant, Director Electronic Commerce, who will relay them to the WCO.

A copy of both documents can be obtained directly by contacting Mr Grant.

G7 Heads of State directed their Customs administrations to standardise and simplify
procedures, reduce data requirements to the minimum consistent with effective
administration of Customs responsibilities, evaluate potential for uniform documentation
and the form in which data is reported electronically to Customs. Such measures will
reduce costs to both business and government and complement efforts by the World Trade
Organisation to eliminate barriers to trade and development.

The task is to be finalised by the G7 Summit in mid-2000 and will be a maximum
set of data - the final version to have less than 100 data elements. Across G7 countries
over 800 Customs data elements are in use, requiring traders to maintain different systems
for Customs declarations in each country.

The WCO is working closely with the G7 and will map the data to the international UN
standard for international electronic data interchange - UN/EDIFACT, and possibly Web-EDI.

International industry groups - such as the International Chamber of Commerce, the
International Express Carriers Council, International Air Travel Association, the
International Association of Ports and Harbours and the Universal Postal Union - have
already been informed.

G7 work has been frozen pending industry consultation - and Australian Customs is
pleased to be able to act as a co-ordination point. To assist this, Director Data
Management, Ms Barbara Toohey, will discuss the G7 model and Australian Customs
present/future data needs at roundtables planned for State capitals in the last week of
February.

Further information can be obtained from Mr Grant on 02 6275 6186 or

Air Cargo Underbond and Transhipment Processes

The Australian Customs Service (Customs) has conducted a review of the procedures governing control of transhipment and interstate underbond movement of air cargo reported by
Cargo Terminal Operator's (CTO's) at the Master Air Waybill level. With the concurrence of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), it is proposed to introduce revised
clearance procedures for these categories of air cargo from 1 March 1999.

Customs currently transmits the status of all cargo to CTO's through the Air Cargo Automation (ACA) system upon flight arrival. CTO's have experienced delays in receiving ACA status,
which can cause cargo to miss scheduled domestic and international connecting flights. The intent of the new arrangements is to alleviate any delivery delays whilst at the same time
maintaining adequate control and accountability of the cargo.

Customs and AQIS propose to allow cargo to be transhipped prior to receiving status and underbond cargo to move on a continuing permission basis in accordance with Section 71E of
the Customs Act 1901. These processes will occur as normal through ACA, however actual movement will be allowed prior to the CTO receiving a returned ACA status. Each specific
underbond movement will be required to be acquitted through ACA at the destination CTO.

In order to participate in the new arrangements, CTO's will be required to lodge a written request with the appropriate regional Customs and AQIS cargo management areas and will be
required to satisfy the following conditions :

1. The revised process is only available for flights reported in accordance with Section 64AB of the Customs Act. i.e. complete report at the Master Air Waybill level at least 2

hours prior to flight arrival.

2. CTO's must report through ACA the landing of cargo at the discharge port. A complete report of any identified surplus cargo is to be provided through ACA.
3. Underbond requests through ACA will be required for all movements, however cargo may be released for interstate underbond movements prior to receiving a return ACA status.
4. A secure intervention process is to be established between each CTO and Customs/AQIS in the event that cargo is to be examined in the port of discharge.
5. CTO's are to provide through ACA a complete report for all cargo at the port of discharge (including ""Air-side transfers"").
6. CTO's at the destination port are to check-in all underbond cargo and acquit the movement through ACA within 24 hours of arrival at the destination port.
7. CTO's will be required to comply with procedures required for the handling of goods that are specifically categorised by AQIS as ""high risk"". These procedures will be implemented

in the form of separate Compliance Agreements between CTO's and AQIS.

NOTE : Non-compliance with any of the above conditions may see a CTO removed from this arrangement and returned to the current processes.

A suitable implementation date for the above arrangements has been agreed with both AQIS and industry as 1 March 1999. Participating CTO's should endeavour to lodge
application requests with Customs and AQIS as soon as practicable.

Machine Tools and Robots Tariff Changes Customs Tariff

Proposal No.1 (1999)

The Industry Commission presented its Report on its inquiry into ""Machine Tools and Robots"" to the Treasurer on
15 August 1996. After due consideration of the Report, the Government has decided that:

(a) the customs duty on parts for machine tools and robots
classified to subheadings 8466.10.00, 8466.20.00, 8466.30.00,
8466.93.90 and 8466.94.00 of Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff
Act 1995 (""the Tariff Act"") will be reduced to Free;

(b) items 48, 49 and 55 in Part III of Schedule 4 to the Tariff Act
are to be repealed; and

(c) the definition of ""robots"" prescribed in BL9640063 which is
written to item 30 in Part II of Schedule 4 to the Tariff Act is to be
updated.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (1999) was tabled in the House of Representatives on 30 March 1999 to
implement the decisions set out at (a) and (b) above. By-law 9940001, containing the new definition of robots
based on ISO 8373:1994 (E/F), was gazetted in the Tariff Concessions Commonwealth Gazette of 31 March 1999
giving effect to (c) above. All of these alterations took effect from 1 April 1999. As the rates of duty for
subheadings 8466.93.10 and 8466.93.90 to the Tariff Act are both Free from 1 April 1999, these subheadings
have been amalgamated into new subheading 8466.93.00.

Tariff reprint pages issued in conjunction with these tariff changes are 84/59 (R.3), Schedule 4/19 (R.5), and
Schedule 4/25 (R.4). New Schedule of Concessional Instrument Part II reprint pages are Part 2/37 (R.2), 2/39
(R.3), 2/101 (R.4) and 2/103 (R.7).

CUSTOMS ACT 1901 - PART XVB INVESTIGATION INTO THE

ALLEGED DUMPING OF CERTAIN GALVANISED STEEL PIPE

FROM THAILAND

On 27 April 1999 the Australian Customs Service initiated an investigation into an application lodged by
Tubemakers of Australia Limited on behalf of the Australian industry, for the publication of a dumping duty notice
in respect of certain galvanised steel pipe exported to Australia from Thailand.

The goods covered by the investigation are hot dip galvanised, welded, circular hollow section, steel pipe in
nominal sizes DN 15-100 (as specified in Australian standard AS 1074 and British standard BS 1387). The goods
are classified within tariff subheading 7306.30.00, statistical codes 30 to 37. The general and DCT rates of duty
are 5%. The DCS rate of duty, which applies to Thailand, is 4%.

Australian Customs Dumping Notice No. 99/010 advised of the initiation of this investigation.

Pursuant to s. 269ZHI of the Customs Act 1901, the Minister has granted an extension of 30 days for the
publication of the statement of essential facts. The statement of essential facts sets out the facts on which the
CEO proposes to base the recommendations to the Minister.

The statement of essential facts will now be placed on the public record on or before 14 September 1999.
Customs will make every effort to publish the statement at an earlier date if possible.

Interested parties are invited to make submissions to Customs in response to the statement of essential facts
within 20 days of that statement being placed on the public record.

Inquiries about this notice should be directed to Dave Clark, phone (02) 6275 6044, facsimile (02) 6275 6990 or

Notices of Objection to Importation Trade Marks Act 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule
have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the
importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to them, or in relation
to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices
of Objection remain in force for a period of two years from the commencement date shown
for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular
classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks
Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade mark
relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However,
where certain objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade
marks covering a diversity of goods, it has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect
the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly indicates where that
applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice
regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in
accordance with the final paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported
with a sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant
trade mark they are liable to be seized by Customs, unless it can be established that:

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease,
hire, etc.); or

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a
trade mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not
infringed where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with
the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be
liable to seizure under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking
advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of
the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially
identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement
of"" a trade mark.

The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist
importers who may wish to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade marks in
question.

SUMMARY

This report concerns a review of the level of the interim dumping duties applying to A4 copy paper exported to
Australia from Germany by Nordland Papier AG (Nordland) and from South Africa by Mondi Paper Company Ltd
(Mondi Paper).

The Customs Act, in section 269(Z), provides for reviews of the rate of interim dumping duty where it can be
shown that one or more of the factors that are used to calculate the duty have changed.

In its January 1999 inquiry into whether the anti-dumping measures should be continued on exports of A4 copy
paper by certain exporters (including Nordland and Mondi Paper), Customs found that one or more of the variable
factors relevant to the taking of the measures had changed.

Because of these changes Customs recommended in its report to the Minister that - if the measures were to be
continued - the level of the measures should be reviewed. The Minister for Justice and Customs accepted this

ELECTRONIC LODGEMENT OF REFUNDS (ELOR)

INFORMATION SEMINARS

ACN No. 99/12 of 12 February 1999 announced enhancements to the automated refund system to permit an
electronic refund approval facility to be known as the Electronic Lodgement of Refunds (ELOR).

In that ACN it was announced that COMPILE enhancements would be implemented in May 1999 and that prior to
implementation of ELOR, information seminars covering the complimentary legislative changes to the Customs
Act and Regulations and detailing the enhancements were to be conducted in various regions.

Due to technical reasons there has been a delay in implementing the enhancements and the introduction of
ELOR. COMPILE changes have now been scheduled for implementation on 20 June 1999. This delay and the
postponement of the seminars was relayed to users by a COMPILE broadcast message on 17 March 1999.

Details of the re-scheduled seminars have now been finalised in conjunction with the Customs Brokers Council of
Australia ('CBCA').

You are invited to attend the seminars, which will be held in your region on the dates and times set out in

1999-2000

The Australian Customs Service will shortly be advising importers of their allocations of cheese and curd tariff
quota for the period 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.

Quota allocations have been based on the actual usage of the quota in the 23 months ending 31 May 1999, as
shown in Customs records of clearances for home consumption. The 23 month period has been chosen to reflect
the most recent usage of quota.

The calculation of an importer's quota entitlement excludes any quota transferred to another importer during the
23 month period or unused as at 31 May 1999.

Quota allocations are transferable between importers. Applications to transfer quota entitlements may be made
by completing a Transfer of Base Quota Allocation form. Copies of this form are available from Customs
Information Centres. Completed applications should be sent to:

National Manager Tariff Australian Customs Service Customs
House 5 Constitution Avenue CANBERRA CITY ACT 2601

Applicants are reminded that transfer applications are dealt with strictly in order of receipt and may take up to four
working days to process. This processing time is suspended when it is necessary to return an incomplete or
incorrect form and resumes when the application is returned. Applications should be submitted well in advance of
intended use.

Further information on the allocation of quota may be obtained from Renata Menkarska on (02) 6275 5802.

From 1 July 1999 there will be about 660 fewer statistical codes in the AHECC. This reduction is the outcome of a recent review which examined the usefulness of existing statistical
codes in terms of the costs to industry and Government of providing and processing the detailed information. The review was conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in
consultation with users of statistics.

The review identified and removed statistical codes with little or no reported trade, with no apparent users, or with known reporting problems. As a result, from 1 July 1999 over 1,160
AHECCs will be replaced by 501 new codes. To illustrate, under Heading Number 6109 there are currently 2 statistical codes as shown below:

6109 T-SHIRTS, SINGLETS AND OTHER VESTS, KNITTED OR CROCHETED:

6109.10

6109.10.10

6109.10.50

NO

NO

NO

- Of cotton:

- - Men's or boys'

- - Women's or girls'

As a result of the review, the new structure for Heading Number 6109 is:

6109 T-SHIRTS, SINGLETS AND OTHER VESTS, KNITTED OR CROCHETED:

6109.10.00

NO

- Of cotton

The new AHECC pages are currently being finalised and will be available before the end of June 1999.

The attached document, which lists the current AHECCs to be replaced on 1 July 1999, should be checked to determine if the goods you export, or for which you prepare Customs
documentation, are affected by the changes. If so, you should check the new AHECC pages to determine the correct new AHECC to be quoted on your export entries. If you have any
questions about the review, please contact Michelle Williams at the ABS by telephone on (02) 6252 5411, or email: michelle.williams@abs.gov.au. Questions about how to classify goods
should be referred to us.

CHANGES TO THE STATISTICAL CODES IN THE CUSTOMS TARIFF

From 1 July 1999 there will be about 1,500 fewer statistical codes in the Customs Tariff. This reduction is the outcome of a recent review which examined the usefulness of existing
statistical codes in terms of the costs to industry and Government of providing and processing the detailed information. The review was conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
in consultation with users of the statistics.

The review identified and removed statistical codes with little or no reported trade, with no apparent users, or with known reporting problems. As a result, from 1 July 1999 over 2,500
Harmonized Tariff Item Statistical Codes (HTISCs) will be replaced by 1,000 new codes.

The revision is illustrated by the following example. Under tariff subheading 8450.11.00 information for washing machines is currently divided into four statistical codes as shown below:

It is anticipated that the tariff reprint pages containing the new statistical codes will be despatched to users in the week commencing 14 June 1999. The attachment to this ACN lists the
HTISCs which will be replaced from 1 July 1999. Users should check the attachment to determine if the goods they import, or for which they prepare Customs documentation, are
affected by the changes. If so, users should refer to the new tariff reprint pages to determine the new HTISC. The replaced HTISCs will not be valid for entry processing after 30 June
1999.

If you have any queries about the review, please contact Michelle Williams at the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 02 6252 5411, or e-mail michelle.williams@abs.gov.au. Questions on

REDUCTION OF SALES TAX RATE FOR SOME GOODS

TAXED AT 32%

Under the new tax system, from 1 July 2000 sales tax will be replaced by the goods and services tax (GST).
Goods that have been taxed at 32% under sales tax legislation will be taxed at 10% under GST legislation.

As this difference between the rate of sales tax and GST may lead retailers and customers to delay purchases,
the sales tax rate will be reduced to 22% from 29 July 1999 for all goods previously taxed at 32%, except certain
fur skin goods, jewellery and precious stones.

The Australian Taxation Office has released Sales Tax Bulletin Number 39 - Message about the New Tax
System which deals with this reduction in sales tax in more detail.

Which goods are affected?

Goods presently covered by Items 4 to 14 in Schedule 5 to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act
1992 will have their rate of tax reduced to 22% from 29 July 1999.

The goods covered include certain:

studs, sleeve links and tie pins;
precious metal goods and plated ware;
watches, clocks and watch bands;
binoculars and opera glasses;
cameras, including video cameras;
photographic enlargers;
film and slide projectors, viewers and screens;
tape recorders, video recorders, radios, televisions and stereo players;
picture tubes for television receivers;
slot machines for gambling and amusement operated by coins or tokens; and
parts for many of these goods.

Reference should be made to the exact wording in the Items.

When will the rate be reduced?

The 32% rate on affected goods will be reduced to 22% on 29 July 1999.

Effect of the reduction in rate.

No systems changes to COMPILE are needed. The rate reduction simply requires you to enter 22% rather than
32% for the sales tax rate on affected goods for goods entered on or after 29 July 1999.

Advance entries.

Special care will need to be taken with advance entries before 29 July 1999. In this regard, reference should be
made to subsection 71A(7) of the Customs Act 1901. An effect of this provision is that advance entry goods could
be subject to a 22% sales tax rate rather than a 32% sales tax rate even though the import entry is communicated
to Customs before 29 July 1999.

Withdrawn entries.

Special care will also need to be taken when entries are withdrawn and a later entry made in respect of particular
goods. In particular, reference should be made to section 23 of the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992. An effect of
this provision is that withdrawn entry goods could be subject to a 32% sales tax rate even though an entry is
made after 29 July 1999.

INDEXATION OF CERTAIN EXCISE AND CUSTOMS TARIFF DUTY RATES AND THE DIESEL FUEL
REBATE

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer (except ""home brew""),
tobacco and certain petroleum products will change on and from 2 August 1999. Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment provide the new rates. For this indexation, the provisions require the
June 1999 index number published by the Australian Statistician to be divided by the previous highest December or June index number to determine the factor used to index the rates of
duty. Accordingly, the June 1999 number (122.3) has been divided by the December 1998 number (121.9) to establish the indexation factor of 1.003. In accordance with long-standing
policy, where rates of excise and customs duty are indexed in the above circumstances, complementary increases in the rates of diesel fuel rebate are also made. These increases are
effected by declarations under subsection 78A(5A) of the Excise Act 1901 and subsection 164(5A) of the Customs Act 1901. It is proposed that new declared rates of diesel fuel rebate
will be notified in the Commonwealth Gazette GN 31 of 4 August 1999. Upon gazettal, the proposed new declared rates will also be effective on and from 2 August 1999 and are listed in
Tables 3 and 4 of the Attachment. Actual rates of rebate payable can differ from these declared rates because of the averaging provisions of the rebate legislation. The rate applicable to
a particular claim is shown on the payment advice forwarded to claimants. Any enquiries concerning these matters should be directed to:

AMENDMENTS TO THE CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED

IMPORTS/EXPORTS) REGULATIONS

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and Customs (Prohibited
Exports) Regulations 1958 were notified in Special Gazette No. S376 of 16 August 1999. The amendments
commenced on gazettal.

SANCTIONS AGAINST ANGOLA

The United Nations Security Council imposed, via Resolution 1173 of 12 June 1998 further sanctions against the
forces of Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (""UNITA""). The sanctions prohibit the import of all
diamonds from Angola not controlled through the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation of Angola's,
Certificate of Origin system. In addition, the sanctions also prohibit the sale or supply of equipment to Angola
used in mining or mining services and motorized vehicles or watercraft or spare parts for such vehicles, or ground
or waterborne transportation services.

Diamonds from Angola:

The importation of diamonds from Angola is prohibited unless covered by a permission from the Minister for
Foreign Affairs or an authorised person of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The prohibition is
implemented in Australia by regulation 4M of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 as amended by
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 165 and applies only to goods classified under heading 7102 of Schedule 3 to
the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Jewellery that contains diamonds is not affected by the prohibition.

Export of certain goods to Angola:

The prohibitions on the sale or supply of equipment to Angola (other than for verified medical and humanitarian
purposes) used in mining or mining services and motorised vehicles or watercraft or spare parts for such
vehicles, or ground or waterborne transportation services are implemented in Australia by regulation 13CF of
the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 as amended by Statutory Rules 1999 No. 164.

Regulation 13CH prohibits the exportation of the following goods to persons or entities in areas of Angola to
which State administration has not been extended unless a permission in writing to export the goods, given by the
Minister for Foreign Affairs or an authorised person of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is presented
to Customs at or before the time of exportation.

The newly imposed sanctions are in addition to those currently applied to the exportation to Angola, of petroleum,
petroleum products, aircraft and aircraft components and imposed via United Nations Security Council Resolution
Nos. 864, 1127 and 1135 of 1997. ACN Nos. 94/37 of 10 June 1994 and 98/04 of 13 January 1998 refer.

Any inquires concerning these amendments should be directed to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade,
Canberra on (02) 6261 1842.

SANCTIONS AGAINST SIERRA LEONE

The United Nations Security Council, via Resolution 1171 of 5 June 1998, imposed sanctions against Sierra
Leone preventing the sale, other than through specific entry points nominated by the government of Sierra Leone,
of arms and related material of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment,
paramilitary equipment and spare parts.

Paramilitary equipment and spare parts:

The prohibition is implemented in Australia by regulation 13CH of the Customs (Prohibited Exports)
Regulations1958 as amended by Statutory Rules 1999 No. 164. These relax the previous total prohibition on
such equipment imposed via United Nations Security Council Resolution 1132 (1997) of 8 October 1997.
Exportation of paramilitary equipment and spare parts to Sierra Leone is prohibited unless a permission in writing
to export the goods, given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs or an authorised person of the Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade, is presented to Customs at or before the time of exportation.

TARIFF CHANGES TO ALUMINIUM CANSHEET AND STEEL

TINPLATE

On 6 July 1999 the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator the Honourable Nick Minchin
announced that the Government would remove the customs duty on aluminium cansheet and steel tinplate from 1
October 1999.

A Customs Tariff Proposal giving effect to this decision is expected to be tabled in the House of Representatives
in the week commencing 20 September 1999. The Proposal is that:

the rates of duty for tariff subheadings 7210.11.00, 7210.12.00 and 7212.10.00 which cover tinplate reduce to
free; and

a new Schedule 4 item be created to accord aluminium cansheet classified in subheadings 7606.12.00 or
7606.92.00, and used in the manufacture of aluminium cans, duty free entry.

It is also intended that, after the Proposal is introduced into the Parliament, a by-law will be made detailing the
aluminium cansheet eligible for concessional entry, as set out at Attachment A.

Tariff reprint pages to be issued in conjunction with this change are:

Schedule 3 - 72/11 (R.2), 72.13 (R.2) and Schedule 4/31 (R.3).

GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE -

REIMBURSEMENTS - REVIEW OF PROCEDURE

A Government administrative charge was introduced on 11 September 1990 (ACN 90/124 refers), which is the
equivalent of Customs duty and is levied on Commonwealth departmental / bodies and authorities, which are not
otherwise liable to Customs duty. This ensures that the Commonwealth and commercial importers are subject to
the same conditions in importing.

In ACN No. 98/53, Customs announced new procedures for the reimbursement of an overpaid Government
administrative charge.

The purpose of this new policy was to ensure that applications for reimbursement of an administrative charge
were treated in the same manner as applications for a refund of Customs duty lodged by the private sector for
normal commercial importations.

Applicants for reimbursement of administrative charges were reminded that they would need to lodge an
application, within 12 months of the date of payment of the charges, to ensure that the procedures are in line with
applications made under S.163 of the Customs Act1901 and Customs Regulation 128A.

The announcement of the restriction of 12 months for the reimbursement of administrative charges inadvertently
prejudiced the conditions applying to the treatment of Government Departments/Authorities in instances where
the regulations provide for some other period of time. This was not the intent of the policy.

Applications lodged for reimbursement of administrative charges will now be treated in the same manner as those
lodged for refund of Customs duty. The period of time, within which the application may be made, will be
determined from the regulations in the same manner as if the application had been for a refund of Customs duty.

As previously advised, applicants will need to apply for reimbursement of overpaid administrative charges, to the
Refunds Section in the region in which goods were imported. The applications may NOT be made through the
COMPILE system, since the administrative charge is not a Customs duty. Applications will need to be made in
writing and will be considered and paid through the regional Customs office.

Please direct any enquires in respect of this notice to Mr Ron Houston, Senior Inspector, Refunds on (02) 6275
6504.

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS

ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act
1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to them, or in relation to
them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force
for a period of two years from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark. The references in the
Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks
Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade mark relates to the specific goods
listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain objectors have lodged a Notice of
Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it has not been feasible to
comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly indicates where that
applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice regarding the coverage of
the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final paragraph below). Where
goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is substantially
identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to be seized by Customs, unless it
can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of
trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or - the goods do not infringe the
relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not,
amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark. People who have
been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the Trade
Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the
implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"",
""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark. The trade mark owner's contact particulars have
been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade
marks in question. Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the
capital city of each State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the
Notices of Objection, or Customs' role in regard to those Notices, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and
Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs Service Office in their nearest capital city. (P G BURNS) National

RENEWAL OF CUSTOMS AGENT AND CORPORATE CUSTOMS AGENTS LICENCES

All Customs Agents Licences and Corporate Customs Agents Licences on issue expire on 31 December 1999. Subsection 183CJ(1) of the Customs Act 1901, (the Act), provides for the
renewal of licences. As in previous years ""Application for Renewal of Customs Agents Licence"" will be distributed to all Customs Agents and Corporate Customs Agents currently
licensed with Customs. Current licence holders wishing to renew their licences should make written application by completing their ""Application for Renewal of Customs Agents Licence""
form and forwarding to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or a Regional Director on or before c.o.b. 31 December 1999. Payment of the renewal fee should accompany the renewal
application. It should be noted that failure to renew a licence by c.o.b. 31 December 1999 will render the licence invalid. This will mean that individuals or corporate bodies who have not
renewed their licences by that date, but who still wish to be licensed, will be required to make a new application to the CEO. Following receipt of the new application the CEO, pursuant
to section 183CB of the Act, will forward the application to the National Customs Agents Licensing Advisory Committee (NCALAC) which will be required to report to the CEO as to
whether the applicant should be licensed. Fees in respect of the renewal of a customs agents licence are to be paid not later than the day on which the renewal of the licence is to
come into force (Customs Regulation No.160). The fee payable (Customs Regulation 158) in respect of the grant or renewal of a customs agents licence is:

1. where the customs agent is a natural person who does not intend to act, at any time when the licence is in force in his/her own right - $20; or
2. in any other case $200.

In order to facilitate the processing of the ""Application for Renewal of Customs Agents Licence"" forms by Customs, licence holders intending to renew their licences, are requested to
complete their renewal form and lodge it, together with the respective fee well before 31 December 1999. Corporate Customs Agents are also requested to include with their application
form:

1. a list of all nominees currently employed with their agency; and
2. a list of all persons currently having authority to direct the nominees of the agency for the purposes of the Act.

In relation to this request Corporate customs agents are reminded that, in accordance with ss183CG(3) of the Act, it is a condition of their licence that the CEO be advised within thirty
(30) days of a change of nominees, persons authorised to direct nominees or composition of a partnership. Distribution of Renewal Notices

The ""Application for Renewal of Licence"" will be forwarded directly to the last known address of the licensee. The licensee will then be responsible for presenting the completed renewal
application and the payment of the licence fee to the CEO or a Regional Director. Payment of Licence Fee

The licence fees can be paid by either:

1. mailing the completed renewal form and a cheque payable to the ""Australian Customs Service"" to

Secretary National Customs Agent Licensing Advisory Committee Australian Customs Service 5 Constitution Avenue CANBERRA ACT 2601

3. presenting the completed renewal form and payment to the cashier at your local Customs House.

If the payment is made via mail the licence will be forwarded to the licensee as soon as possible after the processing of the payment through the ""Revenue Collection System"". If
payment is made via the cashier at the local Customs House the cashier will input the Customs brokers licence number into the ""Revenue Collection System"", which in turn will record
the transaction and issue two copies of a receipt. The original of the receipt will be given to the licensee and the licence will be forwarded via mail as soon as possible after processing of
the payment. The ""Application for Renewal of Licence"" will be held by the Secretary of the National Customs Agents Licensing for his/her records. NOTE: As mentioned in ACN 98/02
the ACS is in the process of implementing the recommendations that arose from a joint ACS and Industry review of Customs Broker licensing. The recommendation that
Customs brokers licences be renewed by c.o.b. 30 June every three years in lieu of the current practice of renewing once yearly by c.o.b. 31 December is currently before
the Parliament and may be operative for when licences become renewable in December 2000. The initial issue of licences operative from 1 January 2001 is expected to be
for two and a half years to allow the ensueing licences to be operative from July 1.

DEFERRAL OF GST ON IMPORTED GOODS

Section 33-15 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (the GST Act) provides that amounts
of GST on taxable importations are to be paid by the importer to the Commonwealth:

1. at the same time, at the same place, and in the same manner, as customs duty is payable on the goods in

question (or would be payable if the goods were subject to customs duty); or

2. in the circumstances specified in the regulations, within such further time specified in the regulations, and at

the place and in the manner specified in the regulations.

The regulations will allow for deferral of payments of GST on taxable importations to coincide with payments of
net amounts of GST. Details of a proposed GST deferral scheme developed jointly by the Australian Customs
Service (Customs) and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) are attached. The deferral scheme is intended to
commence on 1 July 2000 at the same time that GST is introduced. The ATO will invite importers to apply to
participate in the scheme early in 2000. In the meantime interested parties are invited to comment on the
proposal. Persons wishing to contribute their views are asked to submit them in writing to the addressees below
by close of business Friday 5 November 1999.

Principal design features of the deferral system for GST on imported goods Attachment A to 99/66

Scope of the
scheme

Deferral of GST on imports will be limited to those importations that are entered for home consumption at the time of importation (Nature 10 entries). Goods
imported under a number of existing and proposed arrangements that already effectively provide for deferral of duty and GST will be excluded from the proposal (eg
Customs warehousing arrangements, and goods imported under the TEXCO scheme and the proposed TRADEX scheme that are diverted into home
consumption). Low value imports cleared on informal clearance documents will also be excluded.

Admission to
the scheme

Importers must be registered for GST and must apply to the ATO for approval to participate in the deferral scheme.
Unregistered importers will be required to pay GST and duty at the time the goods are entered for home consumption or otherwise dealt with under the Customs Act
1901.

Importers must
lodge Business
Activity
Statements
monthly

Importers must
deal with the
ATO and
Customs
electronically

Importers must
have a good
compliance
record

Disqualification
from the
scheme

Importers may apply to participate in the deferral scheme if:

they are required to lodge GST returns monthly because their annual turnover is $20 million or more (section 27-15 of the GST
Act); or

their annual turnover is less than $20 million and they choose to lodge returns monthly (section 27-10 of the GST Act).

Importers may apply to participate in the deferral scheme if:

they are required to lodge GST returns electronically because their annual turnover is $20 million or more (section 31-25(2) of
the GST Act); or

their annual turnover is less than $20 million and they choose to lodge returns electronically (section 31-25(1) of the GST Act).

As a general principle, importers wishing to participate in the deferral scheme must not have any debt outstanding to the ATO.

Importers may be debarred from the deferral scheme if they-

fail to lodge their Business Activity Statements by the due date;

fail to pay their ATO obligations by the due date; or

are subject to administrative penalties under any Act administered by the Commissioner.

CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSAL NO. 6 (1999) AND EXCISE TARIFF PROPOSAL NO. 2 (1999)
INTRODUCTION OF A PER-STICK RATE OF DUTY ON TOBACCO PRODUCTS

From 1 November 1999 duty on most locally manufactured and imported cigarettes, light weight cigars and any other light weight tobacco products marketed in stick form, will be levied
at a per-stick rate. Specifically, any cigarette, cigar, bidi or other stick based tobacco product with an actual tobacco content of not more than 0.8 grams per stick, will be subject to a duty
rate of $0.18872 per stick. All other cigarettes, cigars, bidis and stick based products and other tobacco products will be subject to a rate of $235.90 per kilogram of tobacco content. The
rate of duty for snuff remains at $1.92 per kilogram. In line with other measures to address illicit production, imported tobacco currently falling to sub-headings 2401.20.00, 2401.30.00
and 2403.91.00 will also be subject to the per kilogram tobacco content rate. A new item, 67 in Part III of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff, will be created to enable licensed tobacco
manufacturers duty free access to this tobacco when it is used to manufacture excisable tobacco products. The existing Additional Note to Chapter 24 has been repealed. It will be
replaced by a new Additional Note which directs that bidis be classified in subheading 2402.20. Customs tariff reprint pages to be issued in conjunction with these changes are: Tariff Act
15 (R.3), Schedule 3 24/1 (R.1), 24/3 (R.9) and 24/5 (R.5) and Schedule 4/31 (R.2). A concordance of customs tariff subheadings for these changes is attached. Excise tariff reprint page

TEMPORARY IMPORTS - FACT SHEET ATTACHMENT C to 99/69

This paper provides guidance for personal and commercial importers wishing to use the provisions for temporary duty free admission of goods intended to be re-exported.

The contents should be read in conjunction with Australian Customs Notice 99/69 of 18 November 1999 which explains the new Section 162AA provisions and notifies importers and
exporters of new requirements to lodge a formal application for Section 162A goods arriving without carnet.

Applications for temporary duty free admission can be lodged under the following provisions:

1. SECTION 162A/REGULATION 125A (OLYMPIC PROVISIONS)

This provision caters for goods imported in connection with the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games and associated events (""Olympics""). All goods admitted under Regulation
125A must be re-exported by 31 December 2000, or such further period as the Customs may allow on application.

Importers must now apply for permission to take delivery of such goods on ""Application for Permission to Take Delivery of Goods Upon Giving a Security or Undertaking for the Payment
of Duty"" - Form 46A (applicable to Olympic goods only).

Electronic/documentary lodgement

Determine the goods are eligible for temporary duty free admission.

Complete and lodge Form 46A with supporting documentation such as invoices, packing lists, waybills, etc. with the Securities/Auxiliaries area in the port of import.

Securities will allocate a continuing or single permission security concession number (SCN), which can be quoted up to the registered value on all applications submitted through
COMPILE.

Both the SCN and the new treatment code specific to Olympic goods (353) must be quoted on the COMPILE application. Treatment code 353 will exempt applications from Customs
COMPILE processing charges. All remaining goods temporarily admitted under Section 162A (including goods arriving without a carnet) will not attract the processing charges.
(Note: COMPILE will produce an error message if the user inputs the incorrect treatment code or mixes permanent imports with temporary imports on the one lodgement).

Quote the common Customs owner code (2873281A) and supplier code (2873284Q) allocated to identify all temporarily imported Olympic goods.

The Schedule 3 tariff item must also be quoted when using the new treatment code.

Goods temporarily imported using COMPILE will be subject to standard response times, as specified in service level agreements. The standard value threshold (A$250) also applies
to such goods.

Data capture

The existing COMPILE screens will be used to input import data. Existing mandatory fields will be retained and the following fields used to minimise complexity and maintain control.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Attachment D to 99/69 TEMPORARY ADMISSION OF GOODS IN
CONNECTION WITH THE SYDNEY 2000 OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES AND ASSOCIATED
EVENTS

1. Can sub-contractors or brokers utilise the temporary importation provisions of Regulation 125A and Section 162A? Yes. Provided they supply the appropriate evidence that
the goods are ""to be used in or for purposes related to the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games and associated events"" and are intended to be re-exported. 2. Who can sign
""Application for Permission to Take Delivery of Goods Upon Giving a Security or Undertaking for the Payment of Duty"" (Forms 46A and 46AA) for temporary imports under
Section 162A? The importer or duly authorised broker may lodge Forms 46A and 46AA. If the goods are not re-exported and revenue is payable, recovery will be initiated against the
person or organisation who lodged the original undertaking. 3. Will a Broker be liable for duty etc. if they sign an undertaking or lodge a security and a client defaults on any
subsequent payment? Whoever lodged the security or undertaking (ie, importer, owner or authorised agent) is liable. Customs is entitled to recover from the ""security giver"" who can
then in turn recover from the client. If a broker is unwilling to accept the commercial risk of lodging a security or undertaking on behalf of a client, the client can be requested to lodge the
document. Customs has the right to require securities with surety if considered necessary. The Broker or security giver is responsible for providing evidence of re-export of goods. 4. Do
goods imported under Section 162A require formal entry for home consumption? No. Goods admitted under Section 162A (including carnet goods) are deemed to have been
entered, however there is now a requirement for information to be provided in an approved format if goods arrive without a carnet. This information can be submitted electronically
through COMPILE or using a manual application. The specific treatment code (353) and owner/supplier codes must be quoted on COMPILE applications to identify the goods as
connected with the Olympics. 5. If revenue has to be paid at a later date (i.e. if the goods are not re-exported), how is the money tendered? Payment is tendered by debit note or
invoice. During the early part of 2000, Customs will evaluate whether programming changes are necessary to permit payment via electronic debit note/post warrant adjustment. 6. Does
current prohibited imports and prohibited exports legislation apply to goods imported for the Olympics? Yes. There is no relaxation of import and export prohibitions and
restrictions. Relevant permits, for both imports and exports, must be obtained. 7. Do current Quarantine laws and requirements apply to goods imported for the Olympics? Yes.
Quarantine laws have not been relaxed, and apply to both imports and exports. 8. When should goods imported temporarily for the Olympics be re-exported? The specified date
for re-export is 31 December 2000. Limited extensions may be granted if extenuating circumstances exist. 9. What rate of duty and sales tax will be applied if temporary imports are
not re-exported? The rates of duty, sales tax and any other revenue such as the Goods and ServicesTax (GST) will be those in force at the time of initial import of the goods or when
the goods are released from Customs control, as if temporary import permission had not been granted. 10. Will temporary imports be subject to GST? Temporary imports are taxable
importations, however before 1 July 2000 GST will not be payable. After 1 July 2000 the security or undertaking will include duty, GST and the Luxury Car Tax (LCT) if applicable. 11.
Can goods admitted temporarily, which are not subsequently re-exported, be depreciated in value during use in Australia to reduce the duty/sales tax (or GST)
liability? Depreciation is not available for temporary imports unless the goods are completely destroyed or rendered valueless, in which case partial or full remission may be considered.
The Customs value of the goods at the time of import is the relevant figure for calculating all charges. 12. Rather than be re-exported, can temporary imports be donated to
charities, schools, universities, and sporting clubs etc., without payment of duty/sales tax? No. Duty and sales tax (or GST) must be paid before temporary importations are
donated to any organisation. 13. How can the new Section 162AA applications be lodged by computer? The broker will select a specific owner/supplier and treatment code in
COMPILE after registering the security/undertaking (as per the existing Section 162 procedures). The broker will retain the initial application (Form 46A, etc.). 14. If an electronic
application is lodged, how should supporting documentation be lodged? The same documentary requirements will apply as for Section 162 goods, with the additional requirement
to prove a connection with the Olympics unless the goods are eligible for carnet but arrive without one. Faxed documents will be acceptable and a proportion of original paperwork will be
audited to ensure appropriate use of Olympic provisions. Brokers should retain supporting documentation for post entry audit. 15. What goods need to be reported for export? Goods
temporarily imported under Section 162 or Section 162A that are included in a consignment over the value of $500 and classified to a single export statistical item under the Australian
Harmonised Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) code, require an export entry (Section 162), or an application to export (Section 162A). Goods which arrived on carnet do not
require separate export documentation. 16. What format should be used to report the re-export of temporarily imported goods? The current electronic (EXIT) export entry or the
manual entry for exportation should be used and the lodgement process remains unchanged. Copies of supporting documentation evidencing the re-export of goods should be retained,
eg export bills of lading, airway bills, packing lists, etc. 17. What Australian Harmonised Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) code should be used to classify re-exported
""Olympic"" goods temporarily imported under Section 162A/Regulation 125A? Goods admitted under Section 162A by quoting new Supplementary Item 111A and treatment code
353 will require an application to re-export the goods. Before the creation of the new Olympic AHECC code on 1 February 2000, codes 9902.20.11 or 9902.20.21 should be used. After 1
February 2000, AHECC code 9902.20.05 applies. 18. What Australian Harmonised Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) code should be used to classify re-exported

TEMPORARY IMPORT PROVISIONS

Additional legislative provisions were recently introduced to cover the duty free admission of goods temporarily
imported under Section 162A of the Customs Act 1901.

The new provisions affect both goods for use in, or for purposes related to, the Sydney 2000 Olympic and
Paralympic Games (""Olympics"") and associated events, and goods eligible for admission under international
Customs Conventions which arrive without a carnet.

The legislative amendments implemented the following changes:

i) specifying 31 December 2000 as the last date for re-export of
goods temporarily imported for the Olympics and associated
events; and

ii) a requirement for importers and exporters to lodge a formal
application for temporary admission under Section 162AA for
goods arriving without a carnet, and provide certain information
to Customs.

For Olympic and other eligible temporary imports, the existing Section 162 provisions may also be utilised.
Temporary admission will also be granted to Section 162A goods arriving on carnets issued under international
Customs Conventions signed by Australia (eg. fairs, exhibitions and events, professional equipment).

Importers may apply for temporary duty free admission by lodging ""Application for Permission to Take Delivery of
Goods upon Giving a Security or Undertaking for the Payment of Duty"" Form 46A (Olympic related goods) or
Form 46AA (for goods eligible for admission under international Customs Conventions that arrive without a
carnet), direct with Customs.

The newly designed ""Application for Permission to Take Delivery of Goods upon Giving a Security or Undertaking
for the Payment of Duty"" forms are similar to the existing Form 46 used for Section 162 goods. Sample copies of
the new forms are at attachment 'A' and attachment 'B' of the ACN.

Section 162A temporary importations arriving without a carnet can be electronically lodged through COMPILE.
Importers wishing to use a Customs broker can obtain permission to take delivery through COMPILE. In such
cases they should lodge Form 46A or 46AA with the broker, who will retain the application(s).

The security or undertaking form will be registered at the port of import. For continuing securities or undertakings
the registered number can then be quoted up to the established amount of revenue.

A new item (Item 111A) and relevant treatment codes (to distinguish Olympic and other Section 162A goods)
have been created in the Supplementary Provisions of the Customs Tariff. Treatment code 353 covers goods to
be used in, or for purposes related to the Olympics, and treatment code 354 applies to other Section 162A goods
arriving without carnet.

Goods temporarily admitted under Section 162A (including goods arriving without a carnet) will not attract
Customs COMPILE processing charges, however Tradegate network and quarantine fees will be payable. The
operative date for electronic submission through COMPILE will be 24 November 1999.

An application to export goods delivered under Section 162A can be made electronically through EXIT or by
manual lodgement of the application with Customs. These options are available for both Olympic and other
Section 162A goods.

IMPORT CARGO COMPUTER SYSTEMS - CONTINGENCY ARRANGEMENTS

Introduction

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) replaces ACN No 95/62. It advises the Australian importing industry of contingency arrangements that will apply to the release of commercial
import cargo if and when Australian Customs Service (Customs) import related computer systems suffer extended outage.

The ACN applies to any extended outage affecting COMPILE and/or Sea Cargo Automation (SCA) and/or Air Cargo Automation (ACA) including potential Year 2000 related outages.

Customs will invoke and communicate the contingency arrangements as the outage situation dictates. It is always Customs aim to deliver industry the best possible service under these
conditions but Customs must still ensure that community protection and legislative compliance obligations continue to be met. Industry should therefore be aware that, under contingency
arrangements, import clearance service levels may not meet the levels achieved under regular automated systems.

Please Note: In the case of an outage of EDIFICE and/or Interim EDIFICE, users can revert to either COMPILE or the Manual Entry system. If COMPILE is also unavailable,
EDIFICE/Interim EDIFICE users may choose to utilise the contingency arrangements covered in this ACN.

The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is an equal partner with Customs in the import cargo clearance process. AQIS also have contingency requirements that must be
met in the event of an extended outage.

Generally speaking, an extended outage is deemed to be a COMPILE, SCA or ACA outage exceeding or likely to exceed three hours duration during scheduled availability times.

Customs State Notices will complement this ACN in all regions. The State Notice will detail specific Customs regional requirements and points of contact for the day to day administration
and operation under contingency conditions. State Notices are published by each region and can be obtained from your local Customs House.

To some extent, potential Year 2000 problems may include increased community and industry communication difficulties. For this reason the following four points are specific to potential
Year 2000 outages only. They do not apply to outages at other times.

1. If Customs import systems are unavailable from 'start of business' on 1 January 2000, contingency arrangements will be invoked by Customs as soon as is practical, but no later than

midday 1 January 2000 ESDST. (Eastern Standard Daylight Savings Time)

2. If Customs import systems are not available, and official advice in relation to system availability cannot be reasonably transmitted to industry by midday on 1 January 2000, industry
should presume import contingency arrangements are in place. This can be confirmed by reference to 'contingency advice' posted on the front door of affected Customs premises.

3. The current 'hours of business' for lodging contingency documentation with Customs are covered under Customs Regulation 19. In the normal course of events, the contingency

business hours exclude national public holidays. For the period immediately following the Year 2000 changeover however, if contingency arrangements are required, Customs facilities
will be available on the public holidays.

4. Year 2000 contingency arrangements will continue until such time as import system availability has been restored and contingency arrangements are officially declared to no longer

apply. The cessation of contingency arrangements will be communicated to the importing industry by the regular means.

Note:To the extent it is reasonable and possible, industry are advised to consider pre-clearance of imported cargo
scheduled to arrive during the Year 2000 changeover period.

For ease of reference, this ACN is divided into 6 sections. Each section identifying the relevant Customs or AQIS contingency requirements for meeting Commercial and Border release
conditions during an outage.

Section 1 Customs COMPILE contingency
Section 2 Customs Sea Cargo Automation (SCA) contingency
Section 3 Customs Air Cargo Automation (ACA) contingency
Section 4 AQIS Entry contingency
Section 5 AQIS Sea Cargo Automation (SCA) contingency
Section 6 AQIS Air Cargo Automation (ACA) contingency

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS

ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act
1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to them, or in relation to
them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force
for a period of two years from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark. The references in the
Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks
Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade mark relates to the specific goods
listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain objectors have lodged a Notice of
Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it has not been feasible to
comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly indicates where that
applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice regarding the coverage of
the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final paragraph below). Where
goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is substantially
identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to be seized by Customs, unless it
can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of
trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or

- the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not,
amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark. People who have
been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the Trade
Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the
implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"",
""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark. The trade mark owner's contact particulars have
been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade
marks in question. Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the
capital city of each State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the
Notices of Objection, or Customs' role in regard to those Notices, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and
Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs Service Office in their nearest capital city. (P G BURNS) National

CUSTOMS TARIFF NOTICE NO. 2 (1999) CUSTOMS TARIFF

PROPOSAL NO. 8 (1999) SUBSTITUTION OF PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS

On 18 October 1999, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator the Honourable Rod Kemp, announced changes to the
petroleum provisions in the Excise Tariff Act 1921, to combat fuel substitution activities. Fuel substitution occurs
when petrol or diesel fuel used as transport fuel is replaced with product that is subject to a lower rate of excise.

The changes will not create an additional duty liability and will operate on and from 15 November 1999.

Customs Tariff Notice No. 2 (1999) giving effect to this decision was published in a Special
Commonwealth Gazette on 11 November 1999. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 8 (1999) containing these alterations
is expected to be tabled in the House of Representatives in the week commencing 6 December 1999.

Customs tariff reprint pages to be issued in conjunction with these changes are: Tariff Act 15 (R.4), Schedule 3
27/3 (R.8), 27/5 (R.10), 27/7 (R.6) and 27/9 (R.8). A concordance of customs tariff subheadings for these
changes is attached. Excise tariff pages E79 (R.7), E81 (R.7), E83 (R.10), E85 (R.10) and E87 (R.7) will be
issued by the Australian Taxation Office.

Contact officers for these changes are:

Excise: John Charleston, Australian Taxation Office, Melbourne, (03) 9285 1243; and

Customs: Ray Banvill, Australian Customs Service, Canberra, (02) 6275 6516.

CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS NOs. 3 AND 4 (1999)

On 21 July 1999, Customs Tariff Notice No. 1 was published in Commonwealth Gazette GN29 notifying the
creation of Additional Note 1 in Chapter 57 of Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. For the purposes of
Chapter 57, the new note defines ""floor coverings"" as including all mats, rugs, and similar goods.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1999) was introduced into the House of Representatives on 25 August 1999
validating this change which came into operation on 22 July 1999.

Tariff reprint page Chapter 57/1 (R.1) was issued in conjunction with this change.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 4 (1999) was tabled in the House of Representatives on 2 September 1999. It
reinstates the 5% customs rate of duty on:

certain drawing, marking-out and mathematical calculating instruments of subheading 9017.20;
certain rules of wood or plastic and steel tape measures of subheading 9017.80;
certain gas, electrical and liquid meters of subheadings 9028.10, 9028.20 and 9028.30; and
certain machines for balancing mechanical parts and electrical test benches of subheadings 9031.10 and
9031.20.

Certain rates of customs duty on goods classified to tariff headings 9013 to 9033 in Schedule 3 to the Customs
Tariff were reduced to free on 1 September 1998 following the implementation of the recommendations of the
Industry Commission's report on the Medical and Scientific Industries.

Some Australian manufacturers of non-medical and non-scientific goods covered by these reductions informed
the Government that this removal of tariff assistance had affected their manufacturing viability and profitability. In
light of these representations, the 5% rate of duty was reinstated on the above goods from 3 September 1999.

Tariff reprint pages issued in relation to this change are Schedule 3 - 90/13 (R.3), 90/19 (R.3), 90/21 (R.5) and
90/23 (R.7). A concordance of tariff subheadings affected by these changes is attached to this Notice.

Any queries on these changes should be addressed to Ray Banvill on (02) 6275 6516.

EXPORT/EXIT SYSTEMS - CONTINGENCY ARRANGEMENTS

Introduction

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) replaces ACN No 96/13 and expands on the EXIT 1 contingency procedures briefly outlined in ACN 91/48. It advises of contingency
arrangements that will apply to the reporting of cargo for export if and when the Australian Customs Service (Customs) EXIT system suffers either:

a short term outage less than 48 hours; or
an extended outage greater than 48 hours.

The ACN applies to any short term or extended outage affecting EXIT, including potential Year 2000 related outages.

Customs will put in place and communicate contingency arrangements as outlined in this ACN. It is always Customs aim to deliver industry the best possible service under these
conditions while still ensuring that community protection and legislative compliance obligations continue to be met. Industry should therefore be aware that, under contingency
arrangements, export clearance service levels might not meet the levels achieved under regular automated systems.

EXIT contingency arrangements are broken into:

Short Term Contingency Arrangements (less than 48 hours) for Export Entry Processing (EXIT 1) and Export Manifest Processing (EXIT 2), as outlined in Sections 1 and 2 of this
ACN; and
Extended Outage Contingency Arrangements (greater than 48 hours) for EXIT 1 and EXIT 2, as outlined in Sections 3 and 4 of this ACN.

The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) provides a ""Single Electronic Window"" to EXIT 1 via their EXDOC system. The EXIT contingency arrangements for clients that
access the EXIT system via EXDOC are outlined in Section 5 of this ACN. AQIS also has contingency requirements that must be met in the event of any outage to the EXDOC system.

Customs State Notices complement this ACN in all regions. The State Notices detail specific Customs regional requirements and points of contact for the day-to-day administration and
operation under contingency conditions. Customs State Notices are published by each region and are available from Regional Customs Houses.

As any Year 2000 problems may include increased community and industry communication difficulties the following four points are specific to potential Year 2000 outages only. They do
not apply to outages at other times.

1. If EXIT is unavailable on 1 January 2000, short term contingency arrangements will be invoked by Customs as soon as practicable.
2. If EXIT is not available, and official advice in relation to system availability cannot be reasonably publicised to industry, industry should presume EXIT short term contingency

arrangements are in place. This can be confirmed by contacting either the local Customs Clearing section or the Customs EDS Help Desk.

3. If after 48 hours EXIT is still unavailable, and it is unlikely the system will become available in the near future, a declaration may be made by the National Manager Import/Export
Management Branch to invoke EXIT extended outage contingency arrangements as outlined in this ACN. This can be confirmed by reference to the ""EXIT EXTENDED OUTAGE
NOTICE"" that will be posted on the front door of affected Customs Premises. Advice will also be published in the media.

4. Such contingency arrangements will continue until such time as the EXIT system is available and contingency arrangements are officially declared to no longer apply. The cessation

of extended outage contingency arrangements will be communicated to the exporting industry by the means outlined in sub-sections 3.1 and 4.1 of this ACN.

Note: To the extent that it is reasonable and possible, industry are advised to consider pre-clearance of export cargo
scheduled for export during the Year 2000 changeover period.

CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSAL NO.7 (1999) NUISANCE

TARIFFS AND ADDITIONAL NOTE 2 TO CHAPTER 57

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 7 (1999), which is expected to be tabled in the House of Representatives in the week
commencing 6 December 1999, will give effect to the Government's decision to remove the customs duty on a
number of so called 'nuisance tariffs'. The tariff reductions will operate from 15 December 1999.

The decision is being implemented by introducing free rates of duty for 268 tariff subheadings. For most of these
subheadings the current duty rate will be repealed and replaced with a free rate of duty. Approximately forty
subheadings will be amalgamated with subheadings which are already free, to provide new composite
subheadings. This amalgamation is in line with the Government's policy of tariff simplification.

Attachment A is a list of the 268 tariff subheadings that will be reducing to free.

Attachment B contains the concordance of tariff subheadings.

Tariff reprint pages to be issued with this change are:

Schedule 3 - 11/3 (R.1), 15/5 (R.1), 17/3 (R.3), 19/3 (R.4), 20/3 (R.4), 20/5 (R.2), 22/5 (R.7), 25/7 (R.2), 25/9

CUSTOMS YEAR 2000 ROLLOVER ARRANGEMENTS

Customs has undertaken considerable work to ensure that its computer systems will not be effected by the Year
2000 changeover problem. As a final precaution however Customs will cease processing all data via Cargo
Management systems at 23:45pm AESST on 31 December 1999. At this time, as an additional safeguard, a
backup of the computer environment will be performed. Customs staff will be on site to monitor any issues which
may arise during this critical period.

Note: Customs computer network provider (Connect.com) has advised it will cease processing messages and
data at the earlier time of 23:00pm AESST. From a user perspective, systems will effectively become unavailable
from that time.

Normal operations will resume at 06:00am AESST at which time Customs staff will begin Year 2000 'verification
testing on Customs business critical computer systems. A trouble shooting checklist is attached to this notice for
use by Customs EDI clients. If an apparent year 2000 problem is encountered on 1 January 2000 the checklist
allows the user to identify non-year 2000 related problems before contacting Customs. If a problem is still
apparent after the checklist has been used, please contact Ada Polubinski on 0411 275855. Customs clients are
reminded that responsibility for Year 2000 compliance of their own internal systems and processes rests with
them. If Customs systems fail, contingency arrangements as published in ACN 99/72 and ACN 99/80 may be
invoked. If a client's own internal office systems and processes fail, that client will need to make alternate
arrangements J.H. Jeffery Acting Deputy Chief Executive Officer Australian Customs Service for Chief Executive

1. DON'T call Customs first, it is likely the fault is not in the Customs IT application. Please follow the instructions

below;

2. To assess if the problem is a Year 2000 compliance problem:

Contact your software provider to ensure that you are running a Year 2000 compliant version of the software.
Ensure that your hardware is Year 2000 compliant (eg a 386 or 486 PC is likely to fail).
Ensure any additional installed software products are Year 2000 compliant.
Ensure you have at least 'Windows 95' if your computer runs 'desktop products'.

1. To assess if the problem is a non-Year 2000 compliance related problem:

Check with the your Network Carrier Help Desk (TELSTRA on 1800 252390 or Connect.Com on 131357) to
verify they are processing messages.

If you have followed all the steps above and not resolved the problem then please report the fault to your

CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (ACIS IMPLEMENTATION)

ACT 1999

The Customs Tariff Amendment (ACIS Implementation) Act 1999 received Royal Assent on 3 November 1999
and is numbered Act No. 141 of 1999. This Act amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (""the Tariff""). An operative
date of 30 December 1999 has been proclaimed. Some of the new provisions contained in this Act have
immediate effect, while others will come into operation between now and 1 January 2005.

The changes which have immediate effect will:

amend current item 53 in Part III of Schedule 4 of the Tariff by inserting a new finishing date of 31 December
1999 and by deleting the word 'replacement' from the description of goods that are excluded from the phase-
down provisions of this item.
insert new item 53A to operate from 1 January 2000 until 30 June 2000. This item has similar provisions to
item 53 but will additionally exclude passenger motor vehicles and original assembly components for these
vehicles from the phase-down provisions of this item.
delete the word 'replacement', wherever occurring, from the description of goods in tariff items where the term
'replacement components' is used.

The remainder of the provisions enacted in this Act:

implement post-1 January 2005 passenger motor vehicle phase-downs. The criteria for and size of the
reductions were previously notified in ACN 97/72. Other details relevant to the phase-out of the developing
country tariff margin for DCS countries and Canada contained in that ACN are still applicable.
create new item 53B to operate from 1 July 2000 until 31 December 2004. This item has similar provisions to
item 53A. As tariffs for a range of textile articles and footwear goods will reduce to 15% on 1 July 2000, the
tariff items for these goods have been added to the list excluded from the phase-down provisions of this item.
create new item 53C to operate from 1 January 2005. This item has similar provisions to item 53B. However,
as the post-1 January 2005 phase-down of rates of duty for passenger motor vehicles and textiles, clothing
and footwear will be operative from this date, the reference to 'a general rate of duty of 15%' has been
amended to refer to 'a general rate of duty of 10%'. A similar list of excluded tariff items to that contained in
item 53B is appended to this item.
create new item 41E under which the new concessional tariff provisions of the Automotive Competitiveness
and Investment Scheme (ACIS) will operate. This scheme will not commence until 1 January 2001, and item
41E can only be used once credits have been issued under that scheme.

Tariff reprint pages for these changes will be issued in the new year with the exception of those for the
amendments to items 53, 53A and 53B in Schedule 4. These reprint pages are Schedule 4/25 (R.5) and 4/26A
(Original) and were despatched in the week commencing 13 December.

Any queries on ACIS should, in the first instance, be directed to the AusIndustry Hotline on 132 846. Tariff queries

COPYRIGHT ACT 1968 AMENDMENTS RELATING TO PACKAGING AND LABELLING

Copyright Amendment Act (No.1) 1998, made a number of amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 including provisions relating to packaging and labelling.

This Australian Customs Notice is to remind copyright owners who have lodged Notices of Objection with Customs of these amendments. Significant amendments, which have effect
from 1 February 2000, include:

amending the definition of an 'infringing copy';
defining an 'accessory';
defining a 'non-infringing accessory';
exempting the Olympic rings symbol (within the meaning of the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987) from the changes; and
exempting manuals sold with computer software from the changes.

The definition of 'accessory' includes labels, packaging and instructions. 'Non-infringing accessory' means accessories made in WTO member countries (current list attached) where the
owner of the copyright in that country authorised the making of the accessory.

The copyright in a work a copy of which is on, or embodied in, a non-infringing accessory to an article is not infringed by importing the accessory with the article.

In essence, the amendments will allow the importation of goods with copyright packaging or labelling without the permission of the copyright owner, if the owner of the copyright had
agreed to the use of the copyright material with the goods. The amendments will not, however, affect the operation of the law governing trade marks, insofar as the packaging or labelling
includes a trade mark.

Copyright owners who are uncertain about the impact of these amendments on their Notices of Objection are advised to seek legal advice.

Copies of the Copyright Amendment Act (No.1) 1998, and the Copyright Act 1968, are available from the Australian Government Printing Service.

Further information about copyright may be obtained by contacting:

the Intellectual Property Branch in the Attorney-General's Department which has produced a booklet on copyright law entitled 'Copyright Law in Australia: A Short Guide'. Copies may

INDEXATION OF CERTAIN EXCISE AND CUSTOMS TARIFF DUTY RATES AND THE DIESEL FUEL
REBATE

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer (except ""home brew""),
tobacco and certain petroleum products will change on and from 2 February 2000. Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment to this Notice provide the new rates.

Rates of duty are indexed by multiplying the current rates by a factor. This factor is calculated by dividing the most recent index number by the previous highest December or June index
number. Accordingly, the December 1999 index number (124.1) has been divided by the June 1999 number (122.3) to establish the indexation factor of 1.015.

In accordance with long-standing policy, where rates of excise and customs duty are indexed, complementary increases in the rates of diesel fuel rebate are also made. These increases
are effected by declarations under subsection 78A(5A) of the Excise Act 1901 and subsection 164(5A) of the Customs Act 1901. It is proposed that new declared rates of diesel fuel
rebate will be notified in the Commonwealth Gazette
GN 5 of 9 February 2000, effective on and from 2 February 2000. These rates are listed in Tables 3 and 4 of the Attachment to this Notice.

Actual rates of rebate payable can differ from these declared rates because of the averaging provisions of the rebate legislation. The rate applicable to a particular claim is shown on the
payment advice forwarded to claimants.

CUSTOMS ACT 1901 - PART XVB REVIEW OF NON-

INJURIOUS PRICES FOR CLEAR FLOAT GLASS FROM THE

PEOPLE`S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, THE PHILIPPINES AND

THAILAND

The Australian Customs Service will review the level of the non-injurious free-on board prices
(NIFOBs) in respect of clear float glass (CFG) exported to Australia from the
People's Republic of China (China), the Philippines and Thailand. This review was initiated at the request of the
Minister. It will be run in conjunction with the anti-dumping investigation presently under way into CFG exported to
Australia from Indonesia.

NIFOBs for CFG exported from China, the Philippines and Thailand are based on selling prices in Australia of
CFG exported from Indonesia (see Trade Measures Report No.6,which can be found on the internet at Report
06.)
 The current NIFOBs applying to CFG were thus set on the assumption that CFG exported from Indonesia was not
dumped. If, as a result of the current anti-dumping investigation, exports of Indonesian CFG to Australia are found
to have been dumped, Customs will review the method for setting the NIFOBs for China, the Philippines and
Thailand.

A notice advising initiation of this review was published in the AustralianFinancial Review on 11 February 2000.
Interested parties are invited to lodge submissions in response to that notice no later than the close of business
on Thursday 2 March 2000.

Parties should address their submission to:

Interested parties wishing to participate in the investigation must ensure that submissions are lodged promptly.

submission must be provided.

Non-confidential submissions, and a copy of relevant correspondence between Customs and other persons, will

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS

ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the Schedule of Notices of Objection, have given notice under Section 132 of
the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to
them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of
Objection remain in force for a period of two years from the commencement date shown for the particular trade
mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in
Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade
mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain
objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it
has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice
regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final
paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is
substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to be seized by
Customs, unless it can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or

- the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not,
amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions
of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially
identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.

The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish
to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each
State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of
Objection, or Customs' role in regard to those Notices, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and
Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs Service Office in their nearest capital city.

CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT ACT (NO. 1) 1999 TEXTILES,

CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR AMENDMENTS

Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 1999 received Royal Assent on 23 December 1999 and is numbered Act
No. 190 of 1999. It contains amendments which insert post-1 January 2005 textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF)
tariff phases and which repeal the TCF Import Credit Scheme from 1 July 2000.

The new phasing rates will apply as follows:

a 17.5% general rate for apparel and certain finishing textiles;

a 10% general rate for footwear, cotton sheeting and woven fabrics; and

a 7.5% general rate for footwear parts and other goods the subject of the TCF Import Credit Scheme which have
not been previously mentioned.

This Act also amends item 54 in Part III of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, under which the TCF
Import Credit Scheme is administered, by inserting a 30 June 2000 sunset provision for the operation of the
Scheme.

From 1 July 2000, the Textiles Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program (SIP) will supersede the TCF
Import Credit Scheme. This non-tariff assistance program will be administered by the Department of Industry,
Science and Resources.

The Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Act 1999, assented to on 23 December 1999
and numbered Act No. 182 of 1999, underpins the administrative arrangements for the SIP. It complements the
Government's decision to pause tariff reductions at year 2000 levels and maintain them at that level until 2005.

Under the SIP, TCF industries will be able to access grants, totalling $700 million, in respect of new TCF
plant/building expenditure, TCF research and development expenditure, TCF value added and secondhand plant
and ancillary expenditure in TCF-dependent communities.

Customs tariff reprint pages will be released to subscribers over the coming months.

Any queries on the SIP should be directed to the Ausindustry Hotline on 132 846. Tariff queries should be

CUSTOMS ACT 1901 - PART XVB CONTINUATION INQUIRY

BULK BRANDY EXPORTED FROM FRANCE

The
 Australian Customs Service has completed its inquiry into whether countervailing measures
currently applying to imports of bulk brandy (of alcoholic strength by volume exceeding
57%) from France should be continued for a further five years. The findings of Customs are
detailed in Trade Measures Report no. 14.

Customs is
satisfied that subsidies are still payable by the European Commission on bulk brandy
produced in France and that the subsidies are likely to continue for the foreseeable
future.

Customs is
also satisfied that the expiration of the countervailing duty would be likely to lead to a
continuation of the subsidisation and the material injury that the duty was intended to
prevent.

In the light
of the above, Customs has recommended that the Minister take action to continue the
countervailing duty for a further five years.

The Minister
for Justice and Customs has accepted Customs recommendation and, as a consequence, the
countervailing measures will continue until 27 February 2005.

A printed
version of Trade Measures Report No. 14 is expected to be available shortly. A copy of the
summary page from the Report is attached.

A copy of
Report No. 14 will be sent to each of those parties who made submissions to the inquiry.
Copies will also be available on request from Phil Hilyard, Trade Measures Branch, at

REVOKED 3 FEBRUARY 2014 (SEE AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS AND BORDER
PROTECTION NOTICE NO. 2014/04)

Australian Business Number (ABN); Linking ABNs to Owner

Codes

BACKGROUND

As part of the New Tax System, the Government has introduced a single business identifier, the Australian
Business Number (""ABN""). It will allow businesses to have a single business identifier for all Commonwealth
purposes. The system will be available to State, Territory and local government bodies to facilitate use of a single
identifying number for dealings with government at all levels.

Customs will introduce the use of the ABN into the COMPILE system from 1 July 2000.

ABN Format

The ABN is an eleven digit number. If a branch of an entity is registered by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
as a GST branch, the branch will also be allocated a three digit trailer to the ABN, known as a Client Activity
Centre (CAC).

COMPILE

The COMPILE system currently uses an owner code as the means of identifying importers. The owner code will
continue to be used by COMPILE for internal processing, but importers will be required to quote their ABN on
Customs entries for identification purposes. Importers will not be able to defer GST on imported goods unless
they quote their ABN on the import entry.

Linking ABNs to Owner Codes

In order to enable importers to use their ABN on COMPILE entries, ABN holders will be required to link their ABN
to their existing or new owner code. An ABN can only be linked to an owner code on a strict one-to-one basis.

COMPILE users will be able to establish this link through the COMPILE COS File. Users should display an owner
code record from the COS File and input the appropriate ABN in the new ABN field. The name and address fields
must be blanked out.

New importers will create an owner code record as they do now and will include their ABN at the same time. The
system will create a new owner code linked to the ABN. The name and address fields do not have to be provided.

When the link is made, COMPILE will ensure that the ABN is valid and has not been linked to another owner
code. COMPILE will then transfer the ABN name and address from the ABN File to the COS File record.

A CAC does not need to be entered unless the entity is registered as a GST branch, in which case the input of a
CAC is mandatory.

Changing Links

Users should be aware that once an ABN has been linked to an owner code it will be locked in. The link can only
be changed by contacting the Customs User Liaison section. The User Liaison section will require a letter from
the importer detailing the owner code and ABN that they wish to use.

Timing of Changes

The link facility is being introduced well in advance of 1 July 2000 to enable COMPILE users sufficient preparation
time to determine their clients ABNs and establish the owner code links.

DEFERRAL OF GST ON IMPORTED GOODS

The Assistant Treasurer has announced details of arrangements to allow importers to defer the payment of GST
on imported goods.

The Deferred GST Scheme provides for GST to be deferred until the first Business Activity Statement (BAS) is
due after the goods are entered for home consumption. These arrangements are designed to put importers on an
equal footing, in regard to the payment of GST by a registered business on imported goods, compared with
goods obtained locally.

What is the scope of the scheme?

Deferral of GST on imported goods will extend to all importations that are entered for home consumption. (Nature
10 and Nature 30 entries). Goods imported under the TEXCO scheme and the proposed TRADEX scheme that
are diverted into home consumption, are excluded from the scheme. Low value imports cleared on informal
clearance documents will also be excluded.

Who is eligible to defer GST?

Importers will only be eligible to defer GST if they:

have an Australian Business Number;
are registered for the GST;
lodge their BAS monthly, via the Internet-based, e-commerce system operated by the Australian Taxation
Office (ATO);
pay their BAS liabilities electronically;
deal with Customs electronically;
as a general rule, do not have any debt or returns outstanding with the ATO;
have received approval in writing from the ATO to defer payment of GST.

How will the GST deferral scheme operate?

After 1 July 2000, importers will quote their Australian Business Number to Customs when they enter goods for
home consumption.

If the importer has been given approval to defer GST, Customs will release the goods after payment of any
customs duty or other charges. Customs will record the deferred GST liability of each shipment as it is cleared.

At the end of each month, Customs will advise the ATO of the total deferred GST liability for each importer who
deferred GST.

The ATO will include the amount of deferred GST on the BAS before it is issued to each participant. In this way,
the amount of deferred GST liability is included in the calculation of net liability in the BAS for the month.

The BAS must be lodged with the ATO within 21 days from the end of the month. Importers will be able to offset
the deferred GST liability by claiming an input tax credit to the extent that the imported goods are used in carrying
on an enterprise.

Need more information?

Details of the arrangements can be obtained by contacting the Deferred GST Scheme Helpline 1300 130 915.

How to apply to participate in the scheme?

Importers can apply to participate on-line on the ATOAssist web site located at www.ato.gov.au.

Australian Customs Service Manual Volume 9 contains information related solely to excisable goods. It has been 
deleted from the list of the Australian Customs Service Manuals.

Australian Customs Service Manual Volume 10 contains information relating to excisable goods and policy and 
procedures regarding Customs warehouses and duty free shops. References to excise are being removed from 
Volume 10 and the Customs information in that Manual is being updated. At the completion of this process an

RELATED PRODUCTS

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2000) was tabled in Parliament on 9 March 2000. The Proposal imposed, from 10
March 2000, an excise equivalent duty on imported toluene and related products (benzene, xylenes and mixed
alkylbenzenes) of Chapters 29 and 38 of the Customs Tariff, to minimise the potential revenue loss through fuel
substitution activities.

The Customs Regulations 1926 have also been amended to insert refund circumstances where these products
have been used otherwise than as a fuel or have been packaged, after delivery into home consumption, into a
package of not more than 210 litres capacity and the product has been sold in that packaging, for use otherwise
than as a fuel. A remission circumstance has also been inserted that applies to these products if they have been
delivered, for use otherwise than as a fuel, in accordance with a permission given under section 69 of
the Customs Act 1901 which is expressed to be given for the purpose of use otherwise than as a fuel. These
amendments were contained in the Customs Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1) (Statutory Rules 2000 No.
13).

Customs tariff reprint pages issued in conjunction with this change are: Tariff Act 15 (R.5), Schedule 3 29/7 (R.5),

The Customs Regulations 1926 have also been amended to insert refund circumstances where these products
have been used otherwise than as a fuel or have been packaged, after delivery into home consumption, into a
package of not more than 210 litres capacity and the product has been sold in that packaging, for use otherwise
than as a fuel. A remission circumstance has also been inserted that applies to these products if they have been
delivered, for use otherwise than as a fuel, in accordance with a permission given under section 69 of
the Customs Act 1901 which is expressed to be given for the purpose of use otherwise than as a fuel. These
amendments were contained in the Customs Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1) (Statutory Rules 2000 No.
13).

Amendments to Customs Refund Regulations 126, 127, and

128

A number of changes to the refund regulations have been made, which become effective on 1 June 2000 and 17
June 2000. The changes in the main are amendments to existing regulations that address simple procedural
matters as well as the removal of redundant and inconsistent wordings to make the regulations easier to
understand.

Important changes have also been made to the regulations relating to the refund application fee and a new refund
circumstance has been introduced to allow for a refund of duty to apply when automotive components and certain
passenger motor vehicles are donated to educational institutions. The amendments also prescribe certain
consequential regulation amendments that became necessary upon the commencement of Schedule 1 to
the Customs Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) 1999 on 4 May 2000 ('the ELOR legislation').

Refund Review Amendments

In May/June 1999, a number of Public Information Seminars announced by

ACN 99/37, were conducted in conjunction with the Customs Broker's Council of Australia. These seminars
outlined prospective amendments to the refund regulations that followed an internal review of the refund
circumstances. The internal review was conducted as a forerunner to the introduction of the Electronic
Lodgement of Refunds ('ELOR'). The amendments to the regulations, foreshadowed at these seminars, have
now been made.

The amendments are designed to make the refund regulations clearer to understand and easier to administer.
They are not intended to extend or limit the coverage of the existing operable refund circumstances except to
remedy deficiencies or where it is necessary for clarity. A synopsis of these amendments is set out in Attachment
A to this notice.

Refund Application Fees

Two important changes have been made to the regulations relating to the refund application fee.

First, a new subregulation, [128AA(3)] has been introduced to allow successful parties in Administrative Appeals
Tribunal ('AAT') proceedings, relating to Commercial Tariff Concession Orders ('CTCO') and Tariff Concession
Orders ('TCO'), to make an application for refund in certain circumstances without having to pay the refund
application fee.

When the Chief Executive Officer makes a decision in relation to a TCO or a CTCO those affected by that
decision may apply to the AAT to have that decision reviewed. As a result of a decision of the AAT it may be that
a TCO or CTCO will come into effect retrospectively.

In these circumstances, importers may be entitled to a refund. New subregulation 128AA(3) provides that where
this circumstance occurs, the parties to the AAT proceedings do not have to pay the refund application fee when
they apply for the relevant refund of duty.

A person will be a party to proceedings if they fall within the meaning of paragraph 30(1)(a) or (d) of
the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975.

Secondly, a new regulation [128AC] has been made under s 163(1D)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 ('the Customs
Act'). The regulation prescribes that from 17 June 2000 the fee payable on refund applications made in an
approved form will be $45.00.

The current fee for those refund applications created electronically is $45.00 and for those made in an approved
form the fee is $65.00. For a period of time from

17 June 2000 applicants will not be able to electronically create refund applications on the COMPILE computer
system. During this period it will be necessary for applicants to apply for a refund in the approved form. The new
regulation will ensure that those applicants who currently have the benefit of paying the lower fee will not be
disadvantaged.

Attachment A to ACN 2000/20 Refund Review Amendments

Amendments to Subregulation 126(1)

Paragraphs 126(1) (a), (b) and (c) have been restructured to reflect modern cargo
handling procedures and to more appropriately cover the pre and post Customs
control aspects of these circumstances. The loss and pillage circumstances have been
combined into one paragraph [126(1)(c)]. To compliment this restructuring a definition
of place of export has been included in the new subregulation 126(1A).

Subparagraph 126(1)(da)(i) has been amended to make it clear that the entry must
have been withdrawn under section 71F before the refund is made. This overcomes a
technical deficiency in the current provisions.

Paragraphs 126(1) (g) &amp; (h) have been amended and restructured to make them
clearer. While both provisions relate to goods that are faulty, defective or do not
conform to contract specifications an important difference relates to the redress
available to the applicant. If the importer has tried to obtain redress from the
manufacturer or supplier but has been unsuccessful the claim should be made under
refund circumstance 126(1)(h). If redress has been obtained the refund should be
claimed under 126(1)(g). The provisions now make this clear and also now include the
condition that a Collector must be satisfied that all conditions have been met.

Current paragraphs 126(1) (fb), (ga), (n), (t), (u), (x) and (y) have been repealed as
these circumstances are redundant.

Amendments to regulation 127

Two new subregulations [127(3A) &amp; (3B)] have been introduced to make it clear
that if the goods, the subject of the application, have received a Drawback of all the
duty paid they will not be eligible for refund. If part of the duty has not been
drawnback then that part will still be eligible for a refund.

Subregulation 127(4) has been amended. The amendment will affect goods covered by
the new circumstances in paragraphs 126(1)(a), (b) and (d) that are to be destroyed. It
will no longer be mandatory that Customs supervise the destruction of these goods.
Customs must be notified that the goods are going to be destroyed. A refund on the
goods will only be paid if the goods are destroyed under the supervision of an officer or
the goods are destroyed after Customs tells the person who made the notification that
the goods can be destroyed.

New subregulation 127(4B) aligns refund circumstances 126(1)(g) and (h) with other
circumstances by providing conditions as to the disposal of the goods concerned and
provides the discretion for the Collector to authorise that the goods be dealt with other
than by exportation or destruction.

A number of consequential amendments have also been made to regulation 127 due to
re-numbering and the omission or inclusion of new provisions.

REDEVELOPMENT OF THE TARIFF AND PRECEDENTS

INFORMATION NETWORK - TAPIN

Background

The Tariff and Precedents Information Network (TAPIN) is an on-line mainframe computer
based system designed to assist Customs officers, Customs Brokers and the general
importing community to obtain the correct rate of Customs duty payable on imported goods.

TAPIN Redevelopment

The redevelopment of TAPIN has been progressing over the past two years. As a result, a
component of TAPIN is being moved off the mainframe computer and modernised.

A message informing all TAPIN users of this change was placed on TAPIN NEWS file in
February 1999. An updated message was published as a COMPILE message on 2 November 1999.
For details on the changes and impact on TAPIN users refer to previous messages.

Implementation of Redeveloped TAPIN

Redeveloped TAPIN is scheduled to be implemented on 27 - 28 May 2000. TAPIN will be
unavailable from close of business on Friday, 26 May 2000 until start of business on
Monday, 29 May 2000.

Changes and Impact on TAPIN users

There will be two major changes in the redeveloped TAPIN system. Those changes have been
the subject of discussions with Customs Brokers Council of Australia Inc (CBCA), which has
in turn consulted with TAPIN users.

The first change involves the search capability of Tariff Advices (TA) and Valuation
Advices (VA). The searches will be limited to the more popular search criteria.

The second change involves the reference information in TAPIN. This information will be
available only to Customs officers. Most of the reference information is available to
other TAPIN users through TariffTech, a product of Digerati. Advice from CBCA is that
TariffTech is widely used and accepted by industry.

Information on Digerati can be obtained from their web site, www.digerati.com.au
or by telephone 03 9859 5800.

TEMPORARY IMPORT PROVISIONS and #8211; EXPORT
REPORTING AND ACQUITTAL PROCESS

Background This ACN supplements ACN 99/69, which detailed additional legislative provisions introduced to 
cover the duty free admission of goods temporarily imported under section 162A of the Customs Act 1901 ('the 
Act'). These provisions affect both goods for use in, or for purposes related to, the Sydney 2000 Olympic and 
Paralympic Games (Olympics) and associated events, and goods eligible for admission under international 
Customs Conventions which arrive without a carnet. Under the additional provisions, goods temporarily imported 
under section 162A of the Act (regulations 125 and 125A of the Customs Regulations 1926 (""the Regulations"")) 
that are subsequently intended for export require an application for permission to take the goods aboard a ship or 
aircraft in accordance with section 162AA of the Act. That permission is in the same format as an export entry. 
Changes have been made to export reporting requirements and the EXIT system to take account of these 
legislative amendments. Application For Permission to Export

Goods temporarily imported under section 162A of the Act that are subsequently intended for export will require 
the lodgement of an application for permission to take goods aboard a ship or aircraft for export, in accordance 
with section 162AA of the Act. The format of the application for permission to export and an export entry are the 
same. Therefore an electronic application for permission to export can be lodged through EXIT, while a 
documentary application for permission to export can be lodged using the B957 &amp; B957(a) approved form 
(Export Entry). A new Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) code, 9902.20.05, has 
been created for the export reporting of Olympic goods temporarily imported. Non-Olympic temporarily imported 
goods can be reported for export using AHECC codes 9902.20.12 or 9902.20.22, for cargo or non-cargo 
respectively. The exemptions to export entry reporting requirements specified in subsection 113(2) of the Act do 
not apply to applications for permission to export temporarily imported goods. Acquittal of Goods Temporarily 
Imported Under Section 162A

There currently exists in EXIT and on the B957(a) a provision for an export permit number to be reported to 
Customs on an application for permission to export/export entry. The application for permission to export/export 
entry permit field exists to allow the relevant permit/licence numbers to be quoted in situations where goods 
subject to export controls are intended for export. Each export Permit Issuing Agency (PIA) has been provided 
with a unique 3 alpha permit prefix code that forms part of the permit/licence number (eg. OZO for the Ozone 
Protection Section of Environment Australia). Where goods that were imported pursuant to a permission under 
section 162A of the Act the following unique 'permit' prefix should be used - TIP. The format of input of the import 
entry number into the application for permission to export/export entry permit field is as follows:

TIP1M92560001K

In situations where an import entry number was not generated (eg. Informal Clearance Document), the following
should be input into the permit field:

TIPMANUAL

EXIT will return an Export Clearance Number (ECN) in error where the aforementioned details are not input into
the permit field for temporarily imported Olympic goods classified to AHECC code 9902.20.05. The EXIT error
message will be error code 0008 - 'permit required none given'. Where applicable, Customs Brokers must provide
the import entry number to owners of temporarily imported goods so that this information can be provided to the
owner's export forwarding agent. Further information can be obtained through the nominated officers in the
Regional Securities/Auxiliaries area (refer to contact details at attachment 'D' of ACN 99/69). Lucy Bitmead

Cargo Reporting Procedure for High Volume Low Value

Consignments

This notice outlines new cargo reporting procedures for certain categories of import cargo that may be described
as high volume low value cargo - specifically bulk document consignments and bulk mail order consignments.
The Customs Amendment Act (No. 1) 2000 and the Import Processing Charges Amendment Act 2000 give effect
to the new high volume low value cargo reporting arrangements (""the Scheme""), which will commence on 1
August 2000.

Overview

Under the auspices of the Government's ""Tough on Drugs"" initiative, Customs has determined that bulk document
consignments represent a high risk in regard to the importation of illicit drugs and other prohibited goods into
Australia. Bulk document consignments, which continue to grow in volume annually, are currently not reported to
Customs in any detail. The new Scheme will require the provision of a level of reporting information that will
enable Customs to individually risk assess each item, thereby enhancing Customs ability to target high risk
consignments.

Additionally, Customs has assessed that certain pre-determined categories of bulk mail order product may
represent a relatively low risk to Customs if they are packaged and consigned in a particular manner. The
Scheme introduces new arrangements to facilitate the reporting and clearance of certain eligible bulk mail order
goods, thereby reducing Customs screening workload and minimising delivery delays.

In the case of high volume low value goods generally, Customs has identified certain inconsistencies in the
application of cost recovery charges under the Import Processing Charges Act 1997, based upon how this
category of cargo is being reported to Customs. Some freight forwarders electronically report the details of each
consignment at the house air waybill level and pay cost recovery charges accordingly, while others do not make a
complete report in accordance with the Act.

The new Scheme provides for the reporting of high volume low value cargo consignments in accordance with
section 64AB of the Customs Act 1901 (""the Act""), while removing any inconsistencies in the application of cost
recovery practices. It enables a cargo reporter of high volume low value consignments registered under the
Scheme (to be known as a ""special reporter"") to make abbreviated reports of eligible consignments at the sub-
master air waybill (SMAWB) level.

Such a report may be made by transmitting minimal details to the Customs Air Cargo Automation (ACA) system -
provided the consignment details which would otherwise have been reported to Customs are available at least 2
hours prior to the arrival of the aircraft and are retained by the special reporter within its own electronic recording
system.

However, on request, special reporters will be required to electronically download information at the consignment
level to Customs ahead of aircraft arrival for screening and targeting purposes.

A key objective of the new Scheme is to facilitate the provision of real time information, where required, to allow
Customs to risk assess consignment details for community protection purposes. In addition, Customs officers will
now have specific monitoring powers to access a special reporter's premises, subject to the consent of the
special reporter, to screen and audit all consignment details reported under the Scheme.

The Import Processing Charges Amendment Act 2000 introduces a new screening charge of $45.00 for each
SMAWB reported under the Scheme instead of $2.40 for each line of the cargo report.

The nature of high volume low value cargo

Low value cargo means each consignment must have:

a value of less than $250 and therefore not be subject to entry requirements (paragraph 68(1)(f) of the Act);
and

Customs has discontinued a review of normal values and NIFOBs applying to PVC exported to Australia from 
Japan, Thailand and USA. On 9 August 1999 Chemiplas Australia Pty Limited (Chemiplas) applied to Customs 
for a review of normal values and NIFOBs applying to exports of PVC from Japan and USA. The Thai 
Government had previously applied for a review of normal values and NIFOBs applying to exports of PVC from 
Thailand. Both requests claimed that changed VCM prices had affected PVC prices on the domestic markets of 
nominated exporting countries and Australia. VCM accounts for approximately 70% of the production costs of 
PVC. Customs was satisfied that the evidence warranted a review. The review was notified in Australian Customs 
Dumping Notice (ACDN) No. 99/035 ( PDF 79KB) and in the Australian Financial Review of 3 September 1999. A 
statement of the essential facts (SEF) of the review (SEF No. 15) was placed on the public file on 29 November 
1999 and a copy sent to all interested parties. In SEF No. 15 Customs notified its intention to discontinue the 
review because insufficient information had been provided. Responses to the statement were considered. The 
Minister responsible for Customs has agreed with Customs decision to discontinue the review and normal values 
and NIFOBs applying to PVC exported to Australia from Japan, Thailand and USA will remain unchanged. Paul

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRADEX SCHEME

On 23 June 2000, the Tradex Scheme (Tradex) will be implemented. Tradex is an industry assistance programme which will allow for the importation of goods without payment of
customs duty or other taxes, provided the goods are subsequently exported or incorporated in other goods which are exported.

The Tradex Scheme Act 1999 is the legislative basis giving effect to the Scheme.

Tradex will replace the existing Tariff Export Concession Scheme (TEXCO). However, to achieve a seamless transition, there will be a short period during which both schemes will run
concurrently. Termination date for TEXCO will be 14 July 2000.

The scheme will be administered by AusIndustry, a division within the Department of Industry, Science and Resources. Importers wishing to utilise the Tradex Scheme may apply to
AusIndustry for a tradex order, as defined in section 4 of the Tradex Scheme Act 1999, nominating the goods they wish to import.

If the Secretary of the Department of Industry, Science and Resources (""the Secretary"") is satisfied of those things set out in section 11 of the Tradex Scheme Act 1999, the Secretary
must make a tradex order. A tradex order will allow the use of item 21A of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to effect concessional entry of the nominated goods.

Current TEXCO users may transfer to TRADEX by notifying AusIndustry of their wish to do so, prior to the commencement of the scheme.

Other importers wishing to use the Tradex Scheme should make an application to the Secretary for a tradex order in relation to the nominated goods. Contact numbers for AusIndustry

for Customs entry purposes. The notice also outlines owners responsibilities under the various sections of
the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act), and who is the importer for the purposes of the A New Tax System (Goods
and Services Tax) Act 1999 (GST Act).

Background

The Customs Act requires the owner of goods to enter them and pay Customs duty if applicable. The GST Act
requires the importer to pay GST payable on a taxable importation (sections 13-15 and 33-15) and entitles
that importer to an input tax credit if the importations of the goods are creditable importations (section 15-15).

There are a number of trading arrangements where the overseas supplier of goods undertakes to import them
into Australia and deliver them to the premises of the Australian purchaser. These transactions are sometimes
referred to as Free into Store (FIS) contracts and Landed into Store (LIS) contracts.

The correct commercial terminology is contained in the publication ""Incoterms"", published by the International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC). An FIS transaction is given the Incoterm Delivered Duty Paid (DDP), and an LIS
contract has the Incoterm Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU).

DDP denotes the seller's MAXIMUM obligation. The term means that the seller undertakes to deliver the goods
right to the buyer's nominated premises in the country of importation.

The SELLER is responsible for:

Putting the contract goods at the disposal of the buyer, duty paid

- at the named place of destination

- on the date or within the period stipulated, and

- supplying all necessary documents to enable the purchaser to take delivery of the
goods.

The BUYER is responsible for accepting the goods at the named place of destination and for paying for them.

DDU is similar to DDP except that the buyer must pay, where applicable, the costs of customs formalities as well
as all duties, taxes and other charges payable upon import of the goods. The industry does not make consistent
use of these terms. Some parties use the DDP term even when the goods are duty free or duty free under a
concession, while others choose to use DDU for this purpose.

Some difficulties arise with DDP/DDU transactions in determining who is the owner of imported goods for the
purposes of the various provisions of the Customs Act:

Penalty provisions, section 243T
Retention of documents, section 240
Duty shortpaid or erroneously refunded, section 165

Owner for Customs entry purposes

CHEESE AND CURD TARIFF QUOTA - ALLOCATIONS FOR

2000-2001

The Australian Customs Service has advised importers of their allocation of cheese and curd quota for the period
1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.

Allocations have been based on the actual usage of quota in the 23 months ending 31 May 2000, as shown in
Customs records of clearances for home consumption. The 23 month period has been chosen to reflect the most
recent usage of quota.

The calculation of an importer's quota entitlement excludes any quota transferred to another importer during the
23 month period or unused as at 31 May 2000.

Importers are reminded that quota is allocated for a particular financial year and that to use their quota allocation
they are required to 'enter for home consumption' the cheese or curd by the end of the financial year to which the
allocation relates, ie by 30 June. For the cheese or curd to be 'entered for home consumption' by 30 June, an
entry for the goods must be lodged with Customs and the vessel or aircraft carrying the goods must have arrived
at the first Australian port or airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged.

If either condition is not met by 30 June, the goods are taken to have been 'entered for home consumption' in the
following financial year. In such circumstances, the goods can be entered:

under quota for that financial year (if the importer has sufficient quota for that year); or
without quota at the rate of customs duty applicable to the relevant subheading of Schedule 3 of the Customs
Tariff.

Quota allocations are transferable between importers. An application to transfer quota entitlements may be made
by completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) and submitting it to:

Director Tariff Concessions
Australian Customs Service
Customs House
5 Constitution Avenue
CANBERRA CITY ACT 2601

Applicants are reminded that transfer applications are dealt with strictly in order of receipt and may take up to four
working days to process. This processing time is suspended when it is necessary to return an incomplete or
incorrect application, and resumes when the application is returned. Applications should be submitted well in
advance of intended use.

Please note that quota transfer form B235 has been revised and a copy of the new form has been sent to each
quota holder. All future applications for transfer of quota should be made on the new form. Additional copies of
that form and further information on the Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme may be obtained from Renata
Menkarska by telephoning (02) 6275 5802.

CUSTOMS ACT 1901 - PART XVB Section 269ZJ INTERESTED

PARTIES RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION TO THE PUBLIC

RECORD PROVISION OF NON-CONFIDENTIAL VERSIONS OF

SUBMISSIONS

Customs reminds parties lodging submissions to dumping and countervailing investigations that they must also
provide a non-confidential version of that submission for the public record.

Parties should ensure that non-confidential versions enable a reasonable understanding of the substance of the
information submitted in confidence. In some circumstances where a party claims, and the CEO accepts, that
information is confidential and would adversely affect that person's business or commercial interests even if
published in a non-confidential manner, a party may give a summary of the information. It is only in exceptional
circumstances that a party is not required to submit such a summary.

Parties' present practice of simply deleting information in relation to costs or prices does not meet non-
confidential requirements. In such circumstances the party should provide a non-confidential version which gives
broad indicators of the information that has been provided.

An example would be to provide figures within a specified range (e.g. 10 per cent) of actual figures. Alternatively
a party can use figures (or chart or other diagrammatic form) that express proportional increase or decrease in
costs and or prices.

The same considerations also apply when a party is submitting to or responding to a question of material injury.
The basis of the claim or rebuttal of the claim should be in a form that enables the other party to be aware of the
particular areas of dispute.

Customs may disregard confidential information in its consideration of a case if a non-confidential version is not
provided.

Where a party questions the process (ie. Customs conduct of the case), such comments are not of themselves
confidential. Customs will place these comments on the public record.

As a matter of administrative convenience, Customs does prepare non-confidential versions of its reports of visits
to local industry, importers and exporters. In these circumstances the company the subject of the report is obliged
to either accept Customs version or submit its own version.

Background

The CEO is required to make all the decisions under s. 267ZJ of the Act in relation to the question of accepting
claims of confidentiality and of non-confidential summaries.

Sections 269ZJ (5) and (6) of the Act provide that if the CEO disagrees with the party's claim of confidentiality and
the party refuses either to include the information in the public record or to prepare a summary, the CEO may
disregard the information, unless the information is demonstrated to be correct.

Australia's legislation is consistent with the World Trade Organization's Dumping and Subsidies agreements.

A list of what is regarded as confidential and non-confidential information is attached.

AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS SERVICE: CHANGES TO PRICES

FOR THE 2000/2001 FINANCIAL YEAR PERIOD

The Australian Customs Service wishes to notify that some changes to prices are required as a result of the
introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST). These changes to prices are listed below.

BACKGROUND

As part of the New Tax System, Customs is required to increase some of its prices in accordance with the GST. In
compliance with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Guidelines, Customs will not pass on the
full 10% GST, but will increase prices of GST liable supplies by 8.4%. This reflects the anticipated savings that
will be received from the abolition of the Whole Sales Tax (WST) system. Please note that the Executive Council
will not formally approve these changes in prices until 21 June 2000.

All Customs cost recovery charges were listed in the Treasurers Determination made under Section 81 of the
New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act with the exception of Location, Overtime and Travel Fees. The
new prices of these services, inclusive of GST are listed below. These new prices will come into effect on 1 July
2000. All other cost recovery charges were reviewed in May 2000 and prices will remain as previously notified.

Location Fees: $40.10 per hour or part thereof;

Overtime Fees: $43.35 per hour or part thereof;

Travel Costs: $0.58 cents per kilometre

General enquires regarding prices of services should be directed to Richard Murray, Management Accounting
Services, in Canberra on 02 6275 6468 or fax 02 6275 5779.

UNACCOMPANIED PERSONAL EFFECTS STATEMENT

Due to the impending introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and other legislative changes the
Unaccompanied Personal Effects Statement (Form B534) has been reviewed and amended to replace references
to Sales Tax information.

The opportunity was also taken to simplify the form and to accommodate the move towards joint clearance of
Unaccompanied Personal Effects (UPEs) by Australian Customs Service (Customs) and Australian Quarantine
and Inspection Service (AQIS).

These initiatives are expected to improve the service currently provided to industry and the public. The old Form
B534 has been redesigned as a joint agency form for use by both Customs and AQIS which will streamline the
clearance of UPEs. Changes to the format and content of the form will simplify the clearance process, lead to
greater efficiency and improved co-ordination of processing by both agencies.

The new Form B534 reduces the number of documents that need to be presented for clearance as separate
authorisation is no longer required where the importer nominates someone else to clear goods on their behalf.
This authority has been included on the new form.

The new Form B534 can be used immediately and an Internet version will be available from 1 July 2000. After 1
July 2000, the old Form B534 will no longer be accepted for processing. The new form is currently only available
in English. It is expected that it will be translated into other required languages by the end of September 2000.

TERMINATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO THE YEAR 2000 FOR THE

AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY

On 31 December 2000, the export facilitation scheme ('EFS') under the Administrative Arrangements for the automotive industry will expire. A new scheme, the Automotive
Competitiveness and Investment Scheme ('ACIS') will be introduced on 1 January 2001. The commencement of ACIS will see the cessation of the passenger motor vehicle ('PMV')
producers' 15 per cent entitlement to duty-free importation.

In order to effect the closure of the EFS and PMV producers' entitlement, the following actions are proposed:

1. Item 41A of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff 1995 (the Customs Tariff) will be revoked with effect from midnight on 31 December 2001. Determinations made for the purposes of this

concession will allow export credits to be used to offset duty payable on eligible imports up until this date. By-law BL 9640015 made for the purposes of item 41A of Schedule
4, supporting the operation of the EFS, will be revoked with effect from midnight on 31 December 2001.

2. Item 41B of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff will be replaced with a narrower concession, with changes to take effect from midnight on 31 December 2000. The narrower concession

will not extend to goods previously covered by the PMV producers' 15 per cent entitlement to duty-free importation. As a result, from 1 January 2001, the importation of original
components for use in the manufacture of vehicles by PMV producers will be subject to the relevant duty rates set out in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff. However, duty liabilities will
be able to be offset at the time of importation by the use of:

EFS export credits through item 41A until 31 December 2001; or
ACIS credits through item 41E from 1 January 2001 (see below).

The narrower concession will continue to assist the Australian heavy commercial motor vehicle (HCMV) and HCMV component industries. It will
cover original components for use in the assembly or manufacture of vehicles of a kind, which if imported, would be classified under one of the
following headings or subheadings of Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff (as prescribed by by-law):

8701.20.00 Road tractors for semi-trailers

8701.90.20 Tractors for dumpers

8702

Motor vehicles of various engine types and capacities principally designed for the transport of persons, excluding vehicles of 8702, PMVs and vehicles such as those

CUSTOMS ACT 1901 - PART XVB REVIEW FINDING ON BULK

BRANDY EXPORTED FROM FRANCE

In ACDN 2000/14 of 22 March 2000, Customs notified a review under subsection 269ZC(4) of the countervailing
duty applicable to bulk brandy exported to Australia from France.

Customs has completed its review and has found that each of the variable factors relevant to the determination of
the countervailable duty had changed. These variable factors are the non-injurious free on board price and the
countervailable subsidy amount. Accordingly, Customs recommended in its report to the Minister (Trade
Measures Report No. 25) that the level of the variable factors be revised. A summary of the report is attached.

The Minister has accepted Customs recommendations.

The changes will be notified in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and in the Australian Financial Review on
7 September 2000. The re-ascertained measures will not be included as publication may adversely affect the
business or commercial interests of certain interested parties.

Bona fide importers of the goods subject to the review may obtain details of the revised measures from the
Customs office where they normally conduct their business.

A copy of the Trade Measures Report No. 25 will be sent to all those who have participated in the inquiry.
Requests for copies of the report may be directed to Phil Hilyard, Trade Measures Office Management, Canberra,

INTERSTATE MOVEMENT OF UNDERBOND CONSOLIDATED

CARGO

In order to further streamline the delivery of imported cargo, the Australian Customs Service (Customs) proposes
to allow, under certain circumstances, the direct interstate underbond movement of consolidated air cargo at the
master air waybill (MAWB) level from a discharge port cargo terminal operator's (CTO) premises to the consignee
freight forwarder's section 77G licensed depot in the port of destination.

Currently, where a consolidation master air waybill has different discharge and destination ports, the cargo must
move to a CTO in the destination port nominated by the discharge port CTO, prior to underbond movement to the
freight forwarders premises. This procedure, until recently, reflected standard industry practice. However,
increasing commercial pressures have necessitated a review of these types of movements and the air cargo
industry has asked that new procedures be approved by Customs.

It is Customs intention, under Cargo Management Re-engineering (CMR), that this type of underbond procedure
be accommodated. However, in anticipation of the implementation of CMR, Customs in consultation with industry,
has agreed to the following arrangements.

Consolidation MAWBs with different discharge and destination ports cited on the air waybill may move underbond
directly to the interstate licensed premises of the freight forwarder cited as the consignee, where the following
conditions have been met;

all associated cargo reports meet the timeframes imposed under section 64AB of the Customs Act 1901;
cargo must be fully accounted for prior to underbond movement from the discharge port CTO;
the discharge port CTO does not require the cargo to be moved to a destination port CTO;
the cargo consists only of shipper packed units or pallets. No loose or general cargo will be included in the unit
by the airline;
the freight forwarder in the destination port undertakes to forgo the option of post flight encapsulation for all
cargo reported by the forwarder in that port;
the freight forwarder in the destination port obtains permission from Customs for the receipt and sending of Air
Cargo Automation (ACA) underbond messages at the MAWB level;
the underbond applicant takes full responsibility for the cargo while it is moving and until received by the
freight forwarder at the destination premise; and
the facility will not be used for any other purpose.

The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) will monitor and if necessary restrict the movement of
'high risk' interstate underbond consignments.

As is currently the case, cargo may be held by Customs in the port of discharge prior to underbond movement.

Those freight forwarders wishing to receive such underbond movements should first consult with the relevant
CTO or airline and obtain written agreement for the movement of consolidations direct to the forwarder's premise
from interstate. They should then forward a letter of application to the Border Licensing Officer in their region. The
application should also include a copy of the written agreement from the relevant discharge port CTO or airline
and an undertaking to abide by the conditions set out above.

Applicants should be aware that non-compliance with the above conditions may result in a review and possible
withdrawal of the approval to make such underbond movements.

Potential applicants need to be aware that ACA messaging specifications at the MAWB level differ from those
used at the house air waybill level. This means that although Customs will electronically facilitate these under-
bond moves for approved applicants they must, at their own expense, develop or acquire software capable of
processing messaging in the MAWB format.

Registered users of ACA seeking further technical information on underbond electronic messaging at the MAWB
level should contact the Assistant Director Cargo Automation, Chris Marsh, by phone on 02 6275 5908 or by
email at chris.marsh@customs.gov.au

Subsequent to the review by the TMRO, the TMRO recommended that the Minister direct the Chief Executive

The Minister has accepted the recommendation from the TMRO.

The Minister has directed Customs to report the result of the reinvestigation to her on or before 22 October 2000.

CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSAL NO.2 (2000) - GST ALCOHOL CHANGES

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (2000), which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 29 June 2000, introduced changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to implement the
Government's alcohol tax reforms under ""A New Tax System"". The alterations operate on and from 1 July 2000. Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 (2000) which contains complementary
amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 was tabled concurrently with this Proposal.

In general terms, the Proposal introduces:

a three tiered duty structure for beer which retains the current 1.15% duty free threshold. The new rates are:

- for beer not exceeding 3% alcohol, $41.67 per litre of alcohol;

- over 3% but not exceeding 3.5% alcohol, $35.38 per litre of alcohol; and

- for beer exceeding 3.5% alcohol, $30.46 per litre of alcohol;

an increase in the brandy rate of duty to $48.17, and the spirit rate of duty to $51.58 per litre of alcohol;

a new duty of $30.46 per litre of alcohol on mixed alcoholic beverages with an alcoholic strength exceeding 1.15% but not exceeding 10% alcohol.

- There is no 1.15% duty free threshold for these beverages but if they are less than 1.15% alcohol they are not
subject to the excise equivalent duty;

a new duty of $51.58 per litre of alcohol on mixed alcoholic beverages with an alcoholic strength exceeding 10%. Again, there is no 1.15% duty free threshold for these beverages;

separate tariff subheadings for goods that are subject to the Wine Equalisation Tax (WET). These new subheadings are:

CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSAL NO.5 (2000)

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 (2000) was tabled in the House of Representatives on 29 June 2000. It contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 which are
operative from 1 July 2000. These are:

Settlement of the Howe Leather Dispute

On 21 June 2000, it was announced by the Government that a settlement had been reached with the United States in relation to the Howe Leather dispute. Part of the settlement
involved Australia reducing the duty on 30 tariff subheadings from 5% to free. These subheadings are:

9503.80.00

Subheading 8520.32.90 has been amalgamated with 8520.32.10 to create new subheading 8520.32.00.

Alteration to Schedule 1 of the Customs Tariff Act

The United Nations reviews its list of designated least developed countries to ensure that the changing economic and development circumstances of individual countries are taken into
account. Following such a review, both Angola and Madagascar have been transferred from the list of DCS countries in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the list of DC countries in Part 3 of
Schedule 1.

The effect of the amendment will be to accord a tariff margin of 5%, where available, over the general rate of duty to imports from Angola and Madagascar.

The Proposal also recognised the change of name for Zaire to the Democratic Republic of Congo. This change is reflected in Part 3 of Schedule 1 of the Customs Tariff Act.

Item 54 in Part III of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act

The Administrative Arrangements for the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Import Credit Scheme provide transistional arrangements whereby import credits earned under the Scheme
may be used up until 30 December 2001. The current wording of item 54, however, only allows credits to be used until 30 June 2000.

Item 54 has therefore been amended by this Proposal to accurately reflect the administrative arrangements.

STATE OF ORIGIN FOR EXPORTS

Purpose

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice (ACN) is to seek assistance from exporters to improve the State of origin information reported for Australian exports. Additionally, it
provides information on how State of origin should be determined.

Background

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is undertaking a bilateral reconciliation study with New Zealand, using import and export statistics for 1998. An objective of such studies is to
identify and correct any data quality problems. This study has identified substantial misreporting of State of origin in Australian export statistics.

As an example, Australian exports (including re-exports) to New Zealand for the Australian Harmonised Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) item

84733001 were worth $A275 million, with $A64 million worth of these manufactured in Australia. New Zealand imports of these goods from Australia recorded only $A12 million of goods
manufactured in Australia. Most of the discrepancy is due to misreporting of State of origin on Australian export entries.

State of Origin

State of origin is defined as the Australian State in which the final stage of production or manufacture occurs.

The State of origin is NOT simply the State where:

the head office of the exporter is located;

the ECN or entry is lodged:

the goods were loaded on the international carrier.

The following examples help clarify the treatments required:

Re-exports are goods which are imported and re-exported in the same condition as they arrive, or after undergoing repair or minor alteration and should be shown as 'F', indicating
goods of foreign origin.

Operations which leave the goods essentially unchanged (for example, repair, blending, packaging, bottling, cleaning, sorting, husking and shelling) should not be considered as
stages of production or manufacture.

Goods assembled from parts previously imported from overseas, where the end product does not resemble the component parts, should be attributed to the State in which the
assembly took place.

Minerals in ore and concentrate form (for example, iron ore and concentrate) should be attributed to the State in which they were mined. Metals (for example, iron and steel ingots)
should be attributed to the State in which they were processed.

INDEXATION OF CERTAIN EXCISE AND CUSTOMS TARIFF

DUTY RATES AND THE DIESEL FUEL REBATE

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the
Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer (except
""home brew""), tobacco and certain petroleum products increased on 1 August 2000.
Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment to this Notice
set out the new rates.

Rates of duty are indexed by multiplying the current rates by a factor. This factor is
calculated by dividing the most recent index number by the previous highest December or
June index number. Accordingly, the June 2000 index number (126.2) has been divided by the
December 1999 number (124.1) to establish the indexation factor of 1.017. As this factor
is more than 1, current rates of excise and customs duty were increased by this amount.

Where rates of excise and customs duty are indexed, complementary increases in the
rates of diesel fuel rebate are also made. These increases are effected by declarations
under subsections 78A(5A) and 78A(5AAC) of the Excise Act 1901 and subsections 164(5A) and
164(5AAC) of the Customs Act 1901. The new declared rates of diesel fuel rebate were
effective from 1 August 2000. These rates are listed in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the
Attachment to this Notice.

Actual rates of rebate payable can differ from these declared rates because of the
averaging provisions of the rebate legislation. The rate applicable to a particular claim
is shown on the payment advice forwarded to claimants.

VALUATION OF CARRIER MEDIA BEARING SOFTWARE

On 1 July 2000, Customs published information on the Tax Reform website about the valuation procedures
relating to software contained on imported disks, tapes, CD-ROMS and other similar items (generally referred to
as ""carrier media""). It is apparent that some importers/brokers have not been including the value of the software
in the customs value of these goods when entering them for home consumption. This practice, which appears to
have developed in 1991 when carrier media became free of customs duty but were still subject to sales tax, is
incorrect.

Customs notes that some confusion may also have arisen following the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) Customs Valuation Committee decision on the Valuation of Carrier Media Bearing Software for Data
Processing Equipment in September 1984. This decision noted the application of normal valuation rules which
provide for the customs value to include payments for both the software and the carrier media. However, in
recognition of the fact that some countries wanted to continue their previous (pre-Customs Valuation Agreement)
practice of excluding the value of software from the customs value, the decision also allowed Members to adopt
that approach.

Australia notified the Customs Valuation Committee that normal valuation rules would apply to carrier media
bearing software, but that the software was free of customs duty.

Importers and brokers are reminded that, notwithstanding the various changes to customs duty and sales tax in
relation to software and carrier media, the normal principles of customs valuation contained in Division 2 of Part
VIII of the Customs Act apply to carrier media bearing software and remain unchanged. The customs value of
carrier media bearing software should therefore include the payments made, or to be made, for both the software
and the carrier media.

Any questions in relation to this ACN should be directed to Manager, Valuation and Origin on (02) 6275 6556.

____________________________________________________________________ 

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION 
TRADE MARKS ACT 1995 

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the 
Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have 
applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s.  Unless 
revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force for a period of two years from the 
commencement date shown for the particular trade mark. 

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed 
in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations.  Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the 
particular trade mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question.  
However, where certain objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade 
marks covering a diversity of goods, it has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the 
intricacies of some of those Notices.  The Schedule clearly indicates where that applies with an 
asterisk.  In any case prospective importers should seek further advice regarding the coverage of the 
Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final paragraph below). 

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a 
sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are 
liable to be seized by Customs, unless it can be established that: 

− 

− 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); 
or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark 
may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the 
mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered 
owner of the trade mark. 

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under 
the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a 
suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the 
meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an 
infringement of"" a trade mark.   

The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers 
who may wish to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Air Cargo Automation - Changes To The Transmission Of

Underbond, Transhipment, And Quarantine Hold Status

On 16 February 1999, the Australian Customs Service (Customs), with the concurrence of the Australian
Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS), issued Australian Customs Notice 99/17. That Notice introduced revised
clearance procedures for specified categories of air cargo reported at the master air waybill (MAWB) level as from
1 March 1999.

Customs has now re-programmed the transmission of certain statuses at the MAWB level so that Cargo Terminal
Operators (CTOs) should be in possession of these statuses upon cargo discharge.

Specifically, the following statuses:

A120 (interstate underbond movement)
A125 (interstate underbond movement, subject to quarantine)
P300 (transhipment)
P305 (transhipment, subject to quarantine)and
P310 (transhipment, quarantine clear)

are now transmitted upon application of the status by Customs. That is, transmission of these statuses is
contingent upon the time of report rather than flight transmission. Where the expected status has not been
returned by Customs prior to flight transmission the CTO should not make any assumptions but await full Air
Cargo Automation (ACA) flight transmission.

Early transmission is also extended to status Q600 (AQIS hold cargo hold documents).

A condition of the early transmission of these statuses is that those cargo reporters responsible for the report of
the MAWBs do not make such reports prior to the departure of the aircraft from the last overseas airport. This
condition is fundamental to the continued provision of this new procedure and compliance with the condition will
be monitored by Customs.

With the introduction of these new procedures CTOs are now advised that the provisions of ACN 99/17 relating to
the anticipation of statuses are hereby withdrawn. CTOs are to continue to provide through ACA a complete
report for all cargo at the port of discharge (including ""Air-side transfers"").

These transmission changes were effective from 22 July 2000.

SECTION 269TD OF THE CUSTOMS ACT 1901 PRELIMINARY AFFIRMATIVE DETERMINATION AND
IMPOSITION OF SECURITIES CERTAIN WOUND/SKIN CLOSURE STRIPS FROM GERMANY

On 13 September 2000 the Australian Customs Service (Customs) commenced an investigation into the alleged dumping of certain wound/skin closure strips exported to Australia from 
Germany by Beiersdorf AG. Customs initiated the investigation following receipt of an application by Surgi Supplies International Pty Ltd, the sole Australian manufacturer of wound/skin 
closure strips. The goods are classified to subheading 3005.10.00 statistical code 23 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The rate of duty is 5%.

In accordance with s.269TD of the Act, I am satisfied that there appears to be sufficient grounds for the publication of a dumping duty notice.

In order to prevent material injury occurring to the Australian industry while the investigation continues, securities under s. 42 of the Customs Act will be required in respect of any interim 
dumping duty that may become payable in respect of the goods exported from Germany.

Particulars of the dumping margin established and the method used to establish that margin are set out below:

Country of export

Exporter

Dumping margin

Method used to establish margin

Germany

Beiersdorf AG

580%

A comparison of the weighted average normal value to weighted average export price for all models

Due to the size of the dumping margin, Customs considers it likely that any interim dumping duty that may become payable would be calculated by reference to the non-injurious price of
the goods exported to Australia. Customs has, therefore, based the amount of securities payable on the difference between an estimate of weighted average non-injurious price and the
weighted average export price.

The actual amount of the security is not published, as it is confidential.

In reaching this determination, Customs found that:

imports of wound closure strips from Germany are dumped;

there appears to be a threat of material injury to the Australian industry; and

there appears to be a causal link between the dumping of wound closure strips from Germany and the threat of material injury to the Australian industry.

The details of the reasons for this determination are set out in a report which has been placed on the public file. The report may also be obtained by contacting the case officer, Mr Michael
Kenna, on telephone number (02) 6275 6544, or Mr Phil Hilyard on telephone number (02) 6275 6057.

A statement of essential facts will be placed on the public record by 1 January 2001. The statement will contain material findings of fact on which Customs proposes to base its final

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS

ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act
1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to them, or in relation to
them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force
for a period of two years from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in
Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade
mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain
objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it
has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice
regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final
paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is
substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to be seized by
Customs, unless it can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or

- the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not,
amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions
of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially
identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.

The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish
to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each

NEW ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE GRANT AND RENEWAL OF

CUSTOMS BROKERS' LICENCES

Legislation has been passed to increase the duration of customs brokers' licences from one to three years: see
section 183CH of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act). All current customs brokers' licences and corporate customs
brokers' licences expire on 31 December 2000. Licences that are to come into effect after 31 December 2000
(whether by reason of grant or renewal of the licence) remain in force until 30 June 2003. Section 183CJ(1) of the
Act provides for the renewal of licences.

As in previous years, ""Application for Renewal of Customs Brokers' Licence"" forms will be distributed to all
customs brokers and corporate customs brokers who hold current licences. Current customs brokers wishing to
renew should apply in writing by completing the ""Application for Renewal of Customs Brokers' Licence"" form and
forwarding it to the Chief Executive Officer (the CEO) or relevant Regional Director before COB 31 December
2000. Payment of the renewal fee should accompany the application.

Current licences that are not renewed by COB 31 December 2000 will expire on that date and may not be used.
Individuals or corporate bodies that have not renewed their licences by that date, but who still wish to be licensed,
will be required to make a new application to the CEO. Following receipt of the new application, the CEO,
pursuant to section 183CB of the Act, will forward the application to the National Customs Brokers' Licensing
Advisory Committee (NCBLAC) which will be required to report to the CEO as to whether the applicant should be
licensed.

Fees for the grant or the renewal of a customs brokers' licence must be paid by the day on which the renewal of
the licence, or the new licence, is to come into force, (Customs Regulation 160). The new fee payable (Customs
Regulation 158) in respect of a licence that comes into force after 31 December 2000 (whether by reason of grant
or renewal of the licence) is:

1. where the customs broker is a natural person who does not intend to act, at any time when the licence is in

force in his/her own right - $120; or

2. in any other case - $1200.

In order to facilitate processing of the ""Application for Renewal of Customs Brokers' Licence"" forms by Customs,
licence holders intending to renew their licences are requested to complete their renewal form and lodge it,
together with the respective fee, well before 31 December 2000.

Corporate customs brokers are also requested to include with their application form:

1. a list of all nominees currently employed by their agency; and
2. a list of all persons currently having authority to direct the nominees of the agency for the purposes of the Act.

In relation to this request corporate customs brokers are reminded that, in accordance with section 183CG(3) of
the Act, and amongst other requirements, it is a condition of the licence that the CEO should be advised within
thirty (30) days of a change of nominees, of persons authorised to direct nominees, or of the composition of a
partnership.

Distribution of Renewal Notices

The application for renewal of licence will be forwarded directly to the last known address of the licensee. The
licensee will then be responsible for presenting the completed renewal application and the payment of the licence
fee to the CEO or a Regional Director.

Payment of Licence Fee

The licence fees can be paid by either:

1. presenting the completed renewal form and payment to the cashier at your local Customs House.
2. mailing the completed renewal form and a cheque payable to the ""Australian Customs Service"" to:

ELECTRONIC LODGEMENT OF REFUNDS (ELOR)

REGULATIONS AND OTHER TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS.

ELOR

In ACN 2000/20 dated 25 May 2000 it was announced, amongst other things, that certain consequential and
preparatory refund regulation amendments had been made resulting from the enactment of the ELOR legislation.
(Schedule 1 to the Customs Legislation Amendment Act (No.2 ) 1999). Further amendments to the refund
regulations (as contained in the Customs Regulations 1926 (""the Regulations"")) have now been introduced to
detail the procedures involved in applying for refunds, rebates and remissions of duty through the electronic
processing system, COMPILE. With effect from 20 December 2000, the amendments will bring procedures for
applying for refunds into line with the existing electronic lodgement procedures for import entries, embracing the
self assessment risk management basis and the accompanying penalty provisions of 243T, U and V of
the Customs Act 1901, applying to import entries. The amendments also provide for contingency arrangements to
apply if the period within which an application for a refund may be made, expires while the COMPILE system is
unavailable. A synopsis of these amendments is set out in the Attachment to this notice. A series of information
seminars were conducted in May/June 1999 to explain the ELOR COMPILE enhancements, announced in ACNs
1999/12 and 1999/37.

Under the regulations, a person is able to apply for a refund of duty, in relation to a Tariff Concession Order
(TCO), within 12 months of certain events occurring.

The regulations have been amended to allow for two additional events:

The first event is the gazettal of a decision by the CEO to revoke a TCO and to make a new TCO in respect of
the same goods. It is referred to in new paragraph 128A(4B)(ca) of the Regulations.

The decision by the CEO is made under
subsection 269SD(2) of the Customs Act 1901 (the
Act) and is gazetted under section 269SE of the
Act.

The second event is a decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in relation to a decision made by
the CEO to make a TCO until local production starts or from when local production ceases. It is referred to in
(amended) paragraph 128A(4B)(d) of the Regulations.

The decision by the CEO is made under
subsection 269SA(1) or (2) of the Act. Under
paragraph 273GA(1)(p) of the Act, an
application may be made to the AAT for review
of that decision.

ATTACHMENT TO ACN NO 2000/73

Subregulation 128(1) of the Regulations referring to documentary applications has been restructured and a new
subregulation 128(1A) of the Regulations has been introduced dealing with applications by computer.

Subregulations 128(1) and 128(1A) detail the information required when lodging an application by document or by
computer, the manner in which the application must be made and the method of lodgement of the application.
The application, if made by computer, must be made by a registered COMPILE user and be signed by
transmitting with the application the registered COMPILE user's PIN number.

The terms ""registered COMPILE user"", and ""COMPILE computer system"" and ""PIN number"" are defined in
subsection 4 (1) of the Act.

Subregulation 128(3) has been amended by inserting a reference to paragraph 128(1A)(b) to ensure that only
one circumstance may be stated to apply to particular goods mentioned in a line of a computer application, as is
the case currently for documentary applications.

New subregulation 128(3A) clarifies that a refund application is to be treated as having been made to the CEO of
Customs.

Three new regulations (128AAA, 128AAB and 128AAC) have been introduced to provide for the procedures for
dealing with applications for rebates, refunds or remissions, the communication of the applications and the
contingency arrangements to apply if the computer system is down.

Subregulation 128AAA(2) provides that Customs must verify particulars in an application, or be satisfied of any
matter relevant to approval of the refund, rebate or remission.

Subregulation 128AAA(3) provides that if required to do so by a Collector, the applicant must deliver to the
Collector relevant documents that are within the applicant's possession or under his or her control. If required to
do so, the applicant must also give the Collector relevant information that is within the applicant's

knowledge or that he or she could reasonably obtain.

Subregulations 128AAA(4) and (5) specifies the procedures for requesting further information.

Regulation 128AAB specifies that an application for a refund, rebate or remission will be taken to have been
communicated to Customs when an electronic message is transmitted by Customs, using the COMPILE
computer system, to the registered COMPILE user whose PIN number was transmitted in relation to the
application. That electronic message will either state that the application has been accepted and the refund,
rebate or remission has been approved or the application has been received but further information is required.

Regulation 128AAC provides for contingency arrangements to deal with circumstances where COMPILE is down.
The contingency arrangements will only apply and cease to apply if and when the CEO of Customs declares in
writing that they do apply and cease to apply.

Subregulation 128A(5) has been amended to extend the time for making an application to the end of the day after
the day on which the contingency arrangements are declared to cease if contingency arrangements apply. This
will allow for a situation where the time for making a refund application expires while the contingency
arrangements are in force.

Paragraph 128AA(3)(a) has been amended by inserting a reference to 128(1A)(b) to ensure that if a person is
entitled to apply for a refund by document without paying an application fee, the person is entitled to make that
application by computer.

As part of the Measures for a Better Environment, announced by the Prime Minister on 28 May 1999, a decision
was made to introduce a product stewardship scheme for waste oil. The scheme will use revenue, collected by a
levy on certain oil products, to fund benefit payments to oil recyclers who are recycling oil in environmentally
appropriate ways. The levy, commencing on 1 January 2001, will be collected as a 5 cent per litre excise on
locally produced goods or a customs duty on imported products.

3403.19.00
3403.91.00
3403.99.00
3811.21.00
3819.00.00 (see Note)

The levy will also apply to petroleum based oils and greases that are currently classified within subheading
2710.00.90.

Note: Some goods classified to subheading 3819.00.00 are subject
to a Tariff Concession Order. Item 50 in Schedule 4 has therefore
been amended and a new Item 50B has been created to provide
for the collection of the levy on these goods.

Revised tariff working papers to reflect these changes will be distributed in the week commencing 18 December
2000.

Options for payment of the levy

Direct for home consumption

Importers importing directly for home consumption will pay the levy on Nature 10 entries.

Customs Warehouse

Importers may wish to apply for a warehouse license to defer payment of the levy. Warehouse licensees are
required to pay an annual fee for their licence. These fees are set annually and are $7000 for a new licence and
$4000 for a license renewal in financial year 2000-01. Alternatively, oil importers may use existing general
warehouses licensed by Customs that provide, for a fee, storage for imported goods on which levy has not been
paid.

Please also see information on excise manufacture and exempt blends.

Excise manufacture

Products imported for use in excise manufacture can be imported using Item 44 in Part III of Schedule 4 of the
Customs Tariff Act. Goods entered under that item do not attract the levy, instead it is collected as an excise on
the finished product under the provisions of the Excise Act.

There are conditions imposed on the movement and storage of goods entered using

Item 44. Contact the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for more information (see below).

TRADE MARKS ACT 1995

This Customs notice is to provide advice to owners and authorised users of trade marks registered in Australia, and to importers who may import goods to which trade marks have been
applied.

Government policy on imported goods to which a trade mark has been applied by an overseas trade mark owner has been clarified in consultation with IP Australia. Importers and trade
mark owners should be aware that where the trade mark has not been applied by, or with the consent of, the Australian trade mark owner, and a Notice of Objection is in place, these
goods may be seized under section 133 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (the Act).

The operation of the Customs seizure provisions of the Act was originally published in ACN 96/01. To assist trade mark owners and importers information contained in ACN 96/01 has
been updated in this notice.

This notice gives a brief outline of the requirements for seeking action by the Australian Customs Service (Customs) under the Act. Because of the complex nature of the Act and the
obligations it places on the Objector, it is recommended that persons considering the lodgement of a Notice of Objection discuss the matter with their legal advisers before proceeding
with the Notice.

1. Outline

Section 132 of the Act provides that the registered owner, or in certain circumstances an authorised user, of a trade mark, may object to the importation of goods bearing a trade mark
substantially identical with or deceptively similar to that trade mark. Section 133 empowers Customs to seize such goods pending resolution of the matter, as detailed in this notice.

3. Seizure Provisions

Section 133 provides that where:

goods manufactured outside Australia have been imported into Australia and are subject to the control of Customs;
a Notice in writing objecting to the importation of goods infringing a trade mark registered in respect of the goods imported has been given to Customs; and
the goods, in the opinion of Customs, have applied to them a trade mark that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to the notified trade mark;

Customs is required to seize imported goods infringing a notified trade mark unless:

the CEO is satisfied that there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the importation of the goods constitutes an infringement of the notified trade mark; or
the Objector has not provided sufficient security to reimburse the Commonwealth in respect of expenses that may be incurred by the Commonwealth in relation to the seizure of the
goods.

The scheme only empowers Customs to take seizure action where there is a Notice of Objection in place. It should be noted that where the trade mark has not been applied by, or with
the consent of, the Australian owner of the trade mark and the goods are imported into Australia, this may represent an infringement. This situation could arise where the owners of the
Australian trade mark and the overseas trade mark are not the same.

The seizure powers are directly conferred on Customs under the Act. The authority to seize is separate from, and should not be confused with, the more general seizure provisions
contained in the Customs Act 1901.

The Act does not provide for seizure of goods that are imported for the personal use of the importer and are not intended to be dealt with or provided in the course of trade.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS FOR SPARTECA (TCF PROVISIONS)

SCHEME

On 28 February 2001, Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2001) was tabled in Parliament. Australian Customs Notice
No. 2001/16 refers.

This proposal included the creation of a new item 68 in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff).
Item 68 allows certain goods to be entered duty free from March 2001 under the SPARTECA (TCF Provisions)
Scheme (""the Scheme""). This item covers:

""Goods that are Qualifying Goods, as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the SPARTECA (TCF Provisions)
Scheme, entered for home consumption on or before 31 December 2004"".

Terms and Conditions of the Scheme

The Scheme enables certain goods that are not entitled to duty free entry under SPARTECA to enter duty free
under item 68, providing specific conditions are met. Detailed Terms and Conditions of the Scheme are available
from the Department of Industry, Science and Resources at the address below.

Registration

Only goods from Forum Island Country (FIC) manufacturers registered under the Scheme can be entered under
item 68. FIC manufacturers wishing to register for the Scheme should address their applications to:

SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme
TCF Policy Unit
Department of Industry, Science and Resources
GPO Box 9839
CANBERRA, ACT 2601
AUSTRALIA

Entry requirements

SPARTECA

Goods meeting the SPARTECA provisions for duty free entry will continue to be entered in the same way as they
have been previously. The requirement for importers to obtain appropriate declarations from FIC manufacturers
will remain. There will be no change to the format of the standard SPARTECA declaration, a copy of which is
at Attachment 1.

SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme

Before entering goods under item 68, importers must obtain declarations from relevant FIC manufacturers stating
that the goods are ""Qualifying Goods"" under the Scheme, in accordance with the Customs Declaration Form for
the Scheme at Attachment 2.

Importers must also ensure that the goods are classified within a heading or subheading of Schedule 3 to the
Tariff specified in Appendix A to the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme, and meet any other requirements of
that Appendix.

Duty free entry of goods that qualify under the Scheme can be obtained by quoting the following information on
an entry for home consumption, in addition to any other entry data required:

the treatment code for item 68 (currently 468);
preference indicator ""X""; and
the reference numbers (know as ELAC IDs) that are cited in the manufacturer's declaration in relation to those
goods. Note: ELAC ID(s) must be input on the ""Goods Description"" line of the entry.

ARRANGEMENTS REGARDING THE REVOCATION OF

PASSENGER MOTOR VEHICLE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT BY-

LAWS (ITEM 41B) AND TERMINATION OF END USE

SECURITY

As outlined in Australian Customs Notice 2000/38, the previous arrangements for the importation of original
equipment (OE) components duty free for use in the manufacture of passenger motor vehicles (PMVs) ceased at
midnight 31 December 2000.

This notice outlines, for security holders, the termination arrangements associated with the wind-up of the export
facilitation scheme (EFS) and has been prepared in consultation with the Department of Industry, Science and
Resources (ISR).

With effect from 1 January 2001 by-laws, made under Item 41B of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the
Tariff), which allowed the duty free importation of original equipment (OE) components designated for use in the
manufacture of passenger motor vehicles (PMVs), have been revoked. These by-laws required an end use
security that was conditional on the OE components being used in the local manufacture of PMVs. Please note
that assistance under the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme (ACIS) for OE components
imported after 1 January 2001 will not be affected by the following arrangements.

Additionally, importers may be able to offset duty liabilities at the time of importation by the use of EFS credits
through Item 41A until 31 December 2001 and ACIS credits through Item 41E from 1 January 2001. Transitional
arrangements have been introduced to allow participants to reduce their Item 41B stock and introduce duty paid
stock during the first quarter of 2001. Under these arrangements, imports that have been entered under Item 41B
prior to 1 January 2001 can continue to be used as OE in the production of certain PMVs until 31 March 2001.

Security holders will however be responsible for providing details of usage of Item 41B goods after 1 January
2001 Security holders will need to provide a report to Customs by 30 April 2001, detailing the amount (including a
nil report when appropriate) of Item 41B stock on hand as at 31 March 2001.

This report should be submitted, in the format normally used to acquit security liabilities and volunteering of
damages, to the Inspector Securities, Import/Export Management in the respective State or Territory.

Contact details are contained in the Attachment to this notice.

Customs, in conjunction with ISR, have monitored imports in the lead-up to the repeal of Item 41B and its by-laws
and reserves the right to undertake or require comprehensive audits of particular companies and or component
producers as part of its ongoing compliance program.

Any inquiries concerning the arrangements in this notice should be directed to the Customs Manager Automotive
and Transport, on telephone(03) 9244 8369, or to one of the contact officers listed on the Attachment.

Indexation of Certain Excise and Customs Tariff Duty Rates and the Diesel Fuel Rebate

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer (except ""home brew""),
tobacco, certain petroleum products including petroleum based oils and greases and their synthetic equivalents increased on 1 February 2001. The new rates are set out in Tables 1 and
2 of the Attachment to this Notice.

The rates of duty and excise listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment are indexed by multiplying the current rates by a factor. This factor is calculated by dividing the most recent index
number by the previous highest December or June index number. Accordingly, the December 2000 index number (131.3) has been divided by the June 2000 number (126.2) to establish
an indexation factor of 1.040. As this factor is more than one, current rates of excise and customs duty were increased by this factor.

Where rates of excise and customs duty are indexed, complementary increases in the rates of diesel fuel rebate are also made. These increases are effected by declarations under
subsections 78A(5A) and 78A(5AAC) of the Excise Act 1901 and subsections 164(5A) and 164(5AAC) of the Customs Act 1901. The new declared rates of diesel fuel rebate were
effective from 1 February 2001. These rates are listed in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Attachment to this Notice.

Actual rates of rebate payable can differ from the declared rates because of the averaging provisions of the rebate legislation. The rate applicable to a particular claim is shown on the
payment advice forwarded to claimants.

Attachment A

 SUMMARY

This report presents the results of the Australian Customs Service (Customs) investigation into the alleged
dumping of imports of tinplate from Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

BHP Packaging Products (BHPP) lodged an application with Customs requesting that anti-dumping measures be
imposed on tinplate exported to Australia from Taiwan and the United Kingdom. BHPP claimed that exports from
these countries were dumped and causing material injury to the Australian industry.

In July 2000, BHPP formally withdrew that part of its application relating to exports of tinplate exported from the
United Kingdom.

The Australian market for tinplate is supplied by local production and by imports from a number of countries,
including Taiwan and the United Kingdom. The sole producer of tinplate in Australia is BHPP, which produces
tinplate at its Port Kembla mill, NSW. Tinplate is used to produce a wide variety of consumer and industrial
containers, such as food cans, paint cans and aerosol cans.

Customs estimated that the value of the Australian market for tinplate was around $260 million in 1999.

Customs has found that the tinplate exported from Taiwan was exported to Australia at a weighted average
dumping margin of 19 per cent over the period of investigation and that this has caused material injury to the
Australian industry. Customs found that BHPP had suffered material injury in various forms. In particular, BHPP
lost a significant part of its market share to dumped imports from Taiwan in the first half of 2000. This also
resulted in a substantial decline in BHPP's profit in that period.

Accordingly, Customs recommends that dumping duties be imposed on future exports of tinplate from Taiwan to
Australia.

The exporter in Taiwan has offered a price undertaking as an alternative to the imposition of dumping duties.
However, Customs does not support a price undertaking in this case because of problems associated with
monitoring the effectiveness of the measures and because of the potential for circumvention of the measures.

Guidelines for Entry of Partially Dismantled Vehicles

Following changes made last year to the Motor Vehicle Standards Regulations 1989, approval permits for
complete vehicles imported for dismantling are no longer issued.

As a result, there is a need to clarify the point at which a disassembled vehicle ceases, for Customs Tariff
purposes, to be considered as a complete vehicle but rather is considered as parts for a vehicle. Parts do not
require an import approval from the Department of Transport and Regional Services.

The following tariff precedents have been created to clarify this issue and to provide uniformity of information to
importers and brokers to assist them in complying with entry of goods under the Customs Act 1901 (Customs
Act):

Precedent No. 15439700 relates to parts of trucks for the purposes of subheading 8708.99.99. For these
goods to be considered as parts they must be imported with at least the engine and gearbox removed and
these components must not be shipped on the same vessel;

Precedent No. 15439800 relates to bodies for passenger motor vehicles for the purposes of subheading
8707.10.91. For these goods to be considered as parts they must be imported with at least the engine,
transmission and all wheels and axles removed and these components must not be shipped on the same
vessel; and

Precedent No. 15439900 relates to parts of motorcycles for the purposes of subheading 8714.19.90. For these
goods to be considered as parts of motorcycles they must be imported with at least the front forks, steering
and wheels removed and these components must not be shipped on the same vessel.

Customs will monitor the importation of these goods periodically. Importers should note that where breaches are
detected and the goods have been imported outside the scope of these decisions without a valid permit,
administrative penalties under section 243T of the Customs Act may apply.

Amendment to the Approved Statement for export entries concerning Australian Business

Numbers

The purpose of this Notice is to advise you of the need to report Australian Business Numbers (ABNs) on all export entries lodged with Customs for the purposes of
granting an authority to deal.

It is intended that the ABN will become a unique and universal identification number for businesses to simplify the interaction between Government and industry. Consistent
with this objective, it is the intention of Customs to ensure that where an ABN exists for an owner that the ABN is quoted on all export entries.

Section 114 (3) (d) of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) states that information submitted to Customs in relation to export entries must ""communicate such information as is
set out in an approved statement"". Item 7 of the approved statement has recently been amended to clarify the requirement to report ABNs. Specifically the statement now
makes it clear that the inclusion of the ABN is mandatory for those owners of goods who have one.

Item 7 of the statement now reads:

Owner's
ABN or
Name

The Australian Business Number (ABN) of the common law owner of the goods (if the common law
owner has an ABN) or the name of the common law owner of the goods (if the common law owner does
not have an ABN). If an ABN is quoted, it is not necessary to quote the name of the common law owner.
Where the ABN is quoted the ABN must be prefixed with ""ABN="".

As you probably know the Australian Taxation Office will be carrying out verification checks of GST-free amounts disclosed on Business Activity Statements and will have
regard to information gathered from Customs export reporting systems to establish proof of exportation. If an exporter's ABN is reported on their export entry, it will assist
them in substantiating the amount of GST-free supplies in the event of a verification check of their business activities.

The guidelines will also replace those sections of ACN No.98/27 which deal with items 57 and 60.

ACN No. 98/27 will continue to operate as it deals with items 43, 47 and 52. These items are administered by
Customs.

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION TRADE MARKS

ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the Trade Marks Act
1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have applied to them, or in relation to
them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s. Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force
for a period of two years from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed in
Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations. Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the particular trade
mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question. However, where certain
objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade marks covering a diversity of goods, it
has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the intricacies of some of those Notices. The Schedule clearly
indicates where that applies with an asterisk. In any case prospective importers should seek further advice
regarding the coverage of the Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final
paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign that is
substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to be seized by
Customs, unless it can be established that:

- the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or

- the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not,
amount to an infringement. For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark. However, where the
trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trademark and the goods are imported
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions
of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially
identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.

The trade mark owner's contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers who may wish
to initiate negotiations regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each
State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of
Objection, or Customs' role in regard to those Notices, should contact the Commerce Prohibitions and
Restrictions Group in the Australian Customs Service Office in their nearest capital city. - see Attachment A

Amendments to the Australian Customs tariff and the

Australian harmonized export commodity classification

The International Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HCDCS), forms the basis of
Australia's commodity classifications for traded goods. These classifications are contained in the Australian
Customs Tariff (the Tariff) for imports and the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC)
for exports.

The World Customs Organization, which sponsors the HCDCS, has requested that signatory parties, including
Australia, implement approximately 300 amendments to the six digit HCDCS classification. This will result in
changes to Australia's more detailed import and export classifications which are extensions of the HCDCS. The
Tariff and the AHECC will be amended to incorporate the necessary changes from 1 January 2002. This will result
in approximately 800 changes to the Tariff, affecting 12% of commodity classifications.

A similar exercise was conducted in 1996, at the time of the introduction of the Customs Tariff Act 1995. As
previously, the aim of this exercise will be to maintain existing duty rates. In many cases however, this will require
the creation of new domestic tariff splits.

The necessary legislation is now being prepared and it is expected that a Proposal will be tabled in the House of
Representatives in August 2001.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) will issue proposed changes to the eight digit export statistical codes in
March and will then consult with interested parties in respect of the proposals. A similar process will be followed
for the ten digit import statistical codes, once Customs has determined the eight digit tariff codes.

The ABS will make detailed information concerning these changes available on its website (www.abs.gov.au -
select Themes \ International Trade \ Classifications \ Harmonized System Review 2002).

Users who wish to directly receive information or make submissions regarding these changes to the import and
export statistical codes, should contact Marion Hall at the ABS on (02) 6252 6379 or email hsreview@abs.gov.au.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2001)

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2001) was tabled in the House of Representatives on 28 February 2001. It
contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff Act). Most of the
amendments contained in the Proposal have been in operation since 1 January 2001, following publication of
Customs Tariff Notice No. 1 (2000) in Special Gazette S644 on 20 December 2000.

The amendments to Schedule 4 items 41A, 41B and 41C and the creation of new items 41F and 41G relate to
the cessation of the ""Administrative Arrangements to the Year 2000 for the Automotive Industry"" on 31 December
2000 and the commencement of the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme on 1 January 2001.

The amendment to the Table in Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act is a technical amendment to ensure that the
correct tariff subheading/excise item pairs are included in the Table following the commencement of the Product
Stewardship for Waste Oil legislation on 1 January 2001.

The final amendment is the creation of item 68 in Schedule 4 to allow certain textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF)
to be imported duty free under the SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme. This item will commence on 1 March
2001, and Australian Customs Notice 2001/01 is being issued in relation to this item.

Customs Tariff reprint pages issued in connection with these changes are:

Regulation changes temporary imports and drawback\refund

The purpose of this Customs Notice is to advise of changes to the Customs Regulations 1926 (""the Regulations"")
that will take effect on 1 March 2001. These changes are contained in the Customs Amendment Regulations (No.
1) 2001 (SR No. 30) (""the Amending Regulations""). These changes amend the Regulations to:

remove wedding presents and traveller's samples from the classes of goods that can be imported temporarily
without the payment of duty;
insert a new class of goods that can be imported temporarily without the payment of duty, being specialised
equipment or tools to be used in exploration, production, manufacture, repair or modification; that are also
specified in the categories of goods contained in those Customs Conventions on Temporary Admission
acceded to by Australia, and
remove the restriction from the drawback provisions which prohibits a drawback of duty being paid on
relanded goods.

The changes are the result of the Tradex review.

The Amending Regulations also:

amend the prescribed purposes for which goods may be temporarily imported;
replace a prescribed form with an approved form;
prescribe new conditions that must be complied with before temporarily imported goods can be exported; and
return the manual refund application fee to $65.00.

Temporary Import Regulation Changes

Subsection 162(1) of the Customs Act 1901 provides that where a person imports goods included in a prescribed
class, or goods intended for a prescribed purpose and the person intends to export those goods, the Collector
may grant the importer permission to take delivery upon giving a security or an undertaking for the payment of
duty, goods and services tax and/or luxury car tax otherwise payable on those goods.

Regulation 124 provides that for the purposes of section 162 the prescribed classes of goods include traveller's
samples and wedding presents. The amended regulations remove those two classes of goods and insert a new
class of goods, being certain types of specialised equipment or tools.

Subregulation 124(1)(c) provides that for the purposes of section 162, the prescribed purposes are:

assembly or other industrial purposes approved by the Collector; and
testing and evaluation.

The amended Regulations remove the first purpose and make it clear that the second purpose applies where the
testing and evaluation is in respect of the imported goods themselves, and not the testing and evaluation of other
goods.

The major effect on current users of the temporary import provisions is that Australian individuals and companies
wishing to import equipment for purposes such as testing, commissioning, maintenance or repair of machinery,
plant, means of transport (including aircraft), survey of ships and similar purposes will now be able to use
paragraph 124(1)(b) of the Regulations, as the provision extends eligibility under the Customs Convention on the
Temporary Importation of Professional Equipment (Brussels, 1961) to Australians.

Previously, goods in the above categories could only be temporarily imported by foreign individuals or company
representatives visiting Australia for a specified task.

An application for the permission of the Collector under section 162 of the Act was previously required to be
made in accordance with Form 46 in the Regulations. The Regulations omit the prescribed Form 46 and now
require the application to be made in an approved form.

The current application form is available on the Customs Internet site at
http://www.customs.gov.au/ecom/prodn/homepage/bizlink/imports/imptmp/index.htm#top.

CUSTOMS ACT 1901 - PART XVB CERTAIN GALVANISED

STEEL PIPE EXPORTED FROM THAILAND BY COTCO-SV

EASTERN STEEL PIPE LTD FINDING

The Australian Customs Service (Customs) has completed its accelerated review of the dumping duty notice
applying to certain galvanised steel pipe exported to Australia from Thailand by COTCO-SV Eastern Steel Pipe
Ltd (COTCO).

In Trade Measures Report No.37 Customs, having regard to the available evidence, found:

export prices for COTCO are different to those previously ascertained;
normal values for COTCO are different to those previously ascertained;
the goods under review have been dumped; and
no evidence to suggest that the NIP for COTCO is different to that previously ascertained.

The Minister accepts the recommendations from Customs and pursuant to subsection 269ZG(3)(b) of
the Customs Act 1901 declares that, with effect from the date the application was lodged, the Customs Act
1901 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 have effect as if the original dumping duty notice had
applied to the applicant but the Minister had fixed different export prices and normal values relevant to the
determination of duty payable by the applicant.

The result of the declaration is that dumping duties continue to apply to certain galvanised steel pipe exported
from Thailand by COTCO, but at a higher rate of dumping duty. Customs will not publicise export prices and
normal values as they may reveal confidential details of the company concerned.

Report No. 37 contains the reasons for Customs recommendations and is available on request from Trade
Measures Office Management, Australian Customs Service, Canberra, telephone (02) 6275 6057

Enquiries about this notice may be directed to Justin Wickes, Trade Measures Branch, Operations 5 on 02 6275

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (2001)

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (2001) was tabled in the House of Representatives on 1 March 2001. The Proposal
contained a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff Act) to give effect to
recent decisions by the Government in relation to customs and excise duties on certain fuels.

The customs duty on leaded and unleaded petrol and diesel fuel was reduced by 1.5 cents per litre, effective from
2 March 2001. A proportional reduction of customs duty, also effective from 2 March 2001, was made for burner
fuels and aviation fuels.

Equivalent changes have also been made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921.

____________________________________________________________________

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION
TRADE MARKS ACT 1995

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the
Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have
applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s.  Unless
revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force for a period of two years from the
commencement date shown for the particular trade mark.

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed
in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations.  Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the
particular trade mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question.
However, where certain objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade
marks covering a diversity of goods, it has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the
intricacies of some of those Notices.  The Schedule clearly indicates where that applies with an
asterisk.  In any case prospective importers should seek further advice regarding the coverage of the
Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final paragraph below).

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a sign
that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are liable to
be seized by Customs, unless it can be established that:

−

−

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.);
or

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may,
or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark
in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of
the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas
owner of the trademark and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of the
Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement.

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under
the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a
suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the
meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an
infringement of"" a trade mark.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2001)

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2001) was tabled in the House of Representatives on 3 April 2001. The Proposal
contained amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to give effect to a decision by the Government to reduce
customs and excise duties on certain beer.

The customs duty on beer packaged in an individual container exceeding 48 litres has been reduced, as follows:
for beer of an alcoholic strength exceeding 1.15% but not exceeding 3.0% by volume, $15.96 per litre of alcohol;
for beer of an alcoholic strength exceeding 3.0% but not exceeding 3.5% by volume, $17.33 per litre of alcohol;
for beer of an alcoholic strength exceeding 3.5% by volume, $22.68 per litre of alcohol. In each case, customs
duty is calculated on that alcohol content by which the percentage by volume of alcohol exceeds 1.15%.

There has been no change to the customs duty on beer packaged in an individual container not exceeding 48
litres.

Equivalent changes have also been made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921.

Customs Tariff reprint pages issued in connection with these changes will be available in the week commencing
17 April 2001.

CHEESE AND CURD TARIFF QUOTA - ALLOCATIONS FOR

2001-2002

The Australian Customs Service (Customs) will shortly be advising importers of their allocation of cheese and
curd quota for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002.

Allocations have been based on the actual usage of quota in the 23 months ending 31 May 2001, as shown in
Customs records of clearances for home consumption. The 23 month period has been chosen to reflect the most
recent usage of quota.

The calculation of an importer's quota entitlement excludes any quota transferred to another importer during the
23 month period or unused as at 31 May 2001.

Importers are reminded that quota is allocated for a particular financial year and that to use their quota allocation
they are required to 'enter for home consumption' the cheese or curd by the end of the financial year to which the
allocation relates, ie by 30 June. For the cheese or curd to be 'entered for home consumption' by 30 June, an
entry for home consumption for the goods must be lodged with Customs and the vessel or aircraft carrying the
goods must have arrived at the first Australian port or airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged.

If neither condition is met by 30 June, the goods are taken to have been 'entered for home consumption' in the
following financial year. In such circumstances, the goods can be entered:

under quota for that financial year (if the importer has sufficient quota for that year); or
without quota at the rate of customs duty applicable to the relevant subheading of Schedule 3 of the Customs
Tariff.

Quota allocations are transferable between importers. An application to transfer quota entitlements may be made
by completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) and submitting it to:

Director Tariff Concessions Australian Customs Service Customs House 5 Constitution Avenue CANBERRA
CITY ACT 2601

Applicants are reminded that transfer applications are dealt with strictly in order of receipt and may take up to four
working days to process. This processing time is suspended when it is necessary to return an incomplete or
incorrect application, and resumes when the application is returned. Applications should be submitted well in
advance of intended use.

When printing the Form from the website and before submitting the application form to Customs, please ensure
that the form details appear on one page. That is the details relating to Part A appear on the front page and the
details relating to Part B appear on the reverse side. Further information on the Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme

intends to export those goods, the Collector may grant the importer permission to take delivery of those goods
upon giving a security or undertaking for the payment of duty, goods and services tax (GST) and/or luxury car tax
(LCT) payable on those goods.

Similarly, section 162A of the Act provides that the regulations may specify that certain goods may be brought into
Australia on a temporary basis without the payment of duty, GST or LCT if the goods are eligible under certain
international conventions on temporary admission acceded to by Australia.

Where goods are temporarily admitted under section 162 or 162A of the Act, and these goods have not been
exported, the importer is required to pay duty, GST and/or LCT. The amending regulations set out the
circumstances in which duty and/or taxes will not be payable on temporarily admitted goods even though those
goods are not exported from Australia.

Duty and/or taxes are will not be payable in respect of temporary imports in the following circumstances:

where goods, temporarily admitted under section 162 or 162A of the Act, are accidentally damaged or totally
destroyed, this includes damage or destruction due to an accident or force majeure; or

in the case of an animal, that animal dies or is destroyed due to an accident or illness which occurred whilst in
Australia; and

the goods or animal have no value as a direct result of the damage, destruction or death.

The Securities/Auxiliaries section in the region where the security is held must be contacted immediately if
damage occurs. In the event of an animal being euthanised, the animal should be destroyed under the
supervision of a qualified veterinarian and a report submitted to Customs stating why destruction was necessary.

Applications for the remission of duty, GST and LCT will be considered on a case by case basis. Evidentiary
material supporting the application for remission could include, but is not limited to, veterinarian reports, police
reports, insurance claims, photographs, video or television footage, newspaper articles or statutory declarations.

Remission of duty is not available when goods have been lost or stolen. In such cases the goods are deemed to
have entered the commerce of Australia, and duty, GST and/or LCT will be payable. This is consistent with world
best practice on temporary admission and is based on Article 14 of the Istanbul Convention (entered into force for
Australia on 27 November 1993).

Inquiries

Questions on the operation of the temporary import provisions may be directed to the Securities / Auxiliaries area
in the port of import, or to Mr Mark Jarratt, Manager (Temporary Imports &amp; Broker Licensing) on telephone

BRANDY EXPORTED FROM FRANCE FINDING

The
 Australian Customs Service has completed its investigation into the alleged
subsidisation of bottled brandy (the goods) exported to Australia from France.

In
 Report No. 40 Customs concluded that:

there have been exports of the goods from France at subsidised prices;

the Australian industry has suffered injury;

subsidised imports have caused material injury to the Australian industry producing like
goods; and

the goods are likely to continue to be exported to Australia at subsidised prices
causing material injury.

Customs recommended that countervailing action be taken against the goods exported from
France.

The Minister accepts the recommendations from Customs and declares that s.10 of
the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 applies to:

the goods and like goods exported to Australia from France after 26 April 2001
but before publication of this notice; and

like goods exported to Australia from France after 27 June 2001.

Customs will not publicise the subsidy levels, export prices and non-injurious prices
as they may reveal confidential details of the companies concerned. Individual
companies have been advised of the measures applicable to their transactions.

Report No. 40 contains the reasons for Customs' recommendation and is available on
request from the Trade Measures Office Management, Australian Customs Service,
Canberra, telephone (02) 6275 6057 or on the internet at: Trade Reports.

Interested parties may request a review of the Minister's decision by lodging an application
for review with the Trade Measures Review Officer in the approved form and manner
within 30 days of the publication of this notice. The legislation relating to
the review of Ministerial decisions is set out in the Customs Act 1901
commencing at s. 269ZZA.

INCREASE IN IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES FROM 1 JULY 2001

The 2001-02 Federal Budget announced that the Australian Customs Service (Customs) would receive an extra $238.8m over the next four years to strengthen Australia's defence
against the introduction of exotic pests and diseases, including foot and mouth disease.

Customs will use the funding to inspect 100 per cent of all high volume low value air cargo and mail entering Australia. Additionally, almost 100 per cent of all passengers and their
baggage arriving at international airports will be inspected.

The Budget statement indicated that the Government had decided to continue its policy of full cost recovery for these activities. This was estimated as $10.7m per annum. Following
discussions with the Customs National Consultative Committee meeting on 6 June 2001, it was decided to distribute the amount across the air and postal cargo clearance spectrum.

New regulations have been made under the Import Processing Charges Act 1997 to increase the charges.

There will be no increase on line charges. The new charges are as follows:

CONCESSIONAL ITEM 31 OF SCHEDULE 4 TO THE

CUSTOMS TARIFF ACT 1995 - GUIDELINES

In examining importations under item 31 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (""Item 31"") it is apparent
that some goods are being entered under the Item incorrectly. This Australian Customs Notice is therefore
provided for the information of importers and brokers to clarify the interpretation of the terms of Item 31.

Item 31 covers:

""Aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for use in the

manufacture, repair or maintenance of aircraft, other than:

1. textiles and goods made from textiles;
2. goods for use in the servicing of aircraft""

Putting aside the exclusions at (a) and (b), there are two variable criteria, which must be addressed. Those
criteria are that:

1. the goods are aircraft parts, materials or test equipment;

and

3. the goods are for use in the manufacture, repair or maintenance of aircraft.

To qualify as aircraft parts and materials the goods must form integral elements of an aircraft (materials are the
elements, substance or substances from which an aircraft is made or composed). Further, the parts and materials
must be consumed into the whole of the aircraft during the act of manufacture, repair or maintenance.

Test equipment only covers those instruments, apparatus or equipment used to test the aircraft or components of
the aircraft during the act of manufacture, repair or maintenance.

Examples of goods that do not qualify for duty free admission under Item 31 using these guidelines include, but
are not limited to:

- consumables, such as oil, fuel, food, beverages and the like, used in the servicing of aircraft;

- tools (including specialist hand tools), stands, towbars, hoists and jacks;

portable fire extinguishers;
headsets (including aviator headsets), lifejackets and liferafts;
aircraft navigation aids and refuelling equipment.

NOTE:

Entry requirements for Item 31 call for the goods to be entered under the tariff classification and statistical key
set out in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 before claiming the concessional Item.

Goods that attract a rate of duty of ""free"" in their own right under Schedule 3 are ineligible to claim Item 31 in
accordance with subsection 18(1) of the Customs Tariff Act 1995.

Importers and their brokers must verify at the time of entry for home consumption that the goods are initially
dutiable at a substantive rate of duty.

It is not a consideration when interpreting the terms of Item 31 that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, under its
Regulations, may require the inclusion of certain pieces of equipment mandatory for the operation of an
aircraft.

Where the goods are being imported for an aircraft under a specifically related project and the value of the project
exceeds $10 million, importers should give consideration to making an application through AusIndustry for project
status and the use of a Project By-Law concession.

Reporting of Cargo in Customs Cargo Automation Systems

Section 234(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) states, inter alia, that a person shall not knowingly or
recklessly make a statement to an officer that is false or misleading in a material particular or omit from a
statement made to an officer any matter or thing without which the statement is misleading in a material particular.

Customs has recently identified serious deficiencies in the reporting of air waybill numbers in Air Cargo
Automation (ACA) and container/bill of lading numbers in Sea Cargo Automation (SCA). Customs risk
management and control processes are dependent upon the accuracy of the information reported in Cargo
Automation systems. These numbers, reported in the relevant cargo automation system must be an accurate
representation of numbers recorded on the original document of carriage unless prior arrangements have been
made with Customs.

Cargo report manipulation often leads to consignments assessed as high-risk by Customs being delivered into
home consumption without examination. This is as a result of the consignment being re-reported with the
consignment identifiers changed contrary to the facts. An example of cargo report manipulation is where the
reporter adds an alpha or numeric character to a house air waybill number. A recent court decision has confirmed
that such action amounts to a false and misleading statement being made to an officer.

Air cargo and sea cargo depot operators licensed under section 77G of the Act are required to determine
consignment statuses from ACA or SCA at the time of intended delivery. Where a release status is not reflected in
the cargo system, diagnostic facilities should be accessed or the regional Cargo Systems Support Unit or its
equivalent should be contacted, to determine why a release status may not be available. Re-reporting
consignments with new, incorrect, air waybill or container/bill of lading details does not constitute a legitimate
means of gaining a release status and may be a breach of section 234(1)(d) of the Act.

Indexation of Certain Excise and Customs Tariff Duty Rates and  
the Diesel Fuel Rebate – August 2001 

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the 
Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer 
(except “home brew”), tobacco, and certain petroleum based oils and lubricants and 
their synthetic equivalents increased on 1 August 2001.  (In accordance with the 
Government’s decision announced on 1 March 2001, the duty rates for petroleum 
products are no longer subject to indexation).  The new rates are set out in Tables 
1 and 2 of the Attachment to this Notice. 

The new rates of duty and excise listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment are 
calculated by multiplying the current rates by an indexation factor.  This factor has 
been calculated by dividing the most recent index number by the previous highest 
December or June index number.  Accordingly, the June 2001 index number (133.8) 
has been divided by the December 2000 number (131.3) to establish an indexation 
factor of 1.019.  As this factor is more than one, current rates of excise and customs 
duty were increased by this factor. 

As rates of excise and customs duty relating to petroleum fuels have not been 
adjusted, no amendment to the rates of diesel fuel rebate is necessary.

SPACE CONCESSION - (NEW) ITEM 69

Legislative Provisions

On 27 June 2001, Customs Tariff Proposal No.5 (2001) was tabled in Parliament. This proposal provides for the
creation of a new concessional item (item 69) in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff).

Item 69 will enable, from 1 August 2001, the duty free entry of certain goods imported into Australia for use in
authorised space projects.

Item 69 covers:

Goods, as prescribed by by-law, entered for home consumption on or after 1 August
2001, being for use in a space project authorised by the Minister for Industry, Science
and Resources.

Terms and Conditions of item 69

This concession enables certain goods to enter duty free under item 69, providing specific conditions are met. It
will facilitate the transfer to Australia of sophisticated space-related technology and technical expertise.

The Department of Industry, Science and Resources, which has responsibility for the administration of item 69,
will be issuing policy and administrative guidelines containing the terms and conditions for access to the new
concession.

Access to the new concession will be in two stages:

Stage 1 - An applicant will need to seek authorisation of the space project from the Minister for Industry,
Science and Resources if the project has not already been authorised; and
Stage 2 - An applicant will need to seek authorisation that the goods intended to be imported are for use in an
authorised space project.

Determinations will only be made under item 69 if both of these requirements are satisfied. Details of the specific
requirements, including ""project authorisation"", the ""identification of goods for use in an authorised space project"",
as well as other information, will be set out in the policy and administrative guidelines.

Administration

The Department of Industry, Science and Resources are responsible for the administration of item 69 including
the processing of applications for access to the item.

Customs Requirements

Importers wishing to avail themselves of item 69 are required to enter the goods under their normal tariff
classifications and statistical keys set out in Schedule 3 to the Tariff before claiming the concessional item by
quoting the treatment code 469 and the appropriate Determination number.

It should be noted there is already a significant range of space-related goods that attract a ""free"" rate of duty. For
example, satellites, launch vehicles, telemetry and launch equipment are free of duty under Schedule 3 of the
Tariff. In certain circumstances, goods of a scientific nature are also free of duty under concessional item 16 of
Schedule 4 to the Tariff.

Importers are reminded that, in accordance with subsection 18(1) of the Tariff, goods that attract a ""free"" rate of
duty in their own right under Schedule 3 to the Tariff are ineligible to claim item 69. Therefore, importers and
brokers must verify that the goods are initially dutiable at a substantive rate at the time of lodging an application
with the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, and when entering the goods for home consumption.

It is the responsibility of importers to ensure that goods imported using item 69 are, in fact, eligible imports.
Importers may be audited to ensure the correct use of item 69 of Schedule 4 to the Tariff and the corresponding
Determination.

AUTOMOTIVE COMPETITIVENESS AND INVESTMENT

SCHEME (ACIS) AMENDMENTS TO CUSTOMS REFUND

REGULATIONS

Australian Customs Notice No.2001/24 provides information to interested parties about the introduction of the
Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme (ACIS) which is administered by AusIndustry, a division of
the Department of Industry Science and Resources.

Item 41E of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 provides a concessional rate of duty on certain automotive
goods, prescribed by by-law, imported by a person who applies ACIS credits to that importation.

Associated with the introduction of ACIS, amendments have been made to the Customs refund regulations to
permit importers to apply for refunds of duty in return for ACIS credits. These amendments take effect from 17
August 2001 and were published in Special Gazette No S339 of that date.

Under the new refund circumstance, paragraph 126(1)(z) of the Customs Regulations 1926, importers will be able
to apply for a refund where they have:

imported relevant automotive goods but did not own any duty credits at the time of importation and they have
subsequently become the owner of duty credits;

imported goods under item 41E offsetting some of the duty payable on the goods and they subsequently
become the owner of additional duty credits; and

failed to import the goods under item 41E even though they owned duty credits at the time.

Procedure for applying for a Refund

To claim a refund of Customs duty, in return for duty credits earned under ACIS, a customer must transfer those
credits to the Commonwealth.

To transfer ACIS credits to the Commonwealth the owner of the ACIS credits will need to complete a Notification
of a Movement of ACIS Credits to the Commonwealth form and lodge it with AusIndustry.

On receipt of this form, AusIndustry will move the credits to the Commonwealth Ledger account. They will then
write to the applicant (or their broker as applicable) advising that that the credits are available to be used for
refund purposes.

The applicant can then formally lodge a refund claim with Customs in the normal manner.

Information on the Customs refund circumstance in relation to ACIS may be directed to Michael Kearns (Refunds
Section) on telephone (02) 6275 5805 or email to michael.kearns@customs.gov.au.

Amendments to the Australian Customs Tariff Resulting from

the Second Review of the Harmonized Commodity

Description and Coding System

ACN 2001/13 advised of changes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly
referred to as the Harmonized System (HS). The HS forms the basis of Australia's Customs Tariff and the
Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC). The HS is sponsored by the World Customs
Organization (WCO) and is reviewed every five years. The aim of the current review (the second) is to amend the
HS to reflect changing patterns of international trade, to separately identify new products (for example, certain
categories of waste) and to reflect changes in industry practices and technological developments.

The requested amendments to the HS are incorporated in Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2001. This Bill
contains approximately 800 amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The Bill was passed by the House of
Representatives on 23 August 2001 and by the Senate on 30 August 2001 and it is expected that it will receive
the Royal Assent in the near future.

The legislation has been designed to preserve existing duty rates and margins of tariff preference accorded
Australia's trading partners. To achieve this, a large number of national tariff splits have been created in addition
to the changes recommended by the WCO.

The HS changes are spread throughout the Customs Tariff and have at least some impact on most industries and
commodity groups.

In some cases, for example, refined petroleum products of heading 2710, and paper and paper products of
Chapter 48, the resulting domestic structure required to preserve existing duty rates and margins of preference is
complex. However, the established rules of tariff classification will continue to apply and the description of those
goods will simply lead to classification in a different tariff heading or subheading.

The HS second review specifies that certified reference materials are to be classified solely in tariff heading 3822.
Certified reference materials are defined as ""materials used for analytical purposes and which are accompanied
by a certificate specifying the values of their certified properties"". A single tariff subheading, 3822.00.50, has been
created for these goods and assigned a duty rate of Free. Item 63 in Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff will
continue to apply to certain other reference materials.

Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2001 will be available for purchase from Government bookshops later this
year and also through the Parliament House website.

Prior to that occurring however, a useful summary of the changes is available on the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) website. This may be accessed on the internet at www.abs.gov.au. Then select Themes,
International Trade, Classification - Harmonized System Review 2002. This website also invites comments on the
proposed statistical codes for the new or revised tariff headings and subheadings.

A concordance of tariff items affected by the changes is available with this ACN from the Australian Customs
website. This concordance should be read in conjunction with the two accompanying summary documents: a
general explanation of the changes and a summary of the changes that result from the amendment of Note 7 to
Chapter 48. This Note has been renumbered as Note 8 and specifies the sizes of paper and paperboard
permitted in headings 4801 to 4811 of the Customs Tariff.

Copies of these documents can also be e-mailed, if required, to Customs clients. For this purpose, please e-mail
your request to TARLEG@customs.gov.au.

Revised Customs Tariff working pages incorporating these changes will be printed and distributed in early
December.

A separate ACN will be issued in the near future in respect of Tariff Advices, TAPIN, Tariff Concession Orders and
by-laws affected by the changes.

If you require any further information about the changes to the Customs Tariff, please contact Judy Sutton,
Manager, Tariff Legislation and External Review, on (02) 6275 6486 or Nick Blackaby, Customs Supervisor, Tariff

____________________________________________________________________ 

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION 
TRADE MARKS ACT 1995 

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under Section 132 of the 
Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule which have 
applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade mark/s.  Unless 
revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force for a period of two years from the 
commencement date shown for the particular trade mark. 

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods prescribed 
in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations.  Unless the Schedule indicates to the contrary, the 
particular trade mark relates to the specific goods listed in regard to the trade mark/s in question.  
However, where certain objectors have lodged a Notice of Objection in regard to a variety of trade 
marks covering a diversity of goods, it has not been feasible to comprehensively reflect the 
intricacies of some of those Notices.  The Schedule clearly indicates where that applies with an 
asterisk.  In any case prospective importers should seek further advice regarding the coverage of the 
Notice of Objection from their local Customs office (in accordance with the final paragraph below). 

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a 
sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade mark they are 
liable to be seized by Customs, unless it can be established that: 

− 

− 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); 
or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark 
may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the 
mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered 
owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an 
overseas owner of the trademark and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of 
the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under 
the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a 
suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the 
meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an 
infringement of"" a trade mark.

TRADE MARKS ACT 1995  
TRADE MARKS REGULATONS 

This Customs notice is to provide advice to owners and authorised users of trade 
marks registered in Australia, and to importers who may import goods to which trade 
marks have been applied.  The operation of the Customs seizure provisions of the Act 
was most recently published in ACN 2000/79. 

This notice gives a brief outline of amendments to the Trade Marks Act 1995 (the 
Act) and the Trade Marks Regulations (the Regulations).  Amendments to the Act 
were passed by Parliament on 22 August 2001 and will came into effect on 19 
September.  Additionally, changes to the regulations also took effect on 19 
September.  The changes to the import provisions summarised below 

Subsection 132(3) - changes the conditions under which an authorised user may lodge 
a Notice of Objection.   

Under previous provisions, if, within the prescribed period (2 months), a registered 
owner did not comply with a request to lodge a Notice of Objection, the authorised 
user could lodge the Notice.  Where the registered owner gave permission within that 
prescribed period, the previous provision did not allow the authorised user to lodge 
the notice until the expiration of the 2 month period.   

The amendments allow the authorised user to lodge the Notice during the prescribed 
period if the consent of the registered owner is obtained, or where, within that period, 
an owner refuses a request to give a Notice. 

Section 137(5) – changes the period within which an Objector must obtain a court 
order to prevent the CEO from releasing the goods. 

The provision relates to the period during which Customs holds goods seized under 
the Act when an objector has initiated civil action.  Under previous provision, if, after 
a period of three weeks there is no order from the court preventing the goods from 
being released, the CEO must release them to the designated owner. 

The amendments change the statutory period for holding the goods from 3 weeks to 
20 working days.  ""Working days"" is defined as not including a Saturday, Sunday or a 
public holiday in the ACT.  The change also makes it clear that the court’s order in 
relation to the goods must be directed at the CEO. 

Regulation 13(1) – changes the prescribed documents required to accompany a Notice 
of Objection.

Luxury Car Tax

This notice is designed to clarify the treatment of luxury car tax (LCT) on entries for home consumption. It
supplements the information that was included on pages 11 and 12 of the COMPILE Manual Supplement issued
in May 2000.

Liability for LCT

The A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 (LCT Act) imposes LCT on the importation of luxury cars. A
luxury car is defined as a car whose LCT value exceeds the LCT threshold. The threshold for the 2001-2002
financial year is $55,134 (unchanged from 2000-2001).

For importations, the LCT value is the sum of:

the customs value of the car; and

the amount paid or payable for the international transport of the car to its place of consignment in Australia
and to insure the car for that transport; and

any customs duty payable on the car; and

the GST payable on the car.

LCT is payable on importations of luxury cars unless the importer quotes their ABN or the importation is otherwise
exempted from LCT under subsection 7-10(3) or section 25-1 of the LCT Act. LCT is not payable on temporary
importations of cars if the requirements of s162 or s162A of the Customs Act 1901 and Subdivision 13-B of the
LCT Act are complied with.

Note that a car whose importation LCT value is less than the LCT threshold is not a luxury car at the time of entry
for home consumption, even if it is expected that its LCT value at a subsequent retail sale will exceed the LCT
threshold.

COMPILE processing

In cases where the LCT value exceeds the LCT threshold:

each entry line must have one car only; and

each entry line must be dealt with in one of the following ways:

validly quoting the importer's ABN, or

using a valid exemption code, or

paying the LCT.

Where LCT is not applicable, importers must not quote their ABN or claim an exemption. In these circumstances,
importers may include several cars on a single entry line.

Note, an importer's quoting of their ABN for LCT deferral purposes is separate from the requirement for all
importers who have an ABN to include it in their entries. The process to be used by importers when quoting for
LCT deferral is described in the following section.

Quoting for LCT

Generally, an importer is entitled to quote their ABN if they have the intention of using the car for one of the
following purposes, and for no other purpose:

holding the car as trading stock (other than for hire or lease), or

CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT ACT (No. 4) 2001

Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 4) 2001 - Act No. 145 of 2001 (the Act) - received the Royal Assent on 1
October 2001. It amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) by enacting changes previously included in the
following Customs Tariff Proposals:

Proposal No. 1 (2001) - amended items 41A to 41C in Schedule 4 of the Tariff and created new items 41F and
41G in relation to the cessation of the ""Administrative Arrangements to the Year 2000 for the Automotive
Industry"" and the commencement of the ""Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme"" (ACIS) on 1
January 2001. This Proposal also created item 68 in Schedule 4 in connection with the SPARTECA (TCF)
Provisions Scheme. ACN 2001/16 refers;

Proposal No. 4 (2001) - implemented amendments to item 17 of Schedule 4 (re-imported goods) to introduce
a re-import concession for goods, which, when first imported utilised duty credit owned under ACIS. ACN
2001/39 refers; and

Proposal No. 5 (2001) - created item 69 in Schedule 4 in connection with the duty free entry of goods for use
in authorised space projects. ACN 2001/48 refers.

The Act also amends item 44 of the Tariff. This item provides concessional entry for particular imported goods
that are for use in the manufacture of excisable goods in terms of section 24 of the Excise Act 1901. The
amendment removes the link between item 44 and the Table in section 19(1) of the Tariff.

A new Table has been inserted in item 44 to list all the tariff subheadings and items and their complementary
excise tariff items to which item 44 applies. The new Table is further amended to reflect changes to the Tariff
resulting from the second review of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System that will occur on
1 January 2002 (ACN 2001/53 refers). Some of these changes affect the tariff subheadings listed in the Table.

The Act amends the list of Least Developed Countries in Schedule 1 to the Tariff by including Senegal. Senegal is
presently treated as a Developing Country subject to DCS rates of duty. This amendment is operative from 15
October 2001.

The Act also includes a technical change to the description of goods in tariff subheadings 2709.00.10 and
2710.00.11 to replace the reference to ""section 34 of the Excise Tariff Act 1901"" with ""Part IV of the Excise Tariff
Act 1901"".

Any queries regarding these changes should be directed to Judy Sutton on (02) 6275 6486 or Nick Blackaby on
(02) 6275 6506.

Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 4) 2001 also creates a new item 70 in Schedule 4 for split consignments.
The new item combines elements of the existing items 43 and 52 and will streamline the operation of this
concession.

New item 71 is created to give effect to the new Project By-laws Scheme. This expanded Scheme replaces the
existing Scheme that operates through items 45, 46 and 56 of Schedule 4.

These new items commence on 1 July 2002 and will be administered by the Department of Industry, Science and
Resources through AusIndustry. Any queries regarding the new Project By-laws Scheme should be directed to
the Manager, Customs Policy Section, Department of Industry, Science and Resources on (02) 6213 7825.

Tariff reprint pages for most of these amendments were issued at the time the relevant Proposals were tabled in
Parliament. Pages reflecting the reclassification of Senegal as a Least Developed Country and the technical
changes in Chapter 27 will be issued in the week commencing 15 October 2001. For the remaining changes,
reprint pages will be issued in early December.

OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION ACT 1987

Introduction

This is a guide to the operation of the import provisions of the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 (the Act) and is intended for the owners and licensed users of registered olympic
expressions. Amendments to the Act, which established the import provisions, received Royal Assent on 1 October and will come into effect on 29 October 2001.

The import provisions of the Act permit the owner or the exclusive licensee of registered olympic expressions to object to the importation of goods which use protected olympic
expressions for commercial purposes. It is recommended that before lodging a Notice of Objection this matter be discussed with a legal adviser.

The purpose of the Act is to assist in the preservation of Australia as a participant in, and a supporter of, the world Olympic movement.

1. Outline

Section 52 of the Act allows the AOC or a licensed user to lodge a Notice of Objection in relation to the importation of goods which bear a protected olympic expression and section 54
empowers Customs to seize contravening goods.

Protected olympic expressions are:

Olympic
Olympics
Olympic Games
Olympiad
Olympiads

An expression so closely resembling a protected olympic expression mentioned above that it is likely to be mistaken by a reasonable person as a protected olympic expression, is taken
to be a protected olympic expression.

To avoid doubt, the expressions 'Olympian' and 'Olympians' are taken not to resemble a protected olympic expression.

2. Notice of Objection to Importation

The AOC or a licensed user may object to the importation of goods that have a protected olympic expression applied to them. The Notice of Objection will have effect in respect of goods
bearing a protected olympic expression, imported by a designated owner who is not authorised or licensed to use the expressions.

The Notice takes effect when it is accepted by Customs and does not operate retrospectively. It is expected that Notices of Objection will remain valid for a period of four years, or until
the expiry of relevant license agreements, whichever is sooner. A Notice of Objection may be revoked by giving notice in writing to the Chief Executive Officer of Customs at any time, or
if the license is revoked.

3. The Security

A security is required to reimburse the Commonwealth for any expenses that may be incurred by it in seizing goods as a result of action taken under section 54 of the Act. The security
may be provided as a cash deposit or in documentary form. Cash securities are held in trust and unused portions are returned when the Notice of Objection is no longer in place.

Customs practice is to require that sureties to a Customs security be either an Australian bank or guarantee company which has been approved as a surety to Customs securities. A list
of these institutions is available from Customs offices. Where the expenses exceed the security the amount of the excess is a debt due to Customs.

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported with a

− 

− 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); 
or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark 
may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the 
mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered 
owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an 
overseas owner of the trademark and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of 
the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who have been planning commitments to import goods that may be liable to seizure under 
the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a 
suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the 
meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an 
infringement of"" a trade mark.

Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification -

2002 Edition

The 2002 edition of the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) becomes operative on
1 January 2002.

The AHECC is compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and is designed for use by exporters,
customs brokers and freight forwarders for the classification of goods when providing export declarations to the
Australian Customs Service, and to assist users in the interpretation of export statistics published by the ABS.

This edition of the AHECC reflects changes arising from the second review, by the World Customs Organization,
of the international Harmonized System 6-digit categories, as outlined in ACNs 2001/13 and 53. It also reflects
changes due to:

the creation of new statistical codes to reflect changes in technology and user requests;
the rationalisation of units of quantity used in reporting trade;
the creation of more meaningful descriptors for existing categories; and
the amalgamation of categories for which there are low volumes of trade.

The AHECC will be available on 13 December 2001, free of charge from the ABS web site (www.abs.gov.au, see
Themes, International Trade, Publications, Australian Harmonized Commodity Classification (Cat no. 1233.0)).
Printed copies will also be distributed free of charge to existing subscribers at the same time. Any users without
internet access, and not on the ABS Subscription List, are able to receive a copy of the AHECC by contacting
ABS Subscription Services on 1300 366 323. Please allow four to six weeks for delivery.

Users of the AHECC should note that this is expected to be the final issue distributed in printed form. Future
replacement pages to update the classification and explanatory notes, normally issued six monthly, and
subsequent new editions, are expected to be released electronically. Replacement pages will be available from
the ABS web site starting in mid 2002. Users are encouraged to stay up to date with changes to the AHECC by
monitoring the ABS web site.

Queries regarding this ACN should be directed to Sharyn Sturgeon on (02) 6252 5310 or Marion Hall (02) 6252

Processing of Tariff Advices and Valuation Advices where

insufficient information is provided.

The purpose of this notice is to advise of a change of policy in relation to the processing of Tariff Advices (TAs)
and Valuation Advices (VAs) where insufficient information is provided by the client to enable Customs to process
the advice.

TAs and VAs are rejected when an applicant does not respond to Customs requests for additional information
within the specified timeframes. Previously, the specified timeframe was 14 days.

Customs recognises that it can frequently take longer than 14 days to source information from overseas clients.
Accordingly, applicants who are requested to provide additional information will now have 28 days from date of
the request to provide that information. If an applicant is unable to provide the information within the 28-day
period, they may write to the Manager Tariff/Valuation in their region, requesting an extension of time. The
application for extension must clearly state the reasons for the request.

Where sufficient information is not provided within the 28-day period (or within an extended time period granted
by the Manager Tariff/Valuation), the TA/VA will be rejected.

This procedure will become effective from the date of this notice.

SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme - Incorrect Entry

The Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources (DITR) - Program Administrator of the SPARTECA (TCF
Provisions) Scheme - has completed the first six-monthly review of the scheme. It concluded that many goods
imported under the scheme were being entered incorrectly.

Goods qualifying for duty free entry under the scheme should be entered under item 68 of Schedule 4 to
the Customs Tariff Act 1995, not under the preference arrangements for the South Pacific Regional Trade and
Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA). Information on entering goods under the scheme is provided in
Australian Customs Notice No. 2001/01.

There are two standard declarations that can be used by exporters from Forum Island countries - one for goods
that meet the normal preference requirements of SPARTECA (that includes a minimum 50 per cent local area
content) and the other for goods that qualify under the scheme (that includes a 35 per cent to 50 per cent local
area content).

It is important that importers and brokers check the declarations provided with the import documents for goods
from Forum Island countries and ensure that goods are entered correctly in accordance with those declarations.

Inquiries:

Any questions on SPARTECA, the calculation of local area content and entry under scheme through item 68
should be directed to Ms Lyndall Milward-Bason, Manager Origin,Customs, on 02 6275 6551.

** ATTENTION - NO TITLE OR NOTICE NUMBER**

The Australian Customs Service has completed its investigation into the alleged dumping of certain coated woodfree (CWF) paper sheets exported from the countries shown above.

Customs established that coated woodfree paper is not exported to Australia from Luxembourg and accordingly, the investigation addressed exports from Belgium, not
Belgium/Luxembourg.

In accordance with s. 269TDA(1) of the Customs Act 1901, Customs terminated its investigation so far as it related to:

KNP Leykam Overseas GmbH (Belgium);
Job Scheufelen (France);
SCA Fine Paper GmbH and Zanders Feinpapier AG (Germany);
Tjiwi Kimia (Indonesia); and
Cartiere Di Sarego and Pepco S.A.S (Italy).

The preliminary finding is that:

2. there are sufficient grounds for the publication of a dumping duty notice for goods exported from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, The

Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan.

3. there are not sufficient grounds for the publication of a dumping duty notice for goods exported from Finland by UPM-Kymmene Corporation, the Republic of South Africa and

Sweden and for exports of CWF paper sheets weighing less than 90 grams per square metre.

Securities under section 42 of the Customs Act 1901 have been imposed in respect of any duty that may become payable on exports from:

KNP Leykam Overseas GmbH from Austria;
Enso Fine Papers Oy and Metsa-Serla Oy from Finland;
Hannover Papier AG, Nordland Papier GmbH and Stora Fine Paper AB from Germany;
DaiEi Paper Ltd, Japan Pulp and Paper Co Ltd and The Okamoto Co Ltd from Japan;
Shinmoorim Paper Manufacturing Co Ltd from Korea;
KNP Leykam Overseas GmbH from The Netherlands;
Papier Fabrik Biberist AG from Switzerland; and
Yuen Foong Yu Manufacturing Co Ltd from Taiwan.

A summary of the preliminary finding report is attached to this Notice. A non-confidential copy of the report will be sent to those parties who made submissions to the investigation.
Copies also will be available on request from the Office Manager, Dumping Office Management, Australian Customs Service, Canberra, telephone (02) 6275 6057 or facsimile (02) 6275
6990.

Customs will now refer the positive preliminary finding to the Anti-Dumping Authority which must hold an inquiry and report to the Minister for Customs as to whether dumping duties
should be imposed. The Authority will advise interested parties of the details and procedures for its inquiry.

Rate of exchange for the entry of goods

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) outlines the procedures to be followed in establishing the ""day of
exportation"" for exchange rate purposes. It replaces ACN No. 90/41.

Legislation

Subsection 161J(1) of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) requires that, when ascertaining the value of any
imported goods, an amount in a foreign currency be expressed in Australian currency according to the rate of
exchange on the day of exportation.

Subsection 161J(4) states that the ""day of exportation"" means:

a. where the goods were exported by post from the place of export and a Collector is satisfied as to the day of

posting-that day;

b. where the goods departed or were transported from their place of export in any other way and a Collector is

satisfied as to the day of their departure or transportation-that day; and

c. in any other case-a day determined by the Collector.

Section 154 of the Customs Act defines the place of export. Put simply, the place of export for imported goods, in
hierarchical order, is:

a. the place where the goods were posted to Australia;
b. the place where the goods were packed in a container;
c. for self-transported goods exported from a country by sea or air, the place, or last place, in that country from

which the goods departed for Australia;

d. for goods exported from a country by sea or air, the place, or first place, in that country where the goods were

placed on board a ship or aircraft for export from that country;

e. for goods exported from a country by land, or by river, canal or other inland waterway, the place at which the
goods finally crossed the border from that country into another country in the course of their transportation to
Australia; or

f. in any other case, a place determined by a Collector.

Evidence

It is the responsibility of the owner of the imported goods to obtain sufficient reliable evidence of the day of
exportation.

For goods packed in a container, the rate of exchange to be used is the rate applying on the day that the goods
leave the place where the goods were packed in the container. Where such information is not known, the rate of
exchange that can be used may be determined in the same manner as for non-containerised goods exported by
air or sea, outlined below.

Goods exported from a country by air

The rate of exchange to be used is the rate applying on the day that the aircraft departs the country of export.

The departure date and the aircraft flight number are normally shown on the Air Waybill when it is issued. If these
details are altered after the Air Waybill is issued, the Air Waybill will be manually amended to show the departure
date and the new flight number. These details are available for checking on Cargo Automation Systems or from
Cargo Manifests.

Goods exported from a country by sea

The rate of exchange to be used is the rate applying on the day that the vessel departs from the loading port. This
date can be obtained from the 'on board' date endorsed on the Bill of Lading or the Sea Waybill. If this date is
unavailable, the date of departure of the vessel should be obtained from the shipping company.

Published rates of exchange

Customs issues rates of exchange for selected currencies for each day. Those rates are published in
the Commonwealth of AustraliaGazette each week.

Ready to Drink Beverages (RTDs) Manufactured from Imported Spirits

In July 2000 Schedule 2 to the Excise Regulations were amended to include an item that covers the manufacture of RTDs from imported spirits. The wording of the item incorporated a
requirement that a majority of Australian spirit is to be used. This requirement was consistent with an existing provision for blending imported spirit with like excisable spirit,ie, rum with
rum. In November 2000, this item was amended to its current wording eliminating the requirement for Australian spirit.

Since July 2000, RTDs have continued to be manufactured in Customs warehouses and the finished product has been cleared using the classification of RTD.

Customs, in consultation with Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and industry has determined that this procedure is no longer acceptable. From 1 February 2002 manufacturers of RTDs
using imported spirit must make use of Item 44 of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (CTA).

In accordance with this determination, the following procedures will apply post 1 February 2002

At the time of importation the bulk spirit must be entered for warehousing. This is a requirement of Section 104 of the Customs Act. Prior to manufacture taking place, the lodgement of a
Nature 30 entry will be required using Item 44 of the CTA. The ad valorem duty will be paid at this point. Revenue payments of these amounts may be made per the normal duty
payment arrangements applying to Weekly Settlement Permission holders, effectively transferring the responsibility for monitoring the revenue liability from Customs to ATO control. After
the point of manufacture manufacturers will need to account for the spirit used and for the finished product, to the ATO Excise Business line..

Remissions for losses prior to the nature 30 entry being made will be submitted to Customs and will be for the ad valorem duty as well as the fixed rate duty per litre of alcohol (Lal).
Remissions for losses that occur after the nature 30 entry has been made will need to be submitted to the ATO. Only the duty per Lal will be remitted in this case. There is no scope to
refund the ad valorem duty that would have already been paid.

Owners may wish to enter all finished product on hand on 1 February 2002 using Item 44 of the CTA. If this is not done sufficient records need to be maintained to ensure that correct
duty is eventually paid. This will be particularly important when underbond sales are made.

Manufacturers should inform their underbond customers of the changed status of these products so that the finished product is correctly entered for home consumption.

Further details on this matter are available from the Manager Commercial Compliance (Tobacco, Alcohol &amp; Petroleum) in your state.

1958 and the Customs Regulations 1926

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956, the Customs (Prohibited
Exports) Regulations 1958 and the Customs Regulations 1926 were notified in Special Gazette No. S74 of 7
March 2002. The amendments commenced on gazettal.

UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL - SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBERIA

On 7 March 2001 the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed Resolution 1343 (2001) obliging member
countries, including Australia, to impose further sanctions against Liberia. These latest sanctions against Liberia
are aimed at stopping the flow of arms, war-related mat riel and funds to warring factions in neighbouring Sierra
Leone. This Resolution builds on earlier sanctions imposed in UNSC Resolution 985 (1995) of 13 April 1995,
which placed an arms embargo on Liberia.

Imports of diamonds from Liberia

The sanctions impose a total prohibition on the direct or indirect importation of rough diamonds from Liberia,
whether on not the diamonds originate from Liberia. The prohibition is implemented by regulation 4P of
the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956.

Export of certain goods destined for Liberia

The sanctions also prohibit the exportation to Liberia of arms and related mat riel of all types, including weapons
and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment and all spare parts. The prohibition is
implemented by regulation 13CK of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958.

The exportation of paramilitary equipment and spare parts to Liberia is prohibited unless a permission in writing to
export the goods, given by the Foreign Minister or an authorised person in the Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade, is presented to Customs at or before the time of exportation.

The sanctions do not restrict the supply of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian and
protective use as determined by the Security Council Sanctions Committee for Liberia.

Any enquiries concerning the above amendments should be directed to the Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade, Canberra on (02) 6261 2603.

Those aspects of the resolution that relate to arms, weapons, ammunition, military vehicles and equipment and
spare parts are implemented under existing regulation 13E of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations
1958. Regulation 13E prohibits the exportation from Australia of those goods unless a permission in writing to
export the goods given by the Minister for Defence or an authorised person of the Department of Defence, is
presented to Customs at or before the time of exportation.

Any enquiries concerning permits for items included on the Defence Strategic Goods List should be directed to
the Department of Defence, Canberra, on (02) 6266 4392.

SCHEDULE 2, CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED IMPORTS) REGULATIONS 1956 - AMENDMENTS AND ADDITIONS

As a result of an Australasian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) resolution to develop a uniform prohibited
weapons (non-firearms) list, the definitions of 10 existing items have been amended and 13 new items have been
included in Schedule 2.

The definitions of the following items have been amended:

Item 9 - daggers
Item 12 - electric shock devices
Item 13 - acoustic shock devices
Item 18 - blowpipes and blowguns

Indexation of Certain Excise and Customs Tariff Duty Rates – February 2002 

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the 
Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer (except 
“home brew”), tobacco, petroleum based oils and greases and their synthetic 
equivalents increased on 1 February 2002.  The new rates are set out in Tables 1 and 2 
of the Attachment 1 to this Notice. 

The new rates of duty and excise listed in Tables 1 and 2 of Attachment 1 are indexed 
by multiplying the current rates by an indexation factor.  This factor has been 
calculated by dividing the most recent index number by the previous highest December 
or June index number.  Accordingly, the December 2001 index number (135.4) has 
been divided by the June 2001 index number (133.8) to establish an indexation factor 
of 1.012.  As this factor is more than one, current rates of excise and customs duty will 
be increased by this factor. 

As rates of excise and customs duty relating to petroleum fuels have not been adjusted, 
no amendment to the rates of diesel fuel rebate is necessary. 

Any enquiries concerning these matters should be directed to:

____________________________________________________________________ 

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION 
TRADE MARKS ACT 1995 

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under section 132 of 
the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule 
which have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade 
mark/s.  Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force for a period of two years 
from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark. 

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods 
prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations, while the reference to goods 
indicates to which goods the trade mark registration relates.  Prospective importers of such 
goods should seek further advice regarding the ambit of the Notice of Objection from their 
local Customs office. 

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported 
with a sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade 
mark, they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, 
etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade 
mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not 
infringed where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the 
consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied 
by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trademark and the goods are imported 
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still 
represent an infringement. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the 
provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a 
suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and 
the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an 
infringement of"" a trade mark.

Preferential Access for Wholly Manufactured Goods

Incorporating a Determined Manufactured Raw Material

(DMRM)

This notice deals with preferential access for goods that incorporate a determined manufactured raw material
(DMRM) and that are traded between Australia and New Zealand and between Australia and Canada.

A DMRM is a material that is imported into a country but is determined by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Australian Customs Service (Customs), or his delegate, to be the manufactured raw material of that country.

Imports from New Zealand and Canada

Preferential access

Preferential rates of customs duty for goods that are produced or manufactured in various countries, including
New Zealand and Canada, are set out in the Customs Tariff Act 1995.

Division 1A of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) sets out rules for determining whether goods are
the produce or manufacture of a particular country, other than Australia. Sections 153J and 153P of the Customs
Act provide that goods are the manufacture of New Zealand or of Canada, respectively where:

1. they are wholly manufactured in the country; or
2. where the last process of manufacture was performed in the country and a certain level of local content was

achieved.

Wholly manufactured criterion

Under subsections 153J(1) and 153P(2), respectively, goods are wholly manufactured in New Zealand or in
Canada where they were wholly manufactured from one or more of the following:

1. unmanufactured raw materials;
2. materials wholly manufactured within New Zealand and/or Australia, or within Canada and/or Australia, as the

case may be;

3. materials imported into New Zealand or into Canada, as the case may be, that have been determined, by

notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette (Gazette), to be DMRMs of that country.

Goods manufactured in New Zealand or in Canada that incorporate a DMRM may be imported into Australia at a
preferential rate of customs duty, provided that the goods do not contain imported materials that were
manufactured in a country other than Australia.

A list of DMRMs that have been granted for New Zealand and for Canada has been published in Gazette No. TC
02/09 of 6 March 2002. An extract from that Gazette is attached for information.

Application for a DMRM

Exporters in New Zealand and in Canada may apply to the relevant authority in their country for a DMRM in
Australia. That authority will contact Customs for consideration of the application and for notification of the DMRM
application.

A DMRM will be granted where there is no manufacture of the materials in New Zealand or in Australia, or in
Canada or in Australia, as the case may be.

Australia and New Zealand have agreed on the following core criteria for granting a DMRM:

the materials are eligible for duty-free entry or for duty concessions (including a tariff concession) in New
Zealand and in Australia; and
there are no objections from manufacturers of the relevant material, or a substitutable or suitable material in
either country.

Review of the Customs Valuation Legislation

In 1999, the then Department of Industry, Science and Resources released a report titled 'The Review of the
Customs Valuation Legislation'. The recommendations in that report are attached to this Australian Customs
Notice.

The first four recommendations propose amendment of the valuation provisions of the Customs Act
1901 (Customs Act).

The Minister for Justice and Customs has sought, and received, support from the Prime Minister and from
relevant Ministers for the amendment of the valuation legislation.

As a first step to amending the valuation legislation, the Australian Customs Service (Customs) has prepared a
set of legislative guidelines. A copy of the guidelines can be obtained from the Customs Web page
at http://cww.customs.gov.au/ecom/prodn/homepage/NOTICES/acn02/legguide2002.pdf.

The legislative guidelines are designed to:

emphasise that the transaction value is the principal means of determining the customs value of imported
goods, and to direct that, where that method cannot be used, the hierarchy of valuation methods outlined in
the World Trade Organization Agreement on Customs Valuation (the Valuation Agreement) must be followed;

ensure that Australia's valuation legislation reflects the language and terminology of the Valuation Agreement;

propose that the revised legislation uses plain English, adopts a more logical structure, and contains fewer
and simpler definitions; and

propose, in accordance with current legislative drafting practice, that most definitions will be contained in a
dictionary at the end of Division 2 of Part VIII of the Customs Act.

As you will note, the legislative guidelines outline only the nature of the legislative amendments envisaged; they
do not outline the proposed wording of the amendments.

The amendments are not designed to change the intent or the coverage of the existing valuation legislation.

At this stage, it is planned to introduce a Bill into the Parliament during the 2002 Spring program.

At this stage, it is planned to introduce a Bill into the Parliament during the 2002 Spring program.

Any comments on the legislative guidelines should be sent to:

Mr JOHN ARNDELL
Director
Valuation and Origin Section
Australian Customs Service
Customs House
5 Constitution Avenue
CANBERRA CITY ACT 2601

or emailed to john.arndell@customs.gov.au. The closing date for comments is Friday, 19 April 2002.

Exemption of Certain Goods from the Product Stewardship Oil (PSO) Levy

Following representations from industry, the Government has decided that certain goods will be exempt from the PSO Levy. The levy is applicable to goods described in a number of
tariff subheadings in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff) and, through the Excise Tariff Act 1921, to equivalent domestically produced goods. The levy is
presently $0.05363 per litre or kilogram.

The goods to be exempted are:

Certain food grade white mineral oils;

Certain aromatic process oils; and

Certain polyglycol brake fluids.

In order to give effect to the Government's decision, Customs Tariff Notice No. 1 (2002) will be published in a Special Gazette on Friday 12 April 2002.

The Notice will take effect on and from 15 April 2002 and will create two new items (72A and 72B) in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff along with three new by-laws
(By-laws Nos. 0240004, 0240005 and 0240006) that detail the particular goods to be exempted from the levy (Attachment A refers).

These items will operate through treatment codes 472 and 572 respectively. Users of the items will need to comply with the relevant by-laws and usage will be monitored by the
Australian Customs Service.

Equivalent changes will be made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and will be notified at the same time.

Item 50 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff has been restructured (see Attachment A) to accommodate the different treatment of goods classified under heading 3819.00.00 (hydraulic
transmission fluids) that are covered by a Tariff Concession Order, and other goods covered by a Tariff Concession Order. Item 50B, which currently caters for the goods of 3819.00.00 is
being repealed. Provision has been made within the restructured item 50 to cater for any hydraulic transmission fluids that are exempted from the levy and also are subject to a Tariff
Concession Order. Minor consequential changes have been made to the Table in section 19 of the Customs Tariff and to the Table in item 44 of
Schedule 4.

Tariff pages to be issued in connection with these changes are:

Customs Tariff Act page 15 (R.11); Schedule 4/23 (R.5) and 4/37 (R.1); Schedule of Concessional Instruments Part 2/115 (R.5) and Part 2/117 (R.3).

New reporting requirements for export cargo

The Trade Modernisation Legislation will introduce a number of changes to the way export cargo is reported to
Customs.

It is proposed that from 1 July 2002, the new legislation will change the conditions for when an export entry is
required. These changes include:

the threshold for the reporting of an export entry will be aligned to $2000 per consignment, and
all goods that require a permit, regardless of the value of the goods, will be required to be reported to Customs
via an export entry.

In addition, there will be a new mandatory reporting requirement relating to three fields for exempt line cargo
reported on a manifest.

Alignment of export entry thresholds

Currently an export entry is required for goods exported via air and sea with a value of $500 or greater. The
export entry threshold is applied to each line or type of good within a consignment.

It is proposed that from 1 July 2002, the reporting threshold will be raised to $2000 per consignment. This will
align air and sea reporting thresholds with the current reporting threshold for postal consignments. The threshold
will apply to a consignment as a whole rather than to each line or type of good within a consignment.

For example, currently if a consignment consists of 5 different types of goods, and the value of each good is
$450, an export entry is not required. However under the new legislation if a consignment consists of 5 different
types of goods, and the value each good is $450, bringing the consignment to a total value of $2250, an export
entry is required.

Customs considers a consignment to be goods that are shipped from one consignor (exporter) to one consignee
(importer), irrespective of whether the goods are in a single package or not (all packages should be taken to be
one consignment).

Goods requiring a permission

Currently goods that require a permit may be reported to Customs using an export entry or an exempt line,
dependent on the value of goods.

It is proposed that from 1 July 2002, all goods that require a permit will be required to be produced to Customs
using an export entry, regardless of the consignment value. It is important to note that it will no longer be possible
to quote a permit on an exempt cargo line.

These new permit reporting requirements are being implemented to assist Customs and Permit Issuing
Authorities in enforcing export controls.

Please note that if you require a Restricted Goods Permit (RGP) for the export of personal firearms you will now
also be required to make an export entry.

Exempt line reporting

Manifest reporters must report details of consignments that do not require an export entry to Customs on an
exempt cargo line.

It is proposed that from 1 July 2002, Customs will require the mandatory reporting of three fields for each exempt
cargo line. These fields are: Exporter Name, Country of Destination and Goods Description.

Enhanced Project By Law Scheme (item 71) - guidelines

The Enhanced Project By-Law Scheme (EPBS) (Item 71) replaces the existing Project By-Laws Scheme (Items
45, 46 and 56) and comes into effect on 1 July 2002.

Item 71 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 underpins the EPBS and covers:

""Goods, including machinery, equipment, or their components, as prescribed by by-law:

1. entered for home consumption on or after 1 July 2002; and
2. for use in any of the following industries:

a. mining;
b. resource processing;
c. agriculture;
d. food processing;
e. food packaging;
f. manufacturing (within the meaning of the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification

(ANZSIC));
g. gas supply.""

The EPBS provides an avenue for duty concessions in certain circumstances for imported eligible goods
(including machinery, equipment and their components) for projects in eligible industries where the total value of
eligible goods to be used in the project is $10 million or greater.

An Australian Industry Participation Plan (AIP Plan) is a new and important part of the EPBS and forms part of the
project acceptance application. The AIP Plan supports the principles of the national Australian Industry
Participation Framework. Further information about the AIP Plan can be found at www.customs.gov.au.

Depot licence application changes - 100 point check

Customs is implementing revised arrangements in relation to the depot licensing application process. The Customs Act 1901 states the Chief Executive Officer of Customs (the CEO)
must not grant a depot licence to a person, partnership or company where, in the CEO's opinion, the person, a partner, or a director, officer or shareholder of the company is not ""fit and
proper"" to hold that licence. The Customs Act also outlines the matters, which should be taken into consideration when making that determination.

The Depot Licence Application Form requests information about persons nominated as directors, shareholders or employees who will participate in the management and/or control of the
depot. The applicant/licensee is advised that such persons will be the subject of a police records check. Only those people nominated by the applicant/licencee as being involved in the
management and/or control of the depot are subject to these checks.

Under the new arrangements being implemented, those people nominated as being involved in the management and/or control of the depot will be required to establish their identity by
providing certified copies of any combination of the following documents which total 100 points or more:

Passport

Birth certificate

Drivers licence

Tariff advice review process

As a part of broader measures to improve business practices within the Tariff Branch and to ensure that clients
receive a quality service, Customs has undertaken an examination of the tariff advice review process. The revised
procedures provide for greater certainty and speedy resolution of disputes. They align with those in use by many
overseas Customs administrations.

The revised tariff advice review process is set out below.

Where an applicant for a tariff advice is dissatisfied with the decision given by Customs, the applicant may
request that the decision be reviewed by the Director, Tariff Classification in Canberra. This will be the only tariff
advice review conducted by Customs.

An application for a tariff advice review must be in writing and fully address the reasons why the decision is
disputed, together with reasons in support of the applicant's classification, including any information not
previously provided with the initial tariff advice application. Persons seeking a tariff advice review must also
supply high quality illustrated descriptive material and, if practical, a sample of the goods under dispute.

Requests for an internal review of a tariff advice should be addressed to:

The Director

The new review process will commence from 1 July 2002. Until this time, existing review arrangements outlined in

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION 
TRADE MARKS ACT 1995 

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under section 132 of 
the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule 
which have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade 
mark/s.  Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force for a period of two years 
from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark. 

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods 
prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations, while the reference to goods 
indicates to which goods the trade mark registration relates.  Prospective importers of such 
goods should seek further advice regarding the ambit of the Notice of Objection from their 
local Customs office. 

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported 
with a sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade 
mark, they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, 
etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade 
mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not 
infringed where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the 
consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied 
by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trademark and the goods are imported 
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still 
represent an infringement. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the 
provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a 
suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and 
the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an 
infringement of"" a trade mark.

Split consignments Item 70 of schedule 4 to the Customs

Tariff Act 1995

Item 70 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff) becomes effective from 1 July 2002 and
replaces current items 43 and 52. In general terms item 70 applies to machinery and equipment classified in
Chapter 84, 85, 86, 87, 89 or 90, which is not imported into Australia as a single consignment on the same
vessel. It is designed to overcome situations where the duty rates on the components of the complete machine
imported separately would be higher than the rate applicable to the goods if imported as a complete unit.

Eligibility criteria

To be eligible for a concession under item 70 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff, importers must demonstrate
that the goods to be imported:

1. satisfy the specific terms of item 70; and
2. meet the terms and conditions set out in Standing By-Law No. 0240007, which is linked to item 70.

The goods must be available as an identifiable whole good at the place of manufacture or export and must have
been ordered from and shipped to Australia by the same supplier. The concession does not apply to generic or
notional entities such as complete plant, greenfield or civil engineering projects.

Concessional entry of goods under item 70 is only available for completed goods in situations where it is not
practical for importers to transport the goods in one consignment due to size or sensitivity of parts or inadvertent
delay in transport

NOTE: Item 70 does not apply to replacement parts, components or spares used in modernising or refurbishing
existing machinery or equipment. Initial spare parts, maintenance tools and the like that may be supplied as part
of an original shipment do not constitute original components.

Administration

Concessional entry under item 70 is administered by Customs. Customs Regional Offices at the port of entry will
determine requests for concessional entry under item 70. Responsibility for Government industry policy rests with
the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources (ITR).

Compliance

Under Customs self-assessment system for reporting imported goods, the owner of the imported goods is
responsible for correctly describing goods in an import entry (including claiming the application of a concessional
item in Schedule 4 to the Tariff). The owner of the goods is also required to keep all commercial documents
relating to the goods and their carriage to Australia that come into the owner's possession for a period of 5 years
from the time the goods are entered for home consumption. Customs may need access to these documents to
check the accuracy of the entry details as part of its compliance assurance activities.

A copy of item 70 and standing By-law 0240007 made for the purposes of item 70 are available on the Customs
website at www.customs.gov.au. Further questions concerning this ACN should be directed to the Manager, Tariff
Concessions By-Laws, Tariff Branch on (02) 6275 6571 or facsimile (02) 6275 6376.

Information about item 70 policy and the Government objectives may be obtained from the Customs Policy

Provision of AHECC Advice

The Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) is the document used to classify goods for
export from Australia. For some time now Customs has been providing information about AHECC classification to
exporters and more recently has taken measures to provide formal advice.

On 1 July 2002 Customs will introduce an AHECC classification advisory service. The service, which will be
accessible primarily over the Internet, has been developed to provide timely and reliable advice for clients who
require assistance with the classification of goods for export. The service will be provided centrally through
Customs Sydney Office.

The process for obtaining AHECC advice will be as follows:

An ""Application For AHECC-Exports Advice"" form will be available on the Customs Internet site from 1 July
2002. Clients requiring AHECC advice should download this form, complete it and email it
to aheccadvice@customs.gov.au.

The form will indicate that any samples and/or supporting information relating to the application should be sent
to:

Manager Tariff and Valuation Customs House Sydney Central Building 477 Pitt Street SYDNEY NSW 2000

Samples may be delivered in person or by post. Supporting documentation may be provided to Customs by fax,
email, post or delivery to the Tariff Counter, during business hours, in the main Customs Office in the applicant's
State/Territory. The samples will be returned after the AHECC advice has been provided.

Customs will provide the requested advice to the applicant by return email.

If clients are unable to access email or Internet facilities they should ring the Customs Information Centre
(CIC) and ask to have a copy of the form faxed or mailed to them. The applicant should fax or mail the
completed form to the Manager Tariff and Valuation using the contact details listed above. Advice will then be
sent to the applicant's choice of fax or postal address.

The service standard for completing requests for AHECC advice will be five working days from receipt of all
relevant information including supporting documentation and samples where appropriate. Complex
classifications may take longer, and clients will be notified if this situation applies to them.

Customs will continue to provide general information about importing and exporting goods through regional
offices. However, AHECC advice specific to particular exports will only be issued in the manner outlined above.

Any questions in relation to this notice should be directed to Director Tariff Classification on (02) 6275 6273.

Customs fraud control policy

Fraud is the most expensive category of crime in Australia.

The Commonwealth Government is committed to protecting public revenue, expenditure, property, rights and
privileges from fraudulent exploitation. It's Fraud Control Policy is designed to ensure that fraud against the
Commonwealth is minimised and that, where it does occur, it is rapidly detected, and dealt with appropriately.

The Government determined that primary responsibility for fraud control rests with each Commonwealth agency.
The Australian Customs Service has recently issued a statement on its fraud control policy to all employees, and
elements are reproduced in this Customs Notice for the information of industry representatives, the public,
customs brokers, importers and exporters.

Definition of fraud

Fraud is not restricted to monetary or material benefits. In the Customs Fraud Control Policy fraud is defined, very
broadly, as:

""Inducing a course of action by deceit or other dishonest conduct, involving acts or omissions or the making of
false statements, orally or in writing, with the object of obtaining money or other benefit from, or of evading a
liability to, the Commonwealth.""

The definition of fraud was made even broader in the updated Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines
approved by Cabinet in May 2002. Fraud is now defined as:

""Dishonestly obtaining a benefit by deception or other means.""

The benefit involved can be either tangible or intangible. Examples of fraud include:

evasion of payments (eg, Customs duty);

obtaining benefits by deceit (eg, false claims for import credit scheme, tariff concession orders and tourist
refund scheme, and unlawful movement of goods through airports/ports);

abuse of Customs facilities (eg, unlawful use of laptop computers, vehicles, telephones, credit or fuel cards);

making, using or possessing forged or falsified documents;

bribery, corruption or abuse of office (eg, unlawful disclosure of information or hacking into, or interfering with a
Customs computer system);

theft of Customs' property;

causing a loss, or avoiding or creating a liability by deception (eg, charging Customs for non-delivery or
incomplete delivery of services); and

providing false or misleading information, or failing to provide information where there is an obligation to do so.

The policy

Customs will ensure that systematic and comprehensive fraud prevention and control arrangements are in place
to minimise exposure to fraud in line with the requirements of the Fraud Control Policy of the Commonwealth.

Policy principles

Policy principles include:

adoption of a risk-management approach to fraud;

prevention, detection and prompt investigation of fraud;

New valuation advice service

As a part of broader measures to improve business practices within the Tariff Branch and to ensure that clients
receive quality service, the Australian Customs Service (Customs) has reviewed and revised its procedures for
providing valuation advice.

The revised procedures, set out below, will provide for greater certainty and for speedy resolution of disputes.

Valuation advice

All valuation advices will be issued by the Customs Valuation Section in Melbourne.

An application for a valuation advice can be lodged electronically, through the TAPIN computer system, which is
available to importers/brokers in all States/ Territories. Alternatively, an application for a valuation advice can be
lodged manually, by completing a Valuation Advice Application (Form B174) and sending the application to the
following address:

Imports/Exports Branch
Australian Customs Service
414 Latrobe Street
GPO Box 2809AA
MELBOURNE VIC 3001

Applications may also be lodged with the Customs Tariff Section in each State or Territory. Those applications will

Cheese and curd tariff quota - allocations for 2002-2003

The Australian Customs Service (Customs) will shortly be advising importers of their allocation of cheese and
curd quota for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003.

Allocations have been based on the actual usage of quota in the 23 months ending

31 May 2002, as shown in Customs records of clearances for home consumption. The 23-month period has been
chosen to reflect the most recent usage of quota.

The calculation of an importer's quota entitlement excludes any quota transferred to another importer during the
23-month period or unused as at 31 May 2002.

Importers are reminded that quota is allocated for a particular financial year and that to use their quota allocation
they are required to 'enter for home consumption' the cheese or curd by the end of the financial year to which the
allocation relates, ie by 30 June of that year.

The cheese or curd is 'entered for home consumption' if:

1. an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs; and
2. the vessel or aircraft carrying the goods has arrived at the first Australian port or airport at which any cargo is

intended to be discharged.

If both conditions are not met by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, the goods are taken
to have been 'entered for home consumption' in the following financial year.

In such circumstances, the goods can be entered:

under quota for that financial year (if the importer has sufficient quota for that year); or
without quota at the rate of customs duty applicable to the relevant subheading of Schedule 3 of the Customs
Tariff Act 1995.

Quota allocations are transferable between importers. An application to transfer quota entitlements may be made
by completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) and submitting it to:

Director Tariff Concessions
Australian Customs Service
Customs House
5 Constitution Avenue
CANBERRA CITY ACT 2601

Applicants are reminded that transfer applications are dealt with strictly in order of receipt and may take up to four
working days to process. This processing time is suspended when it is necessary to return an incomplete or
incorrect application, and resumes when the application is returned. Applications should be submitted well in
advance of intended use.

Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form B235 is now available on the internet
website www.customs.gov.au. Further information on the Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme may be obtained from
Ninia Benedictos by telephoning (02) 6275 6483.

Trade modernisation changes for importers and exporters

On 1 July 2002 new Customs legislation to modernise trade will come into effect.

The legislation underpins Customs Cargo Management Re-engineering (CMR) program.

Importers and exporters may need to adjust their business practices, however several of the 1 July changes will
specifically affect exporters.

Industry will need to be aware of the requirements relating to commercial document/record retention and the new
infringement notice scheme.

Changes for exporters will include:

All goods for export will now be subject to Customs control from the time they arrive at the wharf, airport or
Customs depot.

Export entries will be required for consignments valued over $2000 and for all goods requiring a permit
regardless of value.

It will be mandatory to report three fields of data on a sub manifest or outward manifest for all goods that are
exempt from export entry requirements; exporter's name, country of destination and goods description.

With the consent of the occupier of the premises Customs can examine export goods and related documents
before they reach a Customs controlled place.

All those in the trading community should also note that:

Any person who causes goods to be exported or imported such as importers, exporters, cargo handlers and
cargo carriers must keep commercial documents for five years.

Communicators of information to Customs, such as Customs brokers and bureaus must keep records verifying
the information communicated to Customs for one year.

An infringement notice scheme will be introduced on 1 July for dealing with non-compliance.

Under the new scheme Customs has the option of issuing an infringement notice but is under no obligation to do
so for every offence. Before issuing a notice Customs will look at a person's overall compliance performance to
determine the best way to deal with a matter.

Notices could be issued from 1 July 2002 for the following offences:

Moving, altering or interfering with goods subject to Customs control without authority; and

Making false or misleading statements resulting in loss of duty.

Notices could be issued from 1 January 2003 for the following offences:

Making false or misleading statements not resulting in loss of duty; and

Owners failing to enter goods for export or allowing goods to be loaded on to an exporting ship or aircraft
without an authority to deal.

Further changes will occur as the new Customs computer system, the Integrated Cargo System (ICS), replaces
the existing reporting systems over the next two years - exports in November 2003, imports in March 2004.

Information packs containing fact sheets on all the changes have been sent out to all Australian Customs Notice
subscribers. If you have not received your pack you may wish to check your ACN mailing and contact details are

Updates to the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity

Classification (AHECC) 1 July 2002

The 2002 edition of the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) became operative on 1
January 2002. This edition incorporated extensive changes arising from the review, by the World Customs
Organization, of the international Harmonized System 6-digit categories.

The AHECC is compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and is designed for use by exporters,
customs brokers and freight forwarders for the classification of goods when providing export entries to the
Australian Customs Service, and to assist users in the interpretation of export statistics published by the ABS.

Details of the changes were outlined in Australian Customs Notice No. 2001/71. In that Notice, users were
advised that the 1 January 2002 edition of the AHECC would be the final version issued in printed form. Future
replacement pages to update the classification and explanatory notes, normally issued six monthly, and
subsequent new editions would be released electronically.

The ABS has finalised the changes required for the 1 July 2002 AHECC updates. These changes affect the
Introduction, Explanatory Notes, Abbreviations, AHECC Summary, and some codes in Chapters 17, 27, 28, 29
and 48.

The 1 July 2002 updates of the AHECC classification are now available from the ABS website free of charge.
Current copies of the AHECC manual can be updated by printing the replacement pages and including them in
the manual. In addition, a completely updated electronic version of the AHECC is available on the ABS website.

To access these documents, go to the ABS website www.abs.gov.au then select Themes, International Trade,
AHECC. To download the AHECC replacement pages, select AHECC replacement pages - 1 July 2002. From the
AHECC page users can also access the complete manual by selecting AHECC.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (2002) - Amended duty rates

for certain beer

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (2002) was tabled cognately with Excise Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2002) in the House
of Representatives on 26 June 2002. These proposals introduce new rates of customs and excise duty for certain
beer effective from 1 July 2002.

The new rates give effect to the Government's decision to implement a national excise scheme for low-alcohol
beer. The key feature of this scheme is the cessation of State subsidies for low-alcohol beer, with assistance now
to be delivered through lower customs and excise rates.

The rate of excise and customs duty for beer packaged in individual containers exceeding 48 litres has been
reduced from $16.46 to $5.69 per litre of alcohol for low-alcohol beer with less than three per cent alcohol by
volume. The rate of excise and customs duty for beer packaged in individual containers not exceeding 48 litres
has been reduced from $45.46 to $28.49 per litre of alcohol for low-alcohol beer and from $38.59 to $33.22 per
litre of alcohol for mid-strength beer with less than 3.5 per cent alcohol by volume. In each case, the excise and
customs rates of duty are calculated on that alcohol content over 1.15 per cent. All other duty rates for beer are
unchanged.

The following Customs Tariff reprint pages to reflect these changes will be issued in the week commencing 8 July
2002:

Schedule 3: Chapter 22/7 (R.14), 22/9 (R.14), 22/19 (R.6) and 22/21 (R.5).

Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002

Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002 - Act No. 38 of 2002 - received the Royal Assent on 26 June 2002.
This Act contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff), as follows:

The insertion of subsection 7(3) into the Tariff to specify that a reference in the Interpretation Rules to ""Notes""
includes a reference to ""Additional Notes"". Additional Notes are inserted into the Tariff to clarify the
classification of goods and to provide definitions for Australian domestic purposes. This amendment clarifies
the intent that Additional Notes have the same force as the international Section and Chapter Notes.

The insertion of a new Additional Note into Chapter 21 of the Tariff to specify that ""salsas"", a kind of sauce, are
to be classified in heading 2103 with other sauces. This Additional Note will ensure that Australia's treatment
of these goods is consistent with international practice.

The insertion of a post-2005 phasing rate of duty for item 59 in Part III of Schedule 4 of the Tariff. Item 59
provides for the importation of used or secondhand passenger motor vehicles without the payment of the
penalty rate of duty of $12,000, subject to Departmental by-laws. The post-2005 phasing rate of duty for item
59 was omitted in error from the Customs Tariff Amendment (ACIS Implementation) Act 1999.

The above changes commence on 10 July 2002.

The remaining amendments in Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002 correct errors that were contained
in Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 5) 2001, which also amended the Tariff. That Act gave effect to
approximately 800 changes to the Tariff resulting from the second review of the Harmonized System by the World
Customs Organization, effective from 1 January 2002.

One of these amendments corrects the duty rate for tariff subheading 4203.21.10, which applies to mittens and
mitts lined with furskin and used for sporting purposes. Following a re-examination of the classification of these
goods in the Tariff prior to 1 January 2002, a rate of duty of 5 per cent has been applied to this subheading from
that date to reflect the rate previously applicable to these goods.

The remaining amendments in Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002 are of an editorial nature and include
the correction of spelling, punctuation and the amendment of text to clarify the coverage of headings and
subheadings.

The following Tariff reprint pages to reflect these changes will be issued in the week commencing 15 July 2002:

Customs Tariff Act page 9 (R.2);

Schedule 3: 21/1 (R.1), 27/1 (R.3), 42/5 (R.4), 48/9 (R.5), 48/11 (R.3), 48/13 (R.5), 48/15 (R.5) 48/31 (R.1) and

Reporting requirements for exempt line cargo

The introduction of new export entry thresholds on 1 July 2002 has highlighted some improper reporting practices
for certain cargo exempt from entry requirements. This Notice outlines the correct reporting requirements for
certain cargo that does not have to be entered (exempt line cargo).

Background

With the introduction of the first phase of Cargo Management Re-engineering on 1 July 2002, Customs has
aligned the export entry threshold to $2000 FOB per consignment. This will decrease the number of export
entries required to be made and in turn increase the number of exempt lines to be reported in the outwards
manifest and/or the submanifest.

There has been a practice in some industry sectors to report the agent as the shipper and receiver and the
description of goods as 'consol' on export documentation for single line exempt consignments. While this practice
suits certain commercial purposes, these are not the details required to be communicated to Customs in the
outwards manifest and/or submanifest in respect of exempt line cargo.

Reporting obligations

Customs requires the following information in relation to exempt line cargo: actual Australian exporter's name,
country of destination and description of the goods. There are three options for reporting these details to
Customs:

1. By including them on the outwards manifest (in order to achieve this the details must be included in the master

air waybill);

2. By creating a sub manifest (CRN - Customs Reference Number) and reporting the CRN to the carrier;
3. By creating an export entry (ECN - Export Clearance Number), and reporting the ECN to the carrier.
The carrier will then report the information to Customs on the outward manifest.

Co-loading

Companies involved in co-loading must also provide the three data elements, which can be reported by the
methods stated above.

If you have concerns about maintaining client confidentiality and you do not wish to disclose commercial
information to your co-loaders, you may provide the reporting agent with a CRN.

Interim arrangements

Key industry groups have been co-operating with Customs to achieve compliance in this area.

As a result of this consultation, Customs has agreed to allow a transitional period until 1 September 2002, for
industry to adjust to Customs increased focus in this area.

Clients should promptly undertake action that will enable them to achieve accurate reporting prior to this date to
ensure minimal impact on the future export of goods.

Commerce markings on imported goods

General

Customs administers the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 (the Act) and the subordinate Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940 that set out the requirements for labelling on
goods imported into Australia. This Notice is intended to clarify the current operation of this legislation in relation to imported goods that require labelling. The Act and regulations are
being reviewed under Competition Principles Agreement and any changes arising from the review will be promulgated separately.

Legislation

Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905

A trade description in relation to any goods, means any description, statement, indication or suggestion, direct or indirect

1. as to the nature, number, quantity, quality, purity, class, grade, measure, gauge, size, or weight of the goods; or
2. as to the country or place in or at which the goods were made or produced; or
3. as to the manufacturer or producer of the goods or the person by whom they were selected, packed, or in any way prepared for the market; or
4. as to the mode of manufacturing, producing, selecting, packing, or otherwise preparing the goods; or
5. as to the material or ingredients of which the goods are composed, or from which they are derived; or
6. as to the goods being the subject of an existing patent, privilege, or copyright.

A false trade description means a trade description which, by reason of anything contained therein or omitted therefrom, is false or likely to mislead in a material respect as regards the
goods to which it is applied, and includes every alteration of a trade description, whether by way of addition, effacement, or otherwise, which makes the description false or likely to
mislead in a material respect.

The Act prohibits the import or export of goods bearing a false trade description, or not bearing a prescribed trade description. The Commerce (Imports) Regulations prescribe the
required trade description for imported goods. There are currently no prescribed trade descriptions for exported goods.

Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940

The regulations set out the labelling requirements for goods imported into Australia. Regulation 7(1)(a) to (s) lists the goods that are required to be marked with a trade description.
These goods are required to be marked with the name of the country in which the goods were made or produced and in some circumstances with a true description. The term ""true
description"" is not defined in the Act or Regulations. Advice on what constitutes a true description will vary according to the goods being imported. However, a general guide is to provide
a factual description that will help inform the consumer about the goods. For example, a description of 100% leather on a leather wallet. Current policy on the markings required for
goods listed in Regulation 7(1)(a) to (s) is expanded in the section headed ""Goods requiring labelling"" below.

The trade description must be:

in the English language,

in prominent and legible characters, and

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION 
TRADE MARKS ACT 1995 

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under section 132 of 
the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule 
which have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade 
mark/s.  Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force for a period of two years 
from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark. 

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods 
prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations, while the reference to goods 
indicates to which goods the trade mark registration relates.  Prospective importers of such 
goods should seek further advice regarding the ambit of the Notice of Objection from their 
local Customs office. 

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported 
with a sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade 
mark, they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, 
etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade 
mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not 
infringed where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the 
consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied 
by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trademark and the goods are imported 
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still 
represent an infringement. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the 
provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a 
suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and 
the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an 
infringement of"" a trade mark.

Indexation of Certain Excise and Customs Tariff Duty Rates – August 2002 

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the 
Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer 
(except “home brew”), tobacco, petroleum based oils and greases and their synthetic 
equivalents increased on 1 August 2002.  The new rates are set out in Tables 1 and 2 
of the Attachment to this Notice. 

The new rates of excise and customs duty listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment 
are calculated by multiplying the current rates by an indexation factor.  This factor has 
been calculated by dividing the most recent index number by the previous highest 
December or June index number.  Accordingly, the June 2002 index number (137.6) 
has been divided by the December 2001 number (135.4) to establish an indexation 
factor of 1.016.  As this factor is more than one, current rates of excise and customs 
duty will be increased by this factor. 

As rates of excise and customs duty relating to petroleum fuels have not been 
adjusted, no amendment to the rates of diesel fuel rebate is necessary.

Changes to the duty drawback scheme - procedural 

requirements for imputation method calculations 

DISCLAIMER 
The information provided in this Australian Customs Notice is no longer current and has been replaced 
by Australian Customs Notice No. 2019/41. 

A review of the imputation method of claiming drawback of duty has now been completed following a number of 
representations on the administrative procedures associated with this method of calculation. This has resulted in 
the adoption by Customs of a number of changes in the way drawback claims lodged under this method are to be 
processed. 

The imputation method is one of the three main methods under the drawback scheme that can be used by 
claimants for the calculation of the appropriate amount of duty drawback payable. The other two are the 
shipment-by-shipment method and the representative shipment method. The imputation method is also referred 
to as Method C on the Drawback Claim Form (B807). 

The imputation method is restricted to fully imported goods purchased in Australia by the exporter. The method 
provides a means by which drawback of duty can be claimed by exporters who cannot access the original import 
documentation in relation to imported goods purchased from an Australian supplier and who consequently are 
unaware of the actual import duty originally paid. Current procedures require a declaration from the supplier of the 
goods and the use of the imputation formula, as provided in Customs Regulation 135(2), to calculate the amount 
of the claim. 

To meet the needs of the contemporary user of the drawback scheme the requirement to provide Customs with 
a declaration from the supplier for all imputation method drawback claims is now removed. 

It is the claimant's responsibility to maintain records to substantiate entitlements under the drawback scheme and 
to produce those records to Customs if called upon to do so. With the removal of the requirement to provide a 
supplier's declaration in each instance Customs expects claimants to hold evidence that the goods the subject of 
the claim were imported and that duty was paid. 

If this evidence is not sufficient to identify the actual rate of duty applicable, to use in the imputation formula, 
Customs will accept the rate of duty that was in place six months prior to the date of the local purchase. 

Claimants are encouraged to discuss any aspects of these new arrangements with their local drawback officers or 
enquiries could be directed to Ron Houston, Supervisor Drawbacks, Canberra on telephone (02) 6275 6504, 
facsimile (02) 6275 6601 or at email ron.houston@customs.gov.au.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2002) - Ethanol

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2002) was tabled in Parliament on 16 September 2002. The Proposal increases
the rate of duty on denatured ethyl alcohol (ethanol) for use as fuel in internal combustion engines.

The additional duty is equal to that currently applying to petrol (38.143 cents per litre).

The Prime Minister announced these measures on 12 September 2002 in his media release entitled ""Government
Promotes Renewable Energy"". These changes reflect the Government's view that Australia should move towards
increased use of biofuels.

The Proposal creates a new tariff subheading 2207.20.10 to separately identify ethanol for use as fuel in internal
combustion engines. The new Customs rates of duty will be the existing rates (5 per cent General) plus 38.143
cents per litre. Other denatured ethyl alcohol will be classified in tariff subheading 2207.20.90 and retain the duty
rates of the former 2207.20.00 (5 per cent General).

Equivalent changes are also being made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921.

The changes take effect on and from 18 September 2002.

The following Tariff reprint pages to reflect the changes will be issued in the week commencing 23 September
2002:

Schedule 3: Chapter 22/17 (R.7); and
Schedule 4/21 (R.5).

Any queries relating to Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2002) should be directed to Manager, Tariff Legislation and

NOTICES OF OBJECTION TO IMPORTATION 
TRADE MARKS ACT 1995 

The companies referred to in the attached Schedule have given notice under section 132 of 
the Trade Marks Act 1995 objecting to the importation of the goods listed in the Schedule 
which have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign which infringes the relevant trade 
mark/s.  Unless revoked, these Notices of Objection remain in force for a period of two years 
from the commencement date shown for the particular trade mark. 

The references in the Schedule to particular classes of goods refer to the classes of goods 
prescribed in Schedule 1 in the Trade Marks Regulations, while the reference to goods 
indicates to which goods the trade mark registration relates.  Prospective importers of such 
goods should seek further advice regarding the ambit of the Notice of Objection from their 
local Customs office. 

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside Australia and are imported 
with a sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the relevant trade 
mark, they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, 
etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade 
mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not 
infringed where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the 
consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied 
by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trademark and the goods are imported 
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still 
represent an infringement. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the 
provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a 
suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and

Inclusion of warranty in Customs value

The valuation provisions in Division 2 of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) have been amended to
provide consistency with Article 1 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on
Tariff and Trade 1994 (the Valuation Agreement). The changes were implemented through Customs Legislation
Amendment Act (No 1) 2002 which received Royal Assent on 10 October 2002.

The amendments were necessary after the Full Court of the Federal Court ruled, on 19 September 2000, that
warranty costs were a ""value unrelated matter"" and should not be included in the customs value of imported
goods. The Government considers that this decision interpreted the valuation provisions of the Customs Act in a
manner that was inconsistent with the Valuation Agreement.

The effect of the amendments is that all payments by the buyer of the imported goods to the seller, including any
payments for warranty, are to be included in the customs value of all goods entered for home consumption on or
after 10 October 2002. While there is now no specific mention in the Customs Act of activities undertaken by the
purchaser on the purchaser's own account, it is clear from the Valuation Agreement that any costs, charges or
expenses in relation to these activities should not be added to the price of the goods when determining the
customs value.

All Valuation Advices (VAs) that have been issued indicating that warranty cost could be deducted from the price
of the imported goods as a value unrelated matter have been voided and owners of the VAs advised accordingly.
Anyone wishing to obtain a ruling on future importations may seek a fresh VA from Manager, Tariff and Valuation,
Australian Customs Service, Customs House, 414 La Trobe Street Melbourne VIC 3000 (GPO Box 2809AA
Melbourne VIC 3001).

Schedule 1 is a list of countries and places that receive a preferential rate of duty

Schedule 3 is the list of tariff classifications and applicable rates of duty

Updates to the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity

Classification (AHECC), 1 January 2003

The 2002 edition of the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) became operative on 1
January 2002. The AHECC is compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and is designed for use by
exporters, customs brokers and freight forwarders for the classification of goods when providing export
declarations to the Australian Customs Service, and to assist users in the interpretation of export statistics
published by the ABS.

Details of the 1 January 2002 release of the AHECC were outlined in Australian Customs Notice (ACN) No.
2001/71. In that notice, users were advised that the 1 January 2002 edition of the AHECC would be the final
version issued in printed form and that future replacement pages and subsequent new editions would be released
electronically.

The first electronic AHECC updates were made on 1 July 2002 as advised in ACN No. 2002/34. The ABS has
now finalised the changes required for the 1 January 2003 AHECC updates. These changes affect the
Introduction, Key of Changes, and some codes in Chapters 01, 51, 84, 85 and 98.

The 1 January 2003 updates will be available from the ABS website from 13 December 2002, free of charge.
Copies of the AHECC manual can be updated by printing the replacement pages and substituting them for the
relevant pages in the manual. In addition, a completely updated website version of the AHECC will be available
for online reference.

To access these documents, go to the ABS website www.abs.gov.au then select Themes, International Trade. To
download the AHECC replacement pages, select AHECC. This page provides links to the 1 July 2002 and 1
January 2003 replacement pages, the manual as at 1 January 2002, and the updated website version as at 1
January 2003.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
and Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 - Kimberley 
process - rough diamonds 

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 were notified in Special 
Gazette No. S484 of 20 December 2002.   

United Nations General Assembly sanctions against the international trade in 
‘conflict diamonds’ 

By United Nations General Assembly Resolutions 55/56 of 1 December 2000 and 
Resolution 56/263 of 13 March 2002, the United Nations (UN) called for the 
introduction of an international certification scheme to restrict the trade in ‘conflict 
diamonds’.  Conflict diamonds are rough (uncut) diamonds mined without 
government approval and used to finance armed conflicts and the activities of rebel 
movements intended to undermine or overthrow legitimate governments. 

The UN resolutions resulted in the development of the Kimberley Process 
Certification Scheme for Rough Diamonds (the Kimberley Process) which covers 
rough diamonds that are unworked or simply sawn, cleaved or bruted and fall to 
classifications 7102.10, 7102.21 or 7102.31 of the Harmonised Commodity 
Description Classification System or Australian Harmonised Export Commodity 
Classification.  

On 5 November 2002 Australia - along with 36 other countries and the European 
Community, adopted the Kimberley Process under the Interlaken Declaration.  The 
attachment to this document provides a list of those countries that have adopted the 
Kimberley Process with effect from 1 January 2003.  It is important to note that the 
list of countries will change over time as more countries adopt the Kimberley Process.  
Customs understands that information on which countries have adopted the 
Kimberley Process will be available from the Kimberley Process Secretariat website 
(refer later in this document). 

Under the Kimberley Process Australia has undertaken to ensure that: 

• 

shipments of rough diamonds can neither be imported from nor exported to a 
country that has not adopted the Kimberley Process;

_____________________________________________________________________ 

Valuation of imported goods: treatment of fumigation costs 

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice is to advise on the treatment of 
fumigation costs when determining the customs value of imported goods. 

The customs value of imported goods includes any “price-related costs”. 

The term “price related costs” is defined in subsection 154(1) of the Customs Act 
1901 and includes packing costs for materials and labour paid or payable, directly or 
indirectly, by or on behalf of the purchaser in respect of the goods, including costs of 
fumigating, cleaning, coating, wrapping or otherwise preparing the goods for their 
exportation from a foreign country or otherwise placing them in the condition in 
which they are imported into Australia. 

It follows that the cost of fumigation should be included in the customs value of 
imported goods where: 

(a) 

(b) 

the cost is paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of the 
purchaser; and 
the fumigation is undertaken to prepare the goods for exportation or to place 
the goods in the condition in which the goods are imported. In other words, the 
fumigation occurs before the goods are imported into Australia. 

Any inquiries regarding this Notice should be directed to:

Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002 – changes to air 
cargo reporting 

The Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002 increases national security by 
further protecting Australia’s borders. 

The Act contains amendments that affect a range of Customs activities that contribute 
to the security of our borders, and includes new requirements that deal with the 
movement of goods. Specifically, the Act requires pilots and owners of aircraft to 
report to Customs 

• 
in-transit cargo and  
•  mail and airline mail. 

Customs has undertaken consultation with sections of industry during the past 
6 months to assist in the implementation of the new reporting arrangements. These 
reporting changes will begin on 5 January 2003. This Notice details requirements 
relevant to in-transit reporting and mail reporting in the air cargo environment. 

In-transit cargo 

In-transit air cargo is cargo intended to be kept on board an aircraft arriving from 
overseas while it is in Australia for shipment to an overseas airport. Currently, goods 
in transit through Australia are not required to be reported to Customs, as they are not 
intended to be unshipped in Australia. In implementing the new legislation, it is the 
Government’s intention that there be more effective border controls on in-transit 
cargo. 

Reporting in-transit cargo 

The Border Security Legislation Amendment Act amends section 64AB of the 
Customs Act to provide that, where an aircraft arrives at its first Australian airport 
after having called at any airport outside Australia, the pilot or owner of the aircraft 
must communicate to Customs a report of any cargo onboard that is intended to be 
kept on board for transportation to a place outside Australia. 

The in-transit report must be communicated to meet the following requirements:

Changes to the ATA (Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission) 
Carnet document 

The purpose of this Customs Notice is to advise of changes to the ATA carnet 
document that took effect on 18 December 2002. The amendments to the carnet 
document have been agreed by the Administrative Committees of the Customs 
Convention on the ATA Carnet for the Temporary Admission of Goods and the 
Customs Convention on Temporary Admission (the Istanbul Convention). 

Under agreed arrangements, there will be a two-year transition period during which 
both the current and new format carnets will be accepted by Customs administrations 
around the world. This transition period ends on 18 December 2004. After this date, 
only the new format ATA carnet will be valid.  

There are no changes to the eligibility criteria or the conditions under which goods 
are granted temporary admission into Australia. The changes do not remove the 
requirement for the carnet document and the goods covered by it to be presented to 
Customs for clearance into and out of each country. Nor do they affect the fields that 
need to be completed by the carnet holder before presenting the carnet to Customs. 
The changes to the format of the carnet include the following: 

•  The new document is A4 size. 

•  The countries that the carnet is valid in have been listed on the front cover.  

•  The counterfoils that are endorsed by Customs and remain in the carnet are 
grouped together at the front of the carnet. These counterfoils are clearly 
marked at the bottom of each page, ""Do not remove from the carnet"". 

•  The vouchers that are detached by Customs are now whole pages towards the 
back of the carnet. When detached, these pages are retained by Customs. 

CPDs (Carnet De Passage En Douane) issued under the Customs Convention on the 
Temporary Importation of Private Road Vehicles are not affected. 

Questions on the Customs clearance of goods on the new carnet may be directed to 
the Securities Section of Customs in the state of import or to Supervisor, Temporary 
Imports on 02 6275 6047, facsimile 02 6275 6699 or via e-mail at

Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002 – changes to sea 
cargo reporting 

The Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002 increases national security by 
further protecting Australia’s borders.  The Border Security Legislation Amendment 
Act amends the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act).  References in this ACN to 
legislative provisions are references to the Customs Act. 

The Border Security Legislation Amendment Act contains amendments that affect a 
range of Customs activities that contribute to the security of our borders, and includes 
new requirements that deal with the movement of goods.  Specifically, the Border 
Security Legislation Amendment Act will require masters and owners of ships to 
report in-transit cargo to Customs.  Customs has undertaken consultation with 
sections of industry during the past 6 months to assist in the implementation of the 
new reporting arrangements.  The relevant amendments will commence on 5 January 
2003, and masters and owners will be required to report all in-transit cargo from this 
date.  This notice details requirements relevant to in-transit reporting in the sea cargo 
environment. 

In-transit cargo 

In-transit sea cargo is cargo that is on board a ship that arrives in Australia that is 
intended to be kept on board the ship for shipment to a place outside Australia 
(including the external Territories) (s.64AB(3AA)). 

Reporting in-transit cargo 

The Border Security Legislation Amendment Act amends section 64AB of the 
Customs Act to provide that, where a ship arrives at its first Australian port after 
having called at any port outside Australia, the master or owner of the ship must 
communicate to Customs a report of all in-transit cargo on the vessel (s.64AB(3AA)). 

The in-transit report must be communicated to meet the following requirements: 

If a ship’s journey from the last port it called at outside Australia is likely to take 48 
hours or more, the report must be communicated to Customs not later than 48 hours 
before the ship’s arrival in Australia (s.64AB(3AA)(a)).  If the journey is likely to 
take less than 48 hours, the report must be provided not later than 24 hours before its 
arrival (s.64AB(3AA)(b)).

Goods and Services Tax: importation of goods into Australia

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has released a Draft Goods and Services Tax Ruling on the importation of goods into Australia (GSTR 2002/D11). The ruling is a draft for industry,
professional and community comment.

The draft ruling explains who is liable to pay GST on taxable importations, how GST is paid, who is entitled to claim input tax credits for creditable importations and addresses a number
of related issues.

The draft ruling outlines the ATO's view of GST law as it relates to various importing arrangements.

Because of its implications for current GST aspects of importing arrangements, importers and brokers are encouraged to read and consider the draft ruling. It can be accessed from the
ATO Internet site at http://law.taxreform.ato.gov.au.

Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 2002 - Act No. 114 of 2002 - received Royal Assent on 2 December 2002.
The Act amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) by enacting changes previously included in the following
Customs Tariff Proposals:

No. 1 (2002) - Provided exemptions for certain goods from the Product Stewardship Oil (PSO) Levy. These
amendments were first given effect in Customs Tariff Notice No. 1 (2002) - ACN 2002/16 refers; and

No. 2 (2002) - Implemented new duty rates for certain beer - ACN 2002/39 refers.

The above Tariff Amendment Act also amended section 19 of the Customs Tariff as a consequence of the
removal of indexation provisions for those goods subject to the PSO Levy.

Tariff reprint pages relevant to the above amendments were issued during 2002. Customs Tariff page 15 (R.12)
will be issued to reflect the amendment of section 19 of the Tariff.

Indexation of certain excise and customs tariff duty rates 
– February 2003 

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the 
Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer 
(except “home brew”) and tobacco increase on 1 February 2003.  The new rates are 
set out in Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment to this Notice. 

As a result of a Government decision the indexation of customs rates of duty for those 
goods subject to the Product Stewardship Oil Levy has ceased.  Relevant legislative 
amendments are contained in Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 2002. 

The new rates of excise and customs duty listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment 
are calculated by multiplying the current rates by an indexation factor.  This factor has 
been calculated by dividing the most recent index number by the previous highest 
December or June index number.  Accordingly, the December 2002 index number 
(139.5) has been divided by the June 2002 number (137.6) to establish an indexation 
factor of 1.014.  As this factor is more than one, current rates of excise and customs 
duty will be increased by this factor.

Notices of objection to importation - Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, 
the authorised user of a trademark to object to the importation of goods which 
infringe their trademark.  The registered owner, or authorised user does this by 
lodging a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  
Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two years 
from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have 
lodged Notices of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995.  The Notices notify 
the objections of these registered owners and authorised users to the importation of 
goods which infringe their trade mark or trade marks. Descriptions of the relevant 
trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a 
particular “class” of goods.  This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in 
Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a description of the 
goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is 
registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from 
Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into 
Australia: 

-  

have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical 
with, or deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

- 

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, 
lease, hire, etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a 
trade mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark

Amendments to Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. 
Introduction of controls on handguns for sports shooters and 
international sports shooters 

Following agreement at the 12th meeting (6 December 2002) of the Council of 
Australian Governments on new handgun controls, the Minister for Justice and 
Customs undertook to have new regulations and procedures for imported handguns in 
place by the end of December 2002. 

The legislative amendments vary the interpretation of a certified sports shooter and 
certified international sports shooter in Part 4 of the Regulations. Police certification 
for importations of Category H handguns for such persons is now subject to the 
handguns complying with the new restrictions on barrel length, calibre and capacity.  

Additionally, disposal (sales) to sporting shooters by firearms dealers will only be 
possible where the handgun complies with the new restrictions. 

An outline of the new regulations is as follows:  

The importation of handguns and handgun parts for the purposes of sports shooting 
will continue to operate under the police authorisation test. However, the definition of 
a “certified sports shooter” and a “certified international sports shooter” has been 
amended to ensure that these categories of importer are prohibited from importing 
Category H handguns, Category H handgun magazines and Category H handgun 
barrels that do not comply with the following specifications:  

    a calibre not greater than .38”, unless the handgun is required for participation 
in a specially accredited sporting event, in which case the calibre must not be 
greater than .45” 

    a barrel length of at least 120mm for a semi-automatic handgun and at least 

100mm for a revolver or a single-shot handgun, unless the handgun is a highly 
specialised target pistol; and 

    a shot capacity of not more than 10 rounds. 

Muzzle loading pistols and cap and ball percussion-fired revolvers manufactured after 
1 January 1900 are excluded from the new restrictions.  

Until an in-principle agreement is reached by the State and Territory Police Ministers 
on the specially accredited events, certified sports shooters and certified international 
sports shooters will be unable to import a handgun or barrel of a calibre that exceeds

Amendments to Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations

1956. Transitional arrangements relating to changes to the

controls on handguns for sports shooters and international

sports shooters

Regulation amendments of 20 December 2002 (outlined in Australian Customs Notice 2003/08) made
importations of handguns by sports shooters, and sales of imported handguns by dealers to sports shooters,
subject to restrictions on barrel length, calibre and capacity. The regulation amendment was in response to the
COAG resolutions to restrict high calibre and concealable handguns able to be imported into and possessed in
Australia.

Additional amending regulations with effect from 21 February 2003 ensure that, prior to implementation of the
complementary State and Territory legislation, Australian and international sports shooters competing in national
and international events are not disadvantaged.

The amending regulations enable Australian sports shooters to import handguns which they take overseas for the
purposes of competing in an international sports shooting event. The amendments also enable international
sports shooters who come to Australia to compete in sports shooting events to import certain handguns that they
might otherwise not be permitted to bring into Australia and which Australian sports shooter are currently
permitted to possess. International sports shooters would be required to export those handguns as soon as
practicable after the completion of the competition.

The amendments only apply in respect of international or Australian sports or target shooting events intended to
be held on or before 30 June 2003.

Further information regarding the amended Regulations may be obtained from:

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports)

Regulations 1958

Import of viable materials derived from human embryo clones

Export of human embryos

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and the Customs (Prohibited
Exports) Regulations 1958 were notified in Gazette No. S54 of 27 February 2003.

The Prohibition of Human Cloning Act 2002 (Human Cloning Act 2002), which came into effect on 16 January
2003, prohibits the importation and exportation of human embryo clones and prohibited embryos.

The Customs Prohibited Imports/Exports Regulations have been amended to support the introduction of the
Human Cloning Act 2002. Changes cover the following:

the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 have been amended to prohibit absolutely the importation
of living tissue and cells (viable material) derived from human embryo clones; and
the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 have been amended to prohibit absolutely the export of
human embryos for a period of 12 months.

The amendments to the Customs legislation adopt the definitions of 'human embryo' and 'human embryo clone'
from Section 8 of the Human Cloning Act 2002.

Consequential amendments to Schedule 1AA to the Customs Regulations 1926 also have been made to make
the prohibited goods constitute tier 2 goods under section 233BAB of the Customs Act 1901 with offences
attracting penalties up to $250,000 or 10 years imprisonment (or both).

The legislative authority for the amendments is Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 2003 (No.
1) - Statutory Rule 2003 No. 18, Customs (Prohibited Exports) Amendment Regulations 2003 (No. 1) - Statutory
Rule No.17 and Customs Amendment Regulations 2003 (No. 1) - Statutory Rule No. 16.

Notices Of Objection To Importation Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the 
authorised user of a trademark to object to the importation of goods which infringe their 
trademark.  The registered owner, or authorised user does this by lodging a Notice of 
Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice of 
Objection remains in force for a period of two years from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged 
Notices of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995.  The Notices notify the objections of 
these registered owners and authorised users to the importation of goods which infringe their 
trade mark or trade marks. Descriptions of the relevant trade marks are also set out in the 
Schedule. 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular 
“class” of goods.  This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade 
Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the 
type of goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  Prospective importers of 
such goods should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of 
Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into Australia: 

-  

have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, 
or deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

- 

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, 
etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade 
mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not 
infringed where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the 
consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied 
by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trademark and the goods are imported 
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still 
represent an infringement.

SEEKING SUBMISSIONS RELATING TO  
CUSTOMS ACCREDITED CLIENT PROGRAM 

The Australian Customs Service (Customs) is introducing an Accredited Client 
Program (ACP) under the provisions of the Customs Legislation Amendment and 
Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Bill 2001.  The program is designed to 
facilitate importers and exporters who have a proven record of compliance with 
Customs reporting requirements.   

The first stage of implementation of the ACP is expected to commence in December 
2003 with the introduction of the export reporting phase of Customs integrated cargo 
system. 

The Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison is convening a working group in 
Canberra on 6 May 2003.  This working group will discuss issues relating to the ACP. 

The issues for discussion include: 

Issue 1 - An extension of the ACP to formally recognise the role of ‘Service 
Providers’ such as Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders. 

Part 1 of the ACP Business Rules details the type of ‘person’ that can enter ACP.  At 
present there are no provisions for Service Providers entering the program in their own 
right.  They may act as an agent for an importer or exporter.  In doing so, they are 
required to enter into a formal contract and abide by the business rules underpinning 
the program. 

Issue 2 - The addition of a security component to the current ACP.   

This issue would involve a commitment by accredited clients to ensure their importing 
and exporting processes reflect the government’s position on supply chain security as 
part of its counter-terrorism initiatives.  It would entail a consideration to the extension of 
the program to include to Brokers, Freight Forwarders, Cargo Carriers and Handlers. 

Issue 3 - A review of the commencement audit costs to clients.  Feedback is 
sought on the potential high costs of undertaking the commencement audit in 
order to meet the assurance standards for participation in the program. 

Part 1 of the Business Rules requires a client to produce an audit report, compliance 
statement and working papers from an auditor, prepared in accordance with standards, 
which form part of the current Australian Auditing Standards series published by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants and CPA Australia’s.

The Proposal inserts a new Additional Note (Additional Note 2) to Chapter 29 of 
Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995. 

This Note allows the chemical “paraquat dichloride” with an added emetic for safety 
reasons to be classified in subheading 2933.39.00, which attracts a rate of duty of free. 

The insertion of this Note corrects an anomaly in the Tariff whereby paraquat

of five per cent. 

This change takes effect from 1 April 2003.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 - 
export of human embryos 

The following amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (the 
Prohibited Exports Regulations) was notified in Gazette No. S99 of 27 March 2003. 

On 27 February 2003, the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Amendment Regulations 2003 (No. 
1) inserted an absolute prohibition on the exportation of human embryos from Australia into 
the Prohibited Exports Regulations (regulation 7 refers).  Consequential amendments were 
also made to the export controls on certain human body fluids, organs and other tissue and 
Schedule 1AA of the Customs Regulations 1926. 

On 27 March 2003, the absolute prohibition was replaced with an arrangement that would 
allow the Minister for Justice and Customs to grant permission for human embryos to be 
exported from Australia in certain cases.  The Minister may give permission if he is satisfied 
that: 

the embryo that is going to be exported will, if necessary to achieve her pregnancy, be 
implanted in the woman for whom it was created or donated to; or 
the embryo is going to be exported for the purpose of being implanted in another woman 
in accordance with a certain type of agreement. 

The agreement can only be a commercial agreement if the agreement was made or the 
negotiations for the agreement were entered into prior to 27 March 2003.  An agreement will 
be a commercial agreement if it provides for any valuable consideration.  If negotiations for 
an agreement were entered into on or after 27 March 2003, the Minister may give permission 
only if the agreement is not a commercial agreement.  When applying for permission a copy 
of the agreement (or evidence of negotiations) must be provided.   

A number of statements must be provided to the Minister with an application for permission 
to export embryos.  The requirements relating to these statements can be found in 
regulation 7.  Regulation 7 also sets out who can apply for permission and defines many of 
the relevant terms.  A person who is granted permission will be required to advise Customs of 
their intended departure at least 24 hours prior to leaving Australia.  The person is to advise 
the Customs Office situated in the State from which they are departing Australia. 

The regulations will cease to have effect on 26 March 2004.  The legislative authority for the 
amendments is Customs (Prohibited Exports) Amendment Regulations 2003 (No 2) - 
Statutory Rule No 44.

posted in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of Monday 14 April 2003.  The following 
commodities are to be controlled as Items 9 and 10 respectively of Schedule 12 of Regulation 
4U of the Regulations: 

    Candles with wicks that contain greater than 0.06% lead by weight; and 
    Candle wicks containing greater than 0.06% lead by weight 

Regulation 4U prohibits the importation of goods subject to a permanent ban under the Trade 
Practices Act 1974 unless permission in writing has been granted by the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Treasurer.  The controls have been introduced in response to medical evidence that lead 
emissions from candles with lead wick cores pose an unacceptable health risk.   

The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the Hon Ian Campbell MP, published a consumer 
protection notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette on 30 October 2002 proclaiming a 
permanent ban on candles with lead wick cores.  The previous Minister responsible for 
Consumer Affairs, the Hon Joe Hockey MP, had signed unsafe goods notices for these goods on 
1 September 1999 and 19 March 2002.   

The legislative authority for the amendment is the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment 
Regulations 2003 (No.4) and is recorded in Statutory Rule 2003 No.54.

Container examination – cost recovery and operations 

Background 

New Customs container examination facilities (CEFs) are now in operation in 
Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, and will come into operation in Fremantle in 
November 2003. These facilities use container x-ray technology and will inspect 
around 80,000 containers per year in total, or around five per cent of total loaded 
import containers. This is now a standard part of the Customs clearance process.  

Costs and charges 

Government has decided that s.186 of the Customs Act applies to the logistics 
arrangements involved in the container examination initiative and has decided not to 
change its policy of cost recovery for these activities. As there is now a direct cost to 
Customs instead of previous indirect costs, different recovery arrangements will 
apply. 

On 16 April 2003, the Government approved an increase in the sea cargo Import 
Processing Charges (IPC). The increase in the IPC will not recover all logistics costs: 
the Government will fund around one-third of total logistics costs in 2003-04. 

New regulations have been made under the Import Processing Charges Act 1997 to 
increase the charges. 

There will be no increase on line charges. The new charges are as follows:  

Item 
Import Entry via 
sea (lodged 
electronically) 
Manual Import 
Entry charge via 
sea 

Current Charge 
$29.65 per entry 
plus $0.20 per line 
after line 10 
$51.40 per entry 
plus $1.00 per line 
after the first line 

Increase 
$14.35 

$14.35 

These new charges will operate from 1 May 2003. 

New Charge 
$44.00 per entry 
plus $0.20 per line 
after line 10 
$65.75 per entry 
plus $1.00 per line

Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Act 2002 

This Australian Customs Notice provides advice on the amendments to the 
Copyright Act 1968 (the Copyright Act) as they relate to the Notice of Objection 
regime administered by the Australian Customs Service.   

The Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Act 2002 (the Parallel 
Importation Act) made a number of amendments to the Copyright Act that are 
concerned with parallel importation of computer programs, and electronic literary 
and music items.  These amendments to the Copyright Act took effect on 15 April 
2003.   

“Parallel importation” is the importation of genuine products (non-pirated) outside 
of the copyright owner’s endorsed importation and distribution channels.  

The Amendments 
Customs administers a Notice of Objection regime under Division 7, Part V of the 
Copyright Act.  Amendments to the Copyright Act introduced in the Parallel 
Importation Act which affect the operation of this regime include: 
    defining electronic literary or music item (s.10(1)) 
    defining a non-infringing copy of a computer program (s.10AB) 
    defining a non-infringing copy of an electronic literary or music item 

(s.10AC) 

    defining when a computer program or electronic literary or music item is 

considered to be an accessory (s.10AD) 

    defining a feature film (s.10AD) 
    providing circumstances when the copyright in a computer program or 

electronic literary or music item is not infringed (s.44E, s.44F) 
    providing circumstances where a published edition of a work is not 

infringed (s.112DA) 

    excluding from border measures, copies of copyright material that do not 
constitute an infringement because of the operation of sections 44E, 44F 
or 112DA (s.135(10)) 

    addressing the treatment of goods covered by parallel importation 

provisions, where those goods bear a registered trademark (s.198A). 

These changes will allow the importation of genuine (non-pirated) computer 
programs (including games software), and electronic literary and music items 
without the permission of the copyright owner.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
and Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and 
the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 were notified in Special Gazette 
No. S116 of 14 April 2003. The amendments commenced on gazettal. 

United Nations Security Council – Termination of Sanctions Against Angola. 

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) imposed a number of sanctions against 
Angola under UNSC Resolutions 864 of 15 September 1993, 1127 of 28 August 1997 
and 1173 of 12 June 1998. Customs implemented Australia’s obligations to enforce 
these sanctions through Regulation 4M of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) 
Regulations 1956 and Regulations 13CE and 13CF of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) 
Regulations 1958. ACN Nos. 94/37, 98/04 and 99/51 refer. 

These sanctions included restrictions on the importation of unset diamonds from Angola 
or of Angolan origin, and the exportation of petroleum and petroleum products, aircraft 
and aircraft components, mining and transport equipment. 

On 9 December 2002 the UNSC adopted Resolution 1448 which terminated the 
sanctions against Angola. The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and 
Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 have been amended to give effect to 
this Resolution by Statutory Rules Nos. 53 and 52 respectively. 

Note:  The requirements of Regulation 4MA of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) 
Regulations 1956 and 9AA of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 must 
still be complied with in relation to the importation and exportation of rough diamonds, 
to and from Angola, under the Kimberley Process. 

Any enquiries on the policy supporting this change may be directed to the Department 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade on (02) 6261 1272. Any administrative questions on 
import and export issues may be directed to the Customs Information Centre on  
1300 363 263.

Notices of Objection to Importation under Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the 
authorised user of a trademark to object to the importation of goods which infringe their 
trademark.  The registered owner, or authorised user does this by lodging a Notice of 
Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice of 
Objection remains in force for a period of two years from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have 
lodged Notices of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995.  The Notices notify the 
objections of these registered owners and authorised users to the importation of goods 
which infringe their trade mark or trade marks. Descriptions of the relevant trade marks 
are also set out in the Schedule. 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular 
“class” of goods.  This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the 
Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a description of the goods, is used to 
describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  Prospective 
importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of 
any Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into Australia: 

-  

have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical 
with, or deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

- 

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, 
hire, etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark.

Notice of objection - Section 135 of the Copyright Act 1968 

The Copyright Act 1968 (the Copyright Act) allows the owner and exclusive licensee of 
the copyright in copyright material to object to the importation of infringing copies – 
that is, copies of copyright material that would have infringed their copyright had those 
copies been made in Australia by the importer.   

The owner or the exclusive licensee of the copyright does this by lodging a Notice of 
Objection under the Copyright Act with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  
Unless revoked or declared to be ineffective, a Notice of Objection remains in force for 
whichever is the shorter of the following two periods: 

(a)  

(b) 

the period of two years commencing from the date the Notice was given to 
Customs; or  
the period for which the copyright in the copyright material to which the Notice 
relates is to subsist. 

The attached Schedule sets out the copyright owners and exclusive licensees who have 
lodged a Notice of Objection, and a description of the copyright material in respect of 
which the copyright is owned or exclusively licensed.  The Notices notify the objections 
of the copyright owners and exclusive licensees to the importation of infringing copies.  

Customs may seize infringing copies to which a Notice of Objection that is in force 
applies while the copies are subject to the control of Customs if they were imported for: 
sale, lease for hire, or by way of trade offer or exposure for sale or hire; or 

- 
-  distribution for the purpose of trade; or 
-  distribution for any other purpose to an extent that will affect prejudicially the 
owner or exclusive licensee of the copyright in the copyright material; or 
exhibition in public by way of trade. 

- 

People intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of 
the Copyright Act should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably 
qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the Copyright Act.

CHEESE AND CURD TARIFF QUOTA – 
ALLOCATIONS FOR 2003-2004 

The Australian Customs Service (Customs) will shortly be advising importers of their 
allocation of cheese and curd quota for the period 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004. 

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of the quota by that 
importer in the 23-month period ending 31 May 2003, as shown in Customs’ records 
of clearances for home consumption.  The 23-month period has been chosen to reflect 
the most recent use of quota by importers. 

This calculation  excludes any part of the quota that was transferred to another 
importer during the 23-month period or that was unused as at 31 May 2003. 

Importers are reminded that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To 
use the quota allocated importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their 
imported cheese or curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation 
relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  

 The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if: 

(a) 

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs; and 

(b) 

the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first 
Australian port or airport at which  any cargo is intended to be discharged. 

If both conditions are not met by the end of the financial year to which the allocation 
relates, the goods will be taken to have been ‘entered for home consumption’ in the 
following financial year. 

In such circumstances, the goods are either entered: 

- 

- 

under quota for the following financial year (if the importer has sufficient 
quota for that year); or 

without concession at the rate of customs duty applicable to the relevant 
subheading of Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995.

The amber line facility 

The purpose of this Customs Notice is to clarify the effect of new offence provisions on 
the ‘amber line’ facility. This ACN replaces ACN 89/67. 

On 1 July 2002, the new Infringement Notice Scheme (INS) for certain strict liability 
offences in the Customs Act 1901 commenced as part of the Trade Modernisation 
legislation package.  

These new strict liability offence provisions include new section 243T, which provides 
that an owner commits an offence if a false or misleading statement resulting in loss of 
duty is made in respect of the owner’s goods. This provision, in combination with the 
INS, replaced the old administrative Penalty System in former sections 243T, 243U and 
243V. ACN 2002/38 refers. 

Section 243V in the old administrative penalty scheme allowed people to avoid an 
administrative penalty for a false or misleading statement resulting in an underpayment 
of duty by stating their uncertainty as to the correctness of the information, and their 
reasons for that uncertainty, at the time of lodging the import entry. This became known 
throughout Customs and the importing community as the ‘amber line’ facility. 

Under the new legislation, the ‘amber line’ facility has been retained in subsections 
243T(5) and (6) as exceptions to the strict liability offence for false statements resulting 
in a loss of duty. As the majority of statements that might be subject to an offence under 
243T are made in Customs entries, Customs has continued to provide a field on import 
entries for amber line statements to be made. 

There are some important considerations to be kept in mind when using the ‘amber line’ 
facility.  

Application 

The exception only applies in respect of a false or misleading statement that results in a 
loss of duty. It does not apply to false or misleading statements for exports, for imports 
where the statement does not result in loss of duty, in cargo reports or outturn reports. 

‘Amber line’ is considered appropriate for false or misleading statements resulting in a 
loss of duty because the penalty for such statements is directly related to the amount of 
duty short paid. The greater the short payment, the greater the penalty – with no upper

Notices of objection to importation - Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, 
the authorised user of a trademark to object to the importation of goods which 
infringe their trademark.  The registered owner, or authorised user does this by 
lodging a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  
Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two years 
from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have 
lodged Notices of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995.  The Notices notify 
the objections of these registered owners and authorised users to the importation of 
goods which infringe their trade mark or trade marks. Descriptions of the relevant 
trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a 
particular “class” of goods.  This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in 
Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a description of the 
goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is 
registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from 
Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into 
Australia: 

-  

have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical 
with, or deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

- 

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, 
lease, hire, etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a 
trade mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark 
is not infringed where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, 
goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
and Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the 
Prohibited Imports Regulations) and Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1956 
(the Prohibited Exports Regulations) relating to Iraq and East Timor commenced on 
gazettal on 29 May 2003 and 22 May 2003 respectively. 

Amendment of sanctions against Iraq 

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution 1483 (2003) 
terminating all prohibitions relating to trade with Iraq established by UNSC Resolution 
661 (of 1990) and subsequent resolutions, with the exemption explained below.  

As a result, regulation 4QA of the Prohibited Imports Regulations and regulation 13CA 
of the Prohibited Exports Regulations were repealed on Thursday 29 May 2003. 

However, UNSC Resolution 1483 maintains the prohibitions related to the sale or 
supply to Iraq of arms and related materiel but gives an exemption to items required 
by the Coalition in Iraq.  For more information on the control of defence exports, 
contact the Defence Trade Controls and Compliance Section of the Department of 
Defence on (02) 6266 2586 or at dtcc@defence.gov.au.  

Amendment of controls on movement of arms and related materiel to East Timor 

Regulations 3A and 3B of the Prohibited Imports Regulations and regulation 13E of the 
Prohibited Exports Regulations have been updated to exempt certain goods owned by a 
defence force or a police force of a country contributing to the multinational force 
aiding East Timor in accordance with UNSC Resolution 1410 (2002).  

These amendments exempt defence and police forces of countries contributing to the 
multinational force from the requirements contained in the Customs Prohibited Imports 
Regulations and the Customs Prohibited Exports Regulations relating to arms, 
ammunition and related materiel.

Alphabetical index to the Australian Harmonised Export Commodity 
Classification – 1 July 2003 

The Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) is compiled 
by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and is based on the six-digit 
international harmonised system developed by the World Customs Organization 
(WCO) for describing internationally traded goods. 

The AHECC is designed for use by exporters, customs brokers and freight forwarders 
for the classification of goods when providing export declarations to the Australian 
Customs Service, and to assist users in the interpretation of export statistics published 
by the ABS. The classification is normally updated on 1 January and 1 July each year. 

On 1 July 2003, there are no changes to the classification, but an alphabetic index for 
the AHECC will be made available. The updated index is in the same format as that 
available in the AHECC before the January 2002 issue. That is, index entries are 
provided at the four-, five- or six-digit levels as an aid to finding the correct 
classification code. 

Copies of the updated index will be available electronically from the ABS web site, 
free of charge, from 17 June 2003. Copies of the entire AHECC and previous AHECC 
updates will also be available from the web site at the same time, free of charge. 

To access these documents, go to the ABS web site www.abs.gov.au  then select 
Themes, International Trade. To download the AHECC index, select AHECC. This 
page will provide links to the manual as at 1 January 2002 (pdf file), the 1 July 2002,

Trophies won outside Australia – item 25A 

This Australian Customs Notice has been prepared to inform importers and brokers of 
revised guidelines for the operation of Item 25A of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff 
Act 1995.  This ACN replaces any previous notice issued regarding Item 25A. 

Item 25A applies to: “Trophies won outside Australia, as prescribed by by-law”. 

The standing by-law under the item has been revised to clarify that teams (in addition 
to individuals) have access to Item 25A, providing that they meet the conditions 
stipulated in the by-law. 

The terms of the revised by-law under Item 25A are as follows 

By-law 0340004: 
1.  This by-law may be cited as Customs By-Law No. 0340004. 
2.  This by-law shall take effect on and from 26 June 2003. 
3.  Item 25A in Part II of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 applies to 

trophies won outside Australia in competition being ornamental or utilitarian 
machines, appliances or articles of a kind used in an office or the household, 
or for display on walls or on stands or similar mounts.  

4.  For the purposes of this by-law, a certificate from the organisers of the 

competition stipulating the name of the winner, the event and the date of the 
competition and the scope of the competitors taking part in the competition, or 
copies of daily news media in which the competition was reported and with 
which the importer can be identified as a winner, will be sufficient to establish 
eligibility. 

5.  For the purposes of this by-law, the “Customs Tariff Act 1995” means the 

Customs Tariff Act 1995, as amended or proposed to be altered.

_____________________________________________________________________ 

Least-developed countries – rules of origin 

From 1 July 2003, goods that originate in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and in East 
Timor will be eligible for duty-free entry. The Prime Minister announced the decision in 
Los Cabos, Mexico on 25 October 2002. The purpose of this Notice is to outline the rules 
for determining whether goods originate in a LDC or in East Timor. 

Legislation 

Duty-free entry 

The Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) allows the entry of goods manufactured or 
produced in LDCs and East Timor free of import duty from 1 July 2003. The countries 
eligible for duty-free entry are listed in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Tariff, which is 
reproduced at Attachment A to this notice. 

Other duties and taxes 

While goods from LDCs and East Timor are free of import duty from 1 July 2003, excise-
equivalent duties, goods and services tax, dumping duties and other taxes and levies, 
including cost recovery charges, if relevant, are still payable. 

Rules of origin for duty-free entry  

Under Division 1A of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act), two categories of 
goods will be considered to be manufactured or produced in an LDC or East Timor for the 
purposes of duty-free entry: unmanufactured raw products and manufactured goods. 

(i)  Unmanufactured raw products 

Under section 153H of the Customs Act, goods are the produce of an LDC or East Timor 
if they are its unmanufactured raw products, as defined in section 4 of that Act.  

(ii)  Manufactured goods 

Under section 153NA, goods are the manufacture of an LDC if:  

(a)  the last process in the manufacture of the goods was performed in an LDC; and 

(b)  the allowable factory cost of the goods is not less than 50 per cent of the total factory 

cost of the goods. 

The above provisions, and the methods for calculating allowable factory costs and total 
factory costs, are similar to those for most other preference countries.

_____________________________________________________________________ 

Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement – Rules of Origin 

Goods that originate in Singapore will be entitled to duty-free entry once the Singapore-
Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) enters into force. 

SAFTA is expected to enter into force early in the 2003-04 financial year.  When the exact 
date is known, a COMPILE message will be issued. 

The purpose of this Notice is to summarise the rules for determining whether goods 
originate in Singapore. 

Legislation 

Duty-free entry 

The Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff), as amended by the Customs Tariff Amendment 
Act (No.1) 2003, will allow the entry of goods that are the produce or manufacture of 
Singapore free of import duty from the day that SAFTA enters into force.   

Other duties and taxes 

While goods from Singapore will be free of import duty from the day that SAFTA enters 
into force, excise-equivalent duties, goods and services tax, dumping duties and other taxes 
and levies, including cost recovery charges, if relevant, will still be payable. 

Rules of origin 

Goods will be the produce or manufacture of Singapore for the purposes of duty-free entry 
if they meet the rules of origin set out in Division 1B of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 
(the Act), as inserted by the Customs Amendment Act (No.1) 2003, comprising: a rule for 
wholly obtained goods produced in Singapore; a rule for goods that are wholly 
manufactured in Singapore; and two rules for goods that are partly manufactured in 
Singapore, one with accumulation provisions and another without. 

The concepts of “produce” and “manufacture” are defined in section 153UA of the Act.  
These definitions are relevant only for the purposes of Division 1B.  

Rule 1 – Wholly obtained goods  

Goods will be wholly obtained goods produced in Singapore if they are:  

(a)  unmanufactured raw products produced in Singapore; or 

(b)  waste and scrap produced in Singapore. 

The definitions of “unmanufactured raw products” and “waste and scrap” for the purpose 
of this rule are contained in section 153UA of the Act.  The definition of “unmanufactured 
raw products” set out in section 4 of the Act does not apply to goods of Singapore origin.

Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2003 (the Act), which received Royal Assent 
on 30 June 2003, makes the following changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the 
Tariff): 

East Timor 

lists East Timor as a Developing Country for the purposes of Part 3 of Schedule 1 
of the Tariff.  This change was previously included in Customs Tariff Proposal 
No. 2 (2003).  ACN No. 2003/23 refers. 

Least Developed Countries (LDCs) 

amends the Tariff to define Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and to provide 
for the duty-free entry of goods originating in LDCs, from 1 July 2003.  ACN 
No. 2003/48 provides details on the rules of origin for LDC preference and lists 
the countries eligible for duty-free entry. 

Singapore 

provides for the duty-free entry of goods from Singapore in accordance with the 
Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA).  These amendments will 
come into effect when SAFTA enters into force (expected to be early in the 
2003-04 financial year).  Rules of origin for SAFTA will be detailed in ACN 
2003/49, which will be released closer to the commencement of SAFTA.  
COMPILE information regarding preference indicator changes for SAFTA will 
also be advised in ACN No. 2003/49. 

Country Codes 

introduces two-character International Standards Organization (ISO) Country 
Codes throughout the Tariff, in anticipation of the commencement of the 
Integrated Cargo System on 1 July 2004.  Existing three- and four- letter country 
codes will continue to operate for entry processing purposes until that time.

Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 3 and 4 (2003) – ultra low sulphur 
diesel and aviation fuels 

Ultra low sulphur diesel (ULSD) and related products 

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2003) was tabled in Parliament on 25 June 2003 and 
contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff), effective 
from 1 July 2003.  The Proposal was tabled cognately with Excise Tariff Proposal 
No. 1 (2003) that makes equivalent alterations to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (the 
Excise Tariff). 

The Proposals alter the Customs and Excise Tariff classifications for diesel and 
similar products (kerosene, heating oil, stabilised crude petroleum oil and topped 
crude petroleum oil for use as fuel in an internal combustion engine and certain other 
uses) to provide for excise and customs duty differentials based on sulphur content. 

Commencing from 1 July 2003, diesel and similar products with high sulphur content 
(above 50 parts per million) will attract customs and excise duty at a rate of 39.143 
cents per litre (cpl), 1 cpl above the current diesel rate of 38.143 cpl.  Customs and 
excise duty on ultra low sulphur diesel (not exceeding 50 parts per million) and 
similar products will remain at 38.143 cpl. 

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2003) also increases the customs duty differential by 
a further 1 cpl from 1 January 2004 with a customs duty rate for high sulphur diesel 
and similar products of 40.143 cpl.  Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 (2003) makes 
equivalent alterations to the Excise Tariff. 

Details of the new tariff subheadings and statistical codes applicable to ultra low 
sulphur diesel and related products will be available on a COMPILE news message 
and on the Customs internet site in the near future. 

Aviation fuels 

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 4 (2003) was also tabled in Parliament on 25 June 2003 
and contains alterations to the Customs Tariff, effective from 1 July 2003.  The 
Proposal was tabled cognately with Excise Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2003) that makes

Amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 

The following amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 was 
notified in Special Gazette No. 257 dated 2 July 2003. The amendment commenced on 
7 July 2003. 

United Nations Security Council – Round logs and timber products from Liberia. 

On 6 May 2003 the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution 
1478 (2003) that calls for all States to take the necessary measures to prevent, for a 
period of 10 months, the import into their territories of all round logs and timber 
products originating in Liberia.  Customs has implemented Australia’s obligations to 
enforce this sanction through regulation 4Q of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) 
Regulations 1956. 

Resolution 1478 (2003) came into force on 7 July 2003.  At the end of the 10 month 
period, the UNSC will decide whether the measures should continue. 

The UNSC will also consider by 7 September 2003 how best to minimise any 
humanitarian or socio-economic impact of these measures, including the possibility of 
allowing timber exports from Liberia to resume in order to fund humanitarian 
programmes. 

Resolution 1478 (2003) builds on earlier sanctions imposed by the UNSC, namely an 
arms embargo, a ban on provision of military technical training or assistance, a ban on 
the importation of all rough diamonds from Liberia and travel restrictions on individuals 
including senior members of the Government of Liberia.

Amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 

The following amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
(the Regulations) was notified in Special Gazette No. S320 of 21 August 2003 and 
commenced on the same day. 

The amendment has been made at the request of the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Treasurer, the Minister administering Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974, to reflect 
recent amendments to the Trade Practices (Consumer Product Safety Standard) 
(Cigarette Lighters) Regulations 1997.   

Regulation 4S of the Regulations controls the importation of lighters into Australia.  
Under this control, a lighter is defined as a “disposable lighter, novelty lighter or 
refillable lighter”.   

The maximum value of a refillable lighter subject to Regulation 4S has been amended 
from a customs value of $2 to $5.  Accordingly, the new definition of a refillable lighter 
is:-  

    “a flame producing device that:   

(a)  is designed to light cigarettes, cigars or pipes; and 
(b) is designed to be refilled with fuel; and 
(c)  has a customs value, determined under section 159 of the Customs Act 1901, 

of $5 or less.”

Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2003 – preferential tariffs for 
Singapore and changed entry procedures for goods from Hong Kong, 
the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province 

Australian Customs Notice No. 2003/50 advised that Customs Tariff Amendment  
Act (No. 1) 2003 received the Royal Assent on 30 June 2003. 

That Notice advised that Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2003 contained 
amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to provide for the duty-free entry of 
goods from Singapore, in accordance with the Singapore-Australia Free Trade 
Agreement (SAFTA).  Those amendments will come into effect when SAFTA enters 
into force. 

Reference should be made to ACN No. 2003/49, which sets out the rules for 
determining whether goods originate in Singapore for the purposes of SAFTA. 

It is anticipated that SAFTA will enter into force in the near future.  A COMPILE 
message will be issued to advise of the exact date. 

The introduction of SAFTA will affect entry procedures for Singapore, Hong Kong, 
the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province.  In particular, different preference codes 
for these countries will apply when SAFTA enters into force. 

Entry procedures for goods from Singapore 

    Where goods meet the SAFTA rules of origin, the preference code “P” should 

be used on Customs entries to access the free rate of duty. 

    Where goods are manufactured in Singapore, but do not meet the SAFTA 

rules of origin, the preference code “R” should be used where a Developing 
Country (DCS or DCT) rate of duty applies. 

    The preference indicator “X” should be used where the general rate of duty 

applies.

Indexation of certain excise and customs tariff duty rates – August 2003 

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the 
Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer (except 
“home brew”) and tobacco increase on 1 August 2003.  The new rates are set out in 
Tables 1 and 2 of the Attachment to this Notice. 

The new rates of excise and customs duty listed in the Attachment are calculated by 
multiplying the current rates by an indexation factor.  This factor is calculated by 
dividing the most recent index number by the previous highest December or June index 
number.  Accordingly, the June 2003 index number (141.3) has been divided by the 
December 2002 number (139.5) to establish an indexation factor of 1.013.  As this factor 
is more than one, current rates of excise and customs duty will be increased by this factor.

_____________________________________________________________________ 

Amendment to the Customs Regulations 1926 – Australian Exports under the 
Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement 

The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), which entered into force on 
28 July 2003, imposes certain obligations on exporters of Australian goods to Singapore 
for which a tariff preference is to be claimed, as well as obligations on producers and 
manufacturers of those goods. 

The obligations are, in effect, limited to Australian exporters and manufacturers of beer 
and stout as these are the only goods subject to customs duty in Singapore.   

The obligations are contained in amendments to the Customs Regulations 1926 made by 
Customs Amendment Regulation 2003 (No. 5) which were notified in Special Gazette 
No. 286 of 24 July 2003.  They are summarised below.   

Legislation 

The Customs Amendment Act (No.1) 2003 inserts a new Division 4A into Part VI of the 
Customs Act 1901.  Division 4A provides for a head of power to make regulations placing 
certain obligations on producers, manufacturers and exporters wishing to take advantage 
of SAFTA. 

New regulations 105A, 105B and 105C of the Customs Regulations 1926 have been made 
for the purposes of Division 4A. 

Certificates of Origin, declarations and confirmations 

For Australian Made beer and stout for which a preferential tariff in Singapore is claimed, 
a valid Certificate of Origin and a declaration are required before the goods are exported 
from Australia.  The importer in Singapore needs to be in possession of both documents at 
the time of entry of the goods.  

The Australian exporter, or manufacturer, can apply for a Certificate of Origin by 
contacting the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) or the Australian 
Industry Group (AIG).  ACCI contacts are listed in Appendix 13 to Australian Customs 
Manual Volume 12, Export Control, which is available on the Customs website at

Duty recovery  

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) has been prepared to inform importers and brokers about 
legislative provisions and administrative arrangements applying to the recovery of unpaid Customs duty 
that should have been paid upon importation of goods.  It only applies to Customs duty and does not 
apply to the recovery of other taxes payable at the border, such as GST, WET and LCT. 

Legislation 

There are two sections of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act) that apply to duty recovery in the 
above circumstance.  They are: 

Section 153 – duties recoverable as Crown debts 

    Section 153 applies to the recovery of all duty where there is an outstanding liability to pay that 

duty. 

    The section is not limited in time, and is not limited to fraud. 

Section 165 – demands for duty short levied 

    Section 165 limits Customs capacity to recover short levies of duty or erroneous refunds of duty 
arising from a Customs error in the calculation of duty or the classification of the goods. It does 
not affect Customs capacity to recover short payments or erroneous refunds of duty arising 
from fraud or Customs being misinformed by the owner.  

    The section operates to limit Customs to, currently, one year to fix its duty related errors. An 

amendment in the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade 
Modernisation) Act 2001 (the ITM ACT) has been passed which will extend this period to four 
years.  The ITM Act is expected to commence later in 2004. 

Duty recovery procedures under section 153 and section 165 

The table below sets out duty recovery procedures under sections 153 and 165. The power to recover 
duty is contained in section 153.  Section 165 only applies to recovery circumstances where Customs 
has made an error resulting in a short levying of duty.  Most recovery circumstances will not involve 
section 165. 

Section 153 

Section 165 

Legislation 

All duties shall constitute Crown 
debts charged upon the goods in 
respect of which the same are 
payable and payable by the owner of 
the goods and recoverable at any 
time in any court of competent 
jurisdiction by proceedings in the 
name of the Collector.  

(1) When any duty has been short 
levied or erroneously refunded, the 
person who should have paid the 
amount short levied or to whom the 
refund has been erroneously made 
shall pay the amount short levied or 
repay the amount erroneously 
refunded on demand being made by 
the Chief Executive Officer within 12 
months from the date of the short levy 
or refund.

Notices of objection to importation - Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, 
the authorised user of a trademark to object to the importation of goods which 
infringe their trademark.  The registered owner, or authorised user does this by 
lodging a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  
Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two years 
from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have 
lodged Notices of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995.  The Notices notify 
the objections of these registered owners and authorised users to the importation of 
goods which infringe their trade mark or trade marks. Descriptions of the relevant 
trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a 
particular “class” of goods.  This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in 
Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a description of the 
goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is 
registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from 
Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into 
Australia: 

-  

have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical 
with, or deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

- 

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, 
lease, hire, etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a 
trade mark may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark 
is not infringed where the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, 
goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 (2003) – biodiesel 

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 (2003) was tabled in Parliament on 17 September 2003 and 
contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff), effective from 
18 September 2003. The Proposal was tabled cognately with Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 
(2003) that makes equivalent alterations to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (the Excise Tariff). 

The Proposals alter the Customs Tariff and the Excise Tariff to introduce customs and 
excise duties on biodiesel for use as fuel in an internal combustion engine and on biodiesel 
blends. 

These changes were announced in the 2003-04 Budget and form part of the Government’s 
fuel tax reform arrangements to bring all currently untaxed fuels used in internal combustion 
engines into the excise and customs duty system by 1 July 2008. 

Commencing from 18 September 2003, biodiesel and the biodiesel component of blends of 
biodiesel will attract customs and excise duty at a rate of 38.143 cents per litre (cpl). Other 
substances in a blend (with the exception of ethanol which will attract 38.143 cpl) will attract 
the rate of 38.143 cpl or 39.143 cpl depending on sulphur content. From 1 January 2004, 
the customs and excise duty increases from 39.143 cpl to 40.143 cpl for those substances 
with a high sulphur content.  

In the Customs Tariff, biodiesel is classified to new subheadings 1516.10.10 and 
1516.20.10, and other chemically modified animal and vegetable fats and oils are classified 
to new subheadings 1516.10.90 and 1516.20.90 with the latter goods retaining their current 
duty rate of Free. New subheadings are also created in Chapters 27 and 38 for blends of 
biodiesel and other substances. 

A grant equal to the customs and excise duty rates of 38.143 cpl will be payable under the 
Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (EG(CF)S) on locally manufactured and imported 
biodiesel from 18 September 2003 until 30 June 2008, on enactment of the EG(CF)S. From 
1 July 2008, the amount of grant paid will be reduced in five equal instalments, and from 
1 July 2012 biodiesel will, like other fuels used in internal combustion engines, attract excise 
and customs duty based on energy content and other factors, providing tax neutrality 
between fuels. 

Details of the new tariff subheadings and statistical codes applicable to biodiesel and 
biodiesel blends will be available on a COMPILE news message and on the Customs 
Internet site (www.customs.gov.au)  in the near future. 

Customs Tariff reprint pages will be issued as soon as possible to reflect these changes. 

Any queries relating to Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 (2003) should be directed to 
Manager, Tariff Legislation and External Review on 02 6275 6486.

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices 
of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995, since publication of Australian Customs Notice 2003/61.  
The Notices notify the objections of these registered owners and authorised users to the importation of 
goods which infringe their trade mark or trade marks. Descriptions of the relevant trade marks are also 
set out in the Schedule. 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of 
goods.  This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 
1995 and along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the 
particular trade mark is registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice 
from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into Australia: 

-  

have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that:

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, 
or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in 
question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the 
trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner 
of the trademark and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade 
mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of 
the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal 
practitioner,  as  to  the  implications  of  the  trade  marks  legislation,  and  the  meaning  of  terms  such  as 
""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

The trade mark owners’ contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers 
who may wish to contact the owner regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Oil and Natural Gas Concession 

Item 22 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) has been prepared to inform importers and brokers of revised 
legislative and administrative arrangements for the operation of Item 22 of Schedule 4 to the Customs 
Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) which relates to goods imported in connection with the exploration for, and 
development of, oil and natural gas resources.  This ACN replaces all previous advices dealing with 
Item 22. 

The terms of the revised Item and the associated by-law are outlined below. 

Item 22 of Schedule 4 to the Tariff: 

“Goods, as prescribed by by-law, for use in the exploration for oil or natural   
  gas, or in the development of oil or natural gas wells”.

This by-law may be cited as Customs By-law No.0340010. 
This by-law shall take effect on and from 18 October 2003. 
Item 22 in Part II of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 applies to goods that are 
subject to: 
(a) 
(b) 

a Tariff Concession Order (TCO); or 
a letter issued by an Industrial Supplies Office (issued no earlier than twelve 
months prior to the entry for home consumption of the goods) confirming, that 
in relation to the specified goods, there are no identified Australian producers 
of substitutable goods; and 

are for use directly in the exploration for oil or natural gas or in the development of oil 
or natural gas wells from the reservoir up to and including the christmas tree cap. 
For the purposes of this by-law “christmas tree cap” is defined as “the device attached 
on the top of the christmas tree flange for the purpose of sealing the well”. 
For the purposes of this by-law “goods” includes whole goods and parts and 
accessories therefor. 
This by-law does not apply to goods that have been declared by the Customs 
Regulations 1926, under paragraph 269SJ(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901, to be goods 
to which a TCO should not extend. 
For the purposes of this by-law goods used in the process of re-entering an existing        
well, extending the well into a new oil or gas zone or zones and “workovers” for the 
maintenance of the well are the subject of this by-law providing those processes are 
part of exploration for oil or natural gas, or in the development of oil or natural gas 
wells. 
For the purposes of this by-law, the “Customs Regulations 1926” means the Customs 
Regulations 1926, as amended. 
For the purposes of this by-law, the “Customs Tariff Act 1995” means the Customs

Revocation of unnecessary Tariff Concession Orders 

The purpose of this notice is to advise that the Australian Customs Service (Customs)  
is migrating Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs) to a new computer system as part of release 3 of the 
Cargo Management Re-Engineering Project. 

Prior to the migration of data, Customs will be reviewing all TCOs and will be revoking any unnecessary 
TCOs.  A TCO is considered to be unnecessary if the goods covered by that TCO can be imported 
under another, more recent TCO.  Quite often, the more recent TCO covers a broader range of goods.       

The TCOs to be revoked will be published in the Gazette at least 28 days before revocation.  The notice 
in the Gazette will include details of the (more recent) TCO that should be used following the revocation 
action. 

The process of reviewing and revoking unnecessary TCOs will be ongoing. 

Importers and customs brokers will not be disadvantaged by the revocation action, as TCOs will 
continue to apply to the same range of goods.  Before attempting to use a TCO, an importer or customs 
broker should check the list of concessional instruments to ensure that the TCO still exists.  

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to the Tariff Concessions Section on telephone number 
(02) 6275 6489 or fax number (02) 6275 6376.

CEO determination No 1 of 2003 - communication standards 

The Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001 inserts 
Part VIA into the Customs Act 1901 which relates to electronic communications with Customs. Section 
126D of the Customs Act requires the Customs CEO to establish and maintain information systems that 
enable persons to communicate electronically with Customs.  

Section 126DA requires the CEO to determine, and publish in the Commonwealth Gazette, certain 
information technology requirements that a person must meet to communicate electronically with 
Customs. CEO determination No 1 of 2003 was gazetted on 8 October 2003 and is in three parts. 

Part A  Requirements relating to communicating electronically with Customs 
A person may communicate by either using an electronic data interchange (EDI) message sent by 
email or by directly accessing the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) via the Customs website using the 
Customs Connect Facility (CCF). To provide secure communications, the person must register in the 
CCF and the ICS before the person can access the ICS. The EDI messages must meet a specific 
standard and they must be communicated to Customs using a specific type of email. The determination 
specifies the minimum Internet browser standard that a person must use to communicate with the ICS 
online.  

Part B  Requirements relating to electronic signatures 
If a person is required to sign an electronic communication with Customs, the person must do so using 
a digital certificate. A digital certificate must be issued by a Gatekeeper-accredited Certification 
Authority and be approved by Customs. Customs will accept four types of digital certificates that will 
accommodate the various types of persons who need to communicate with Customs – an individual, an 
organisation (with or without an Australian Business Number) and a special certificate that enables a 
device to sign EDI messages. EDI messages must be signed and encrypted using a digital certificate. 
Persons using the Customs Connect Facility must use a digital certificate to authenticate themselves 
when entering the CCF. 

Communications under section 119AA of the Customs Act 1901 
Persons making application under section 119AA by way of an email message will be required to 
provide certain details about themselves and any organisation they represent to enable Customs to 
establish the authenticity of the message. 

Part C  Requirements relating to producing documents to Customs electronically 
This part sets out the requirements that have to be met if a document, required to be produced to 
Customs, is produced electronically. 

At this stage, CEO determination No 1 of 2003 will be limited to cover those persons 
communicating with Customs electronically for the purposes of Division 2 of Part VI of the 
Act (ie exports). The determination will come into effect with the proclamation of the new 
exports measures currently expected to be mid February 2004. The determination will be 
remade in due course to cater for the IT requirements necessary to support the import 
process. Interested persons may view CEO determination No 1 of 2003 (2.8Mb PDF). 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to Customs by telephoning 1800 022 267 or by e-mail

State of origin for exports 

Purpose 

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice (ACN) is to assist exporters and their agents in reporting 
state of origin information as accurately as possible by providing advice on how the state of origin 
should be determined.  This ACN replaces ACN 2000/49. 

Background 

It is recognised that state of origin cannot be accurately reported in all cases, and these guidelines can 
be used to determine the best possible response in these circumstances.  They are intended to be used 
as a guide to what is expected in gathering details for reporting state of origin.  If these guidelines are 
followed, and data reported in accordance with them is accurate, the origin data element will be 
considered to be accurate by Customs. 

Definition of state of origin 

State of origin is the Australian state in which the final stage of production or manufacture occurs.  The 
final stage of production or manufacture does NOT include processes which essentially leave the good 
intact, such as repair, blending, packaging, bottling, cleaning, sorting, husking, and shelling.  The state 
of origin is NOT simply the state where: 

the head office of the exporter is located; 
the Customs entry/declaration is lodged; 
the goods were loaded on the international carrier. 

Determining state of origin 

The different situations an exporter can encounter, and the proposed methods of reporting as a result, 
are summarised in the attached flow chart.  The flowchart is intended to assist exporters to determine 
the most appropriate method of reporting for state of origin, based on their particular circumstances and 
the information available to them.  The exporter does not need to establish systems to gather additional 
information, but may need to provide some information to the person completing the export 
documentation.  

The flowchart presents decision points based on the ability to separate goods by state of production or 
state of supply, or, in cases of multiple sources, to identify a predominant source.  Where 
predominance is to be determined, this should be done in terms of the value of the goods involved. 

The flowchart decision points start with those which produce the most accurate state of origin (based on 
state of production) and work down through less accurate mechanisms based on the state of the 
suppliers of the goods.  If state of origin cannot be set using information about the state of production or 
the state of the supplier then, as a last resort, the state of export is used. 

When considering goods sourced partially or fully from outside Australia, the same rules should be 
applied, with the goods reported with an origin of 'goods of foreign origin, re-exported'.

Overtime charges for requested out-of-hours boarding duties 

Following a review which involved industry consultation, and in line with the cost-recovery 
policy in all other Australian ports, Customs has decided to introduce charges for out-of-
hours activities by officers conducting requested tasks in the ports of Melbourne, Geelong, 
Westernport and Port Welshpool.  

As of 1 December 2003, the Melbourne Boarding Response Unit will begin charging 
merchants overtime fees for out-of-hours attendances. Fees will be charged for attendances 
that occur on weekends and public holidays and outside Monday-to-Friday working hours 
(8:30am to 5:00pm) as stated in Regulation 19(1) of the Customs Regulations 1926.  

Overtime fees are not incurred for attendances that involve only the checking of passenger 
baggage at an appointed port or wharf – for example, checking baggage of previously 
immigration-cleared passengers/transit passengers [Reg 19(1) Item 4]. 

All other Customs functions that are requested and occur out of hours as above will incur 
overtime charges [Reg 19(1) Item9]. 

Schedule of charges 

    The overtime rate per officer per hour of attendance (or part there of) including 

travelling time is $43.35 [Reg 20(1)].  

    The number of officers required for an attendance is at the discretion of Customs.  
    The travel charge for a departmental vehicle is 58 cents per kilometre of travel to 

and from the place where the function is performed [Reg 20(3)(b)].  

These rates were current at 28 October 2003. Notification will be made of any rate changes.  

Overtime billing 

Overtime payments will be billed as for out-of-hours vessel clearance through the Accounts 
Receivable Section and are to be settled on either a daily or monthly account. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to the Supervisor Boarding Response Unit 
on telephone number (03) 9244 9125 or fax number (03) 9244 9130.

Updates to the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity 
Classification - 1 January 2004 

The Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) is compiled by the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and is based on the six-digit international harmonized 
system developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO) for describing internationally 
traded goods. 

The AHECC is designed for use by exporters, customs brokers and freight forwarders for the 
classification of goods when providing export declarations to the Australian Customs 
Service, and to assist users in the interpretation of export statistics published by the ABS. 
The classification is normally updated on 1 January and 1 July each year. 

The ABS has finalised the changes required for the 1 January 2004 AHECC updates. These 
changes affect the Introduction, Key of changes, and some codes in Chapters 02, 08 and 
99. 

The 1 January 2004 updates will be available from the ABS website, from 12 December 
2003, free of charge. Copies of the entire AHECC and previous AHECC updates will also be 
available from the web site at the same time, free of charge. In addition, a completely 
updated web-readable version of the AHECC will be available. 

To access these documents, go to the ABS website www.abs.gov.au  then select Themes, 
International Trade, AHECC. To download the current or previous AHECC replacement 
pages, follow the links under the heading 'AHECC replacement pages'. If a complete 
AHECC is required, follow the link 'AHECC January 2004 issue' under 'Complete AHECC'. 

Queries about this ACN should be directed to the Classifications Manager at the ABS on

Exports cutover to be postponed - Cargo Management  
Re-engineering (CMR) update 

Customs has agreed for a second time to change the date that exporters must switch over to 
the new Integrated Cargo System.  Customs Chief Executive Officer Lionel Woodward 
agreed with industry leaders at the December 2003 meeting of the Customs National 
Consultative Committee that the ICS is not yet sufficiently stable for Customs and industry to 
be ready for implementation by 1 March 2004.  

Instead of simply announcing a replacement for the planned 1 March cutover date, Customs 
will adopt a new approach.  In response to calls from the trading community, and in 
particular from developers of export business software, Customs will not announce a new 
date until it and key stakeholders are confident of the system’s reliability.  Once a stable 
product has been achieved further advice will be provided to users about cutover to the new 
exports system.  Customs objective is to ensure all stakeholders have around three months 
from that time to finish preparations. 

While setting and meeting dates is an important part of planning for the transition from the 
old systems to the new, Customs will not compromise the quality of the ICS package or 
place unreasonable demands on industry, just to meet scheduled dates.  Our priority must 
be to develop a reliable system.  Once it is confirmed that the systems are robust and stable 
and a cutover date is set, further advice will be posted on the Customs website 
www.customs.gov.au (follow the links to Cargo Management Re-engineering) and emailed 
to anyone who has registered through the website for CMR information. 

In the meantime, the planned December 2003 rollout of the latest version of the ICS (V3) for 
industry testing will now take place very early next year.  Customs will then liaise closely with 
software developers to fine tune system reliability.  Customs will still be rolling out the larger 
imports system for testing in the first half of 2004, and will then apply the same approach of 
consolidating the release before fixing a cutover date.

marks. Descriptions of the relevant trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of 
goods.  This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 
1995 and along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the 
particular trade mark is registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice 
from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into Australia: 

-  

have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or 
deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

- 

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, 
or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in 
question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the 
trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner 
of the trademark and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade 
mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of 
the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal 
practitioner,  as  to  the  implications  of  the  trade  marks  legislation,  and  the  meaning  of  terms  such  as 
""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

The trade mark owners’ contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers 
who may wish to contact the owner regarding use of the trade marks in question.

New Import Control on Asbestos 

An amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the PI Regulations) 
commenced on 31 December 2003.  Regulation 4C of the PI Regulations restricts the 
importation of asbestos and goods containing asbestos.   

Asbestos can be divided into two categories: amphibole asbestos and chrysotile.   

Under the provisions of this control, amphibole asbestos and goods containing amphibole 
asbestos can only be imported under the following conditions: 

1.  The amphibole asbestos occurs as a naturally occurring trace in a raw material;  

2.  The  Minister  for  Employment  and  Workplace  Relations  (the  Minister)  or  a  person 
authorised by that Minister has confirmed that he or she has granted a permission to 
import the amphibole asbestos or goods; or  

3. 

It is a hazardous waste as defined in section 4 of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation 
of  Exports  and  Imports)  Act  1989  (the  HW  Act).    All  hazardous  waste  must  be 
imported in accordance with the requirements of the HW Act. 

The amendments to the PI Regulations also prohibit the importation into Australia of 
chrysotile or goods listed in part 1 of Schedule 3B to the PI Regulations (see Attachment A) 
that contain chrysotile unless: 

1.  The  chrysotile  is,  or  goods  are,  hazardous waste  under  section  4  of  the  Hazardous 

Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989;  

2.  The  chrysotile  is,  or  goods  are,  to  be  used  for  a  purpose  listed  in  Part  2  of 
Schedule 3B  of  the  PI Regulations  (see  Attachment  B)  or  for  research,  analysis  or 
display,  the  importation  is  on  or  before  the  expiry date  listed  in  the  Schedule and  a 
confirmation has been granted in respect of the chrysotile or goods by: 

    The Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority (SSRCA);  

    The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission (SRCC); or  
    A relevant State/Territory occupational health and safety (OH&S) authority.   

3.  The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (the Minister) or an authorised 
person confirms that he/she has granted a permission to import for the purposes of 
research, analysis or display;  

4.  The goods are being imported from the Australian Antarctic Territory; or 

5.  The chrysotile exists as a naturally occurring trace element in a raw material.   

In addition to the exclusions above, the import control does not apply to goods containing 
chrysotile when the good is “in-situ”.  This exemption only covers instances where the good 
containing chrysotile has been incorporated into a separate, larger item being imported (such 
as a machine or vehicle) in such a way that it does not constitute a risk to users unless the 
chrysotile in the good is disturbed.

National Occupational Health and Safety Commission website at

New Export Control on Asbestos 

An amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1956 (the PE Regulations)

of asbestos and goods containing asbestos.  A list of goods containing asbestos is included 
in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the PE Regulations (see Attachment A).   

Under the provision of the new control, the export of asbestos or goods containing asbestos

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2004-05.pdf,Amendments to false and misleading statement provisions in the Customs Act,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2004/05 

Amendments to false and misleading statement provisions in 
the Customs Act 

The Customs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 2003 (the CLA (2) Act), which received 
Royal Assent on 17 December 2003, includes amendments to the false and misleading 
statement offence provisions of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act). These 
amendments will take effect on 14 January 2004.  

There are provisions in the Customs Act that make it an offence to ‘make a statement that is 
false or misleading in a material particular’ or to ‘omit a thing or matter from a statement, 
without which it is false or misleading in a material particular’. For simplicity, this Notice will 
refer to all such statements as ‘false statements’, but the information detailed below also 
applies to misleading statements and to statements that are false or misleading as the result 
of an omission. 

The amendments ensure that these offence provisions take account of the complexity of 
emerging commercial arrangements for communicating with Customs within the importing 
and exporting community.  

Liability for false statements that do not result in a loss of duty  

Sections 243U and 243V of the Customs Act have been amended to provide that, where a 
false statement that does not result in a loss of duty is made, liability for the offence rests 
not only on the person who ‘makes’ the statement but also on any person who ‘caused’ the 
statement be made. By broadening the class of possible offenders to cover all those 
potentially involved in the making of the statement, Customs will have the flexibility to target 
where the breakdown in accuracy occurred, rather than being limited to the final 
communicator of the information to Customs.  

For example, if an owner provides false information to a broker and the broker includes that 
information in a communication to Customs, the owner will have ‘caused’ the false 
statement to be made. If, however, the broker incorrectly transcribes accurate information 
provided by the owner and then communicates it to Customs, then the broker will be liable 
for having made the false statement. 

Similar amendments have been made to the fault-based false statement offences in section 
234 of the Customs Act, making an offence to intentionally give information to another 
person, knowing that the information is false or misleading in a material particular and that 
the other person or someone else will include that information in a statement to Customs. 

Consequential amendments have also been made to the record-retention obligations in 
section 240AB of the Customs Act so that any one involved in preparing or sending 
communications to Customs must keep records that verify the content of those 
communications and enable Customs to trace information included in communications to its 
source.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2004-07.pdf,Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002 – Reporting of cargo,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2004/07 

Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002 – Reporting 
of cargo 

This ACN references ACN 2002/72 ‘Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002 – 
changes to sea cargo reporting’ and clarifies requirements for reporting mail and other goods as 
cargo. 

Changes to air cargo reporting for these matters are contained in ACN 2002/69. 

The terms ‘cargo’ and ‘mail’ are defined in section 63A of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) as:  

Cargo, in relation to a ship or aircraft, includes any mail carried on the ship or aircraft. 

Mail in relation to a ship or aircraft, means:  

(a)  any goods consigned through the Post Office that are carried on the ship or aircraft; 

and  

(b)  any other correspondence carried on the ship or aircraft that is not consigned as 

cargo and that is not accompanied personal or household effects of a passenger or 
member of the crew.  

Note: Correspondence covered by paragraph (b) would include, for example, an airline's inter-
office correspondence that is carried on one of the airline's aircraft and that is not consigned 
as cargo. 

The note to section 63A of the Act is not exclusive, and for the purposes of cargo reporting 
covers ships and shipping lines. 

Reporting of all goods consigned as cargo 

All cargo should be fully reported by means of Sea Cargo Automation (SCA), or where SCA is 
not currently used to report cargo, by means of the Ships Inwards Cargo Report (Form 1). 

Goods with a value of less than $250 carried per favour of the Master or crew, not being the 
property of the shipping company, must be declared on the Form 5 Part 2 (Crew Effects 
Declaration) or on a parcel list attached to the Form 5 Part 2.  Goods reported in this way will 
require prior permission from Customs  and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service 
(AQIS) prior to landing.  This is the existing requirement and the procedure is not intended to be 
changed.   

However, goods carried ‘per favour’ that exceed the threshold for a Customs Entry (currently 
$250), should not be included as favour parcels, but manifested as cargo and an Entry for 
Home Consumption (N10) completed and duty and GST paid as applicable. 

All shipping company cargo previously carried ‘per favour’ is to be reported as cargo and 
manifested irrespective of the value of the goods.  This includes, but is not restricted to, 
shipping company container seals, blank bills of lading, company stationery not being 
correspondence, and gifts.

Indexation of certain excise and customs tariff duty rates – 
February 2004 

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff 
Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer (except “home brew”) and 
tobacco increase on 2 February 2004.  The new rates are set out in Tables 1 and 2 of the 
Attachment to this Notice. 

The new rates of excise and customs duty listed in the Attachment are calculated by multiplying 
the current rates by an indexation factor.  This factor is calculated by dividing the most recent 
index number by the previous highest December or June index number.  Accordingly, the 
December 2003 index number (142.8) has been divided by the June 2003 number (141.3) to 
establish an indexation factor of 1.011.  As this factor is more than one, current rates of excise 
and customs duty will be increased by this factor.

ICS implementation for exports – cutover date announced 

The introduction of Customs new computer system, the Integrated Cargo System (ICS), and 
related legislative changes is fast approaching.  Customs clients will need to update or replace 
their current computer software, and review business processes to complement new legislation 
in order to meet the new cargo management requirements. 

The export component of the ICS will ‘go-live’ on 22 September this year.  After a two-week 
transition period, Customs existing export reporting system, EXIT, will cease operations at 
2.00am, 6 October 2004 (AEST).  From this date all electronic reporting of export cargo will 
occur through the ICS.  

Clients who communicate directly with Customs should be looking at the new options for 
connecting to the ICS to ensure they can continue reporting exports from 6 October 2004.  

The introduction of the ICS and related legislation will require businesses, in the exporting 
chain, to review business practices and IT provisions to ensure the smooth movement of cargo 
during the transition. 

Industry has four months to get ready for the implementation of the ICS.  To assist with this 
preparation, Customs will be holding free export functionality refresher training.  Training will be 
held during July, August and September in all capital cities and some major regional centres. 
The exports refresher training schedule is posted on the CMR website. 

For more information go to www.customs.gov.au (follow the links to Cargo Management Re-
engineering), email cmr@customs.gov.au or phone the CMR hotline on 1800 022 267.

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (the 
Prohibited Exports Regulations) were notified in Gazette No. S82 of 18 March 2004. 

Regulation 7 of the Prohibited Exports Regulations prohibits the export of human embryos 
without the permission of the Minister for Justice and Customs.  That regulation was due to 
cease to have effect at the end of 27 March 2004. 

The amendment to regulation 7 extends the export control until 31 July 2006.  This will enable 
the regulation to be reviewed as part of the review of the Prohibition of Human Cloning Act 2002 
and the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002.  The legislative authority for the 
amendments is Customs (Prohibited Exports) Amendment Regulations 2004 (No 1) - Statutory 
Rules No 32. 

The amendments do not alter any other part of the regulation.  Anyone wishing to export a 
human embryo will need to apply for permission from the Minister for Justice and Customs 
through the Attorney-General’s Department (ACN 2003/24 refers).

Notices of Objection to Importation 
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The  Trade  Marks  Act  1995  allows  the  registered  owner,  or  in  certain  circumstances,  the  authorised 
user  of  a  trademark  to  object  to  the  importation  of  goods  which  infringe  their  trademark.    The 
registered  owner,  or  authorised  user  does  this  by  lodging  a  Notice  of  Objection  with  the  Australian 
Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of 
two years from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices 
of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995.  The Notices notify the objections of these registered 
owners  and  authorised  users  to  the  importation  of  goods  which  infringe  their  trade  mark  or  trade 
marks. Descriptions of the relevant trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of 
goods.  This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 
1995 and along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the 
particular trade mark is registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice 
from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into Australia: 

-  

have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or 
deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

- 

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, 
or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in 
question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the 
trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner 
of the trademark and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade 
mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of 
the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal 
practitioner,  as  to  the  implications  of  the  trade  marks  legislation,  and  the  meaning  of  terms  such  as 
""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

The trade mark owners’ contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers 
who may wish to contact the owner regarding use of the trade marks in question.

Notices of Objection to Importation 
Copyright Act 1968 

The Copyright Act 1968 allows the owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, to object to the 
importation of goods that infringe their copyright.  The owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, 
does this by lodging a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless 
revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two years from the date of 
commencement.    

The attached Schedule sets out the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, who have lodged a 
Notice of Objection under the Copyright Act 1968.  The Notices notify the objections of the copyright 
owners, and exclusive licensees, to the importation of goods that infringe their copyright. A description 
of where copyright is claimed is also set out in the Schedule. 

Goods identified by Customs at the border as potentially infringing copyright are liable to be seized by 
Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); 
or 
the goods do not infringe the copyright. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of 
the Copyright Act 1968 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal 
practitioner, as to the implications of the copyright legislation. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital 
city of each State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding 
the Notices of Objection, or Customs’ role in respect of those Notices, should contact Customs 
Information on 1300 363 263 or the Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6275 6577.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
Import of Paintball Markers 

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the 
Regulations) were notified in Gazette No. S133 of 30 April 2004.   

Regulation 4F and Schedule 6 of the Regulations restrict the importation of paintball markers. 

The purpose of the amendments is to allow the importation of semi-automatic paintball markers 
and their parts into Australia under the Police Authorisation Test.   

The amendments create a new item number, 14A, in Part 2 of Schedule 6 for single shot, 
repeating action and self-loading paintball markers and their parts.  Both handgun markers and 
longarm markers of these categories are controlled under item 14A. 

To import these types of paintball markers the importer must comply with the Police 
Authorisation Test by obtaining a police authorisation (B709A) prior to importation.  A unique 
serial number on the paintball marker is also required. 

The amendments also introduce a modified safety test specifically designed for paintball 
markers. 

Paintball ammunition is now specifically included in the controls under item 20 and most 
importers will import under the Police Authorisation Test (B709A). 

Automatic paintball markers and any markers that resemble automatic firearms, such as a sub-
machine gun, an assault rifle, a machine gun or a machine pistol fall to item 12.  These paintball 
markers require the Attorney-General’s permission to import, which will be granted for official 
purposes or specified purposes only.   

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to Manager Firearms and Detained Goods on 
telephone number (02) 6275 5873 or fax number (02) 6275 6699.

Application for a Customs Broker’s Licence 

Exemption from Requirement – Approved Course of Study 

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) is to provide prospective Customs Brokers with advice 
on requesting an exemption from the requirement to complete the approved course of study. 

Section 183CC of the Customs Act 1901 sets out the requirements that must be satisfied before 
the Chief Executive Officer of Customs (the CEO) may grant a Customs Broker’s Licence, 
including a requirement that the applicant must be qualified to be a Customs Broker.  An 
applicant is taken to be qualified if he or she has: 

(1)  

acquired experience that in the opinion of the CEO, fits the applicant to be a Customs 
Broker; and 

(2)  

completed the course of study or instruction approved by the CEO. 

Currently, the approved course of study is a Certificate IV in Australian and International Trade 
Facilitation conducted by certain Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutions in 
Australia.  Section 183CC allows the CEO to exempt an applicant from the requirement to 
complete the approved course of study if, having regard to the experience or training of the 
applicant, he considers it appropriate to do so. 

Applicants who wish to be considered for such an exemption should obtain written recognition 
of prior learning (RPL) for the subjects covered by the approved course of study from a TAFE 
institution  that  conducts  the  approved  course  of  study,  and  provide  the  relevant  documents 
together  with  their  application.    Information  on  RPL  can  be  found  on  the  Australian  National 
Training Authority Internet site at www.anta.gov.au.  

The TAFE institutions that conduct the approved course of study are:

Information  on  the  approved  course  of  study  can  be  found  in  ACN  98/44  on  the  Customs 
Internet site at www.customs.gov.au.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
- Dangerous Dogs 

The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 have been amended to remove the 
absolute prohibition on the importation of four breeds of dog to permit their importation for 
certain scientific purposes.  The amendments were notified in Special Gazette No. S212 dated 
18 June 2004.  The amendments commenced on notification. 

The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry or a person authorised by the Minister may

The scientific purposes are the same as those set out in the Australian Code of Practice for the 
Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes as administered by the National Health and 
Medical Research Council.  In deciding whether to grant a permission, the Minister or an 
authorised person has to take into account whether the place at which the dog is to be used 
conforms with the Code and whether an Animal Ethics Committee (established in accordance 
with the Code) has approved the scientific purpose. 

The permission to import the nominated breeds of dogs as issued by the Minister for 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry or an authorised person is to be produced to a Collector.

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
(the PI Regulations) and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958  
(the PE Regulations) relating to the control of ozone depleting substances and 
synthetic greenhouse gases were notified in Special Gazette No. S187 dated 
3 June 2004.  The amendments commenced on notification. 

The amendments complement the regulation of the import and export of these 
substances under the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management 
Act 1989 (the OPSGGM Act). In essence, the importer or exporter must be licensed 
under the OPSGGM Act to import or export the controlled substances. 

Details of the new controls are set out below.  A fact sheet has been developed to 
assist importers and exporters to understand the requirements of these new controls.  
This fact sheet is available on the Customs website www.customs.gov.au.  

Import 

Amended regulation 5K of the PI Regulations prohibits the importation, without a 
licence, of a substance mentioned in Schedule 10 to the PI Regulations as well as 
pre-charged equipment, being air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment containing 
a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) or a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and including such 
equipment that is fitted to motor vehicles. 

Previously regulation 5K exempted goods under certain tariff classifications from the 
prohibition.  The amended regulation removes these and provides new exceptions to 
this prohibition.  The new exemptions are: 

importations from external Territories as these are not subject to the OPSGGM 
Act; 
importations of a substance mentioned in Schedule 10 that is contained in goods 
that will use the substance in the operation of the goods or is present in the goods 
because the substance was used in the manufacturing process for the goods, for 
example in an aerosol; 
importations of a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), a HCFC or a synthetic greenhouse 
gas (SGG) on board a ship or aircraft that is used exclusively to service or 
maintain air-conditioning or refrigeration equipment during international journeys; 
and 
importations of an SGG for use as a cover gas in the manufacture and casting of

Safrole and Isosafrole in Essential Oils 

The purpose of this notice is to assist industry to identify potential imports of safrole, which 
requires an import licence issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). 

Safrole and related compounds are properly imported under tariff items 2932.94.00 (safrole), 
2932.91.00 (isosafrole), 2932.93.00 (piperonal) and 2932.90 (MDP2P, also known as 3,4 
methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone, piperonylemetylketone, PMK).  

However Customs has observed shipments of safrole and safrole containing oils described as 
""essential oil(s)"" (not otherwise described), ""essential oil(s) other than citrus"" or ""essential 
oil(s) - other"", mainly but not exclusively under tariff items 3301.29.00 and/or 3301.90.00. 

A description of goods covering an essential oil(s) consignment that contains any of the words 
or phrases: sassafras, safrole, isosafrole, sassafras oil, Chinese sassafras oil, yellow 
camphor oil, or brown camphor oil indicates with certainty that the goods contain safrole or 
isosafrole, and the importer must comply with import licensing and permit requirements. 

An exception to this is “white camphor oil”. Although coming from the same Chinese 
plant Cinnamomum camphora, the white camphor oil does not contain safrole and does 
not require a permit. 

A goods description of “camphor oil” or ""Chinese camphor oil"" is insufficient. 
Clarification from the owner as to the type of the oil (white, yellow or brown camphor oil) 
must be sought before making any determination or declaration that the goods do not 
contain safrole. 

In addition, high concentrations of safrole occur naturally in some, but not all, essential oils 
derived from plants of the genus Cinnamomum, cultivated commercially in South East Asia, a 
range of plants of the genus Ocotea and Piper, cultivated commercially in South America, and 
the plant Sassafras albidum, growing in North America. 

Any shipment of essential oils derived from the plants named Cinnamomum burmannii, Ocotea 
preciosa, Ocotea cymbarum and Piper hispidinervium may have a high content of safrole.  

Importation of generically described essential oils by a consignee apparently unconnected with 
flavours and fragrances industry, perfumery and cosmetics industry, pharmaceutical or 
chemical industry might be an indicator of covert supply of safrole to clandestine manufacture 
of illicit drugs in Australia. Your assistance in identifying such shipments is sought – please 
report suspicious consignments to Frontline on 1800 06 1800.  

BACKGROUND – SAFROLE and REASONS for REGULATION 
Safrole (tariff item 2932.94.00) and isosafrole (tariff item 2932.91.00) are chemicals legitimately 
used in production of heliotropin (piperonal), a fragrance and flavour substance used by the 
food industry, piperonal butoxide (PBO), an ingredient of some insecticides, and in perfumery 
and production of perfumed soap. (Safrole and related compounds were historically used in root 
beer and sarsaparilla food flavours, but have been phased out of use in the food industry, as 
they are carcinogenic if ingested - their consumption is linked with liver cancer.)

Commonwealth of Australia Tariff Concessions Gazette: 
New Publication Arrangements 

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice is to inform importers, brokers and other interested 
parties of changes to the publication of the Commonwealth of Australia Tariff Concessions Gazette (the 
Tariff Concessions Gazette). 

The Tariff Concessions Gazette gives legal effect to the creation of a number of instruments such as 
Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs), TCO Revocations, By-Laws and Determinations.  It also provides an 
avenue to identify, advise and inform on a number of tariff concession issues. 

The Tariff Concessions Gazette is published by the Trade Branch of the Australian Customs Service 
(Customs) each Wednesday except over the Christmas and New Year period. 

On Wednesday, 18 August 2004, Customs will cease publishing ‘hard copies’ of the Tariff Concessions 
Gazette.  This decision has been taken because Customs clients are increasingly accessing the 
information on the Internet and because the very small number of subscriptions for the Tariff 
Concessions Gazette makes publication no longer economic.  Customs will continue to publish the 
Tariff Concessions Gazette, free of charge, on the Customs Internet site at: http://www.customs.gov.au. 

From the homepage of the Customs Internet site, interested parties should select “media, publications 
and forms” and then “tariff concessions gazette”.  The gazettes are listed in date order and may be 
selected from the list of Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) Files. 

Inquiries concerning this notice should be directed to the Tariff Concessions Section in Canberra by

Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Act 2004 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Act 2004 – Act No. 65 of 2004 – received Royal Assent 
on 22 June 2004. The Act amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) by enacting changes 
previously included in the following Customs Tariff Proposals: 

    No. 3 (2003) – Imposed a customs duty of 1 cent per litre for high sulphur diesel on top of 
the normal diesel rate of 38.143 cents per litre from 1 July 2003, and 2 cents per litre from 
1 January 2004 (Australian Customs Notice (ACN) No. 2003/51 refers); 

    No. 4 (2003) – Increased the rate of customs duty for aviation fuels by 0.306 cents per litre 
to $0.03151 per litre for aviation kerosene and to $0.03114 per litre for aviation gasoline 
(ACN No. 2003/51 refers); and 

    No. 5 (2003) – Imposed customs duty on biodiesel for use as a fuel in an internal 

combustion engine at the rate of 38.143 cents per litre, the same rate that applies to ultra 
low sulphur diesel (ACN No. 2003/63 refers). 

The Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Act 2004 implemented equivalent changes in the Excise 
Tariff Act 1921. 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Act 2004 also implemented minor consequential 
amendments to the Tariff and to the Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2003. The latter Act 
provided duty-free access to goods originating in Least Developed Countries and Singapore. 

Tariff reprint pages relevant to the above amendments were issued during 2003.

and External Review, on (02) 6275 6486.

No updates to the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity 
Classification on 1 July 2004 

The Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) is compiled by the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and is based on the six-digit international harmonized 
system developed by the World Customs Organization for describing internationally traded 
goods. 

The AHECC is designed for use by exporters, customs brokers and freight forwarders for the 
classification of goods when providing export declarations to the Australian Customs Service, 
and to assist users in the interpretation of export statistics published by the ABS. The 
classification is normally updated on 1 January and 1 July each year. 

The January 2004 issue is the current version of the AHECC. However, as there have been no 
changes to the classification since January 2004, a July 2004 issue of the AHECC will not be 
released.  

Copies of the entire AHECC and previous AHECC updates are available from the ABS web site 
free of charge.  To access these documents, go to the ABS web site www.abs.gov.au then 
select Themes, International Trade, AHECC. To download the AHECC replacement pages, 
follow the links under the heading ‘AHECC replacement pages’. If a complete AHECC is 
required, follow the link ‘AHECC January 2004 issue’ under ‘Complete AHECC’.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
Unmanufactured Tobacco Leaf 

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
(the PI Regulations) relating to the control of the importation of unmanufactured 
tobacco leaf were notified in Special Gazette No. 349 dated 26 August 2004.  The 
amendments commenced on gazettal.  

The amendments repeal item 2 of Schedule 3 to the PI Regulations and insert new 
regulation 4D.  Regulation 4D prohibits the importation of unmanufactured tobacco leaf 
mentioned in subheading 2401.10.00 of Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 unless 
the importer is the holder of a dealer licence, or a manufacturer licence for tobacco or 
tobacco products, granted under the Excise Act 1901, and a permission to import has been 
granted by the Commissioner of Taxation. 

Regulation 4D also sets out other matters relating to the permission-based regime, 
including: 

factors to be considered in granting a permission; 
the revocation of a permission under certain circumstances; 
notification of adverse decisions; 
the review of adverse decisions; and 
the saving of existing consents granted by the Treasurer under previous Item 2 
of Schedule 3 to the PI Regulations. 

It is important to note that existing consents to import unmanufactured tobacco leaf 
granted by the Treasurer remain valid until their expiry date and subject to any 
conditions attached to those consents. 

Enquiries regarding this notice may be directed to Community Protection Policy on 
telephone (02) 6275 6114 or via email to community.protection@customs.gov.au. 

Enquiries about obtaining a permit to import unmanufactured tobacco leaf should be 
directed to the Australian Taxation Office on telephone 1300 137 295 or fax number

Indexation of certain excise and customs tariff duty rates – 
August 2004 

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs 
Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer (except “home brew”) 
and tobacco increase on 2 August 2004.  The new rates are set out in Tables 1 and 2 of the 
Attachment to this Notice. 

The new rates of excise and customs duty listed in the Attachment are calculated by 
multiplying the current rates by an indexation factor.  This factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent index number by the previous highest December or June index number.  
Accordingly, the June 2004 index number (144.8) has been divided by the December 2003 
number (142.8) to establish an indexation factor of  1.014.  As this factor is more than one, 
current rates of excise and customs duty will be increased by this factor.

Sea Cargo Examination Arrangements  

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) outlines Customs enhanced role in the screening and 
inspection of sea cargo into and out of Australia.  The protection of the Australian borders 
means that Customs has to take a more interventionist role in the inspection of cargo.  
Importers and exporters need to ensure they make provision in their logistics arrangements for 
the possibility of Customs inspecting their cargo at a container examination facility.  Importers 
should recognise that a small proportion of cargo will be delayed by the inspection process and 
make allowance for this in their internal business processes.   

This ACN replaces ACN 2003/27.   

Background 
As  part  of  its  commitment  to  the  Protecting  Our  Borders  and  Tough  on  Drugs  strategies  the 
Government  has  made  significant  investments  in  the  establishment  of  Customs  container 
examination  facilities  (CEFs)  in  Melbourne,  Sydney,  Brisbane  and  Fremantle.  The  CEFs  use 
container  x-ray  technology  and  where  further  consideration  is  warranted,  containers  are 
physically examined utilizing a range of additional technologies.   

The  CEFs  have  contributed  significantly  to  the  protection  of  Australia’s  borders  by  increasing 
the cargo inspection rate.  This has had direct and indirect benefits for the Australian community 
and industry.  In the 18 months since the first CEF commenced operation, the community has 
benefited  from  very  significant  detections  of  illicit  drugs,  revenue  evasion,  weapons  and  other 
prohibited imports.  

The introduction of a more comprehensive cargo inspection regime also provides protection to 
legitimate  industry  through  the  detection  and  deterrence  of  non-compliant  importers.    More 
comprehensive  monitoring  allows  Customs  and  other  regulatory  agencies  to  establish  and 
validate  risk  profiles  and  so  provide  improved  facilitation  to  low  risk  clients.    The  CEFs  also 
represent a considerable deterrent barrier. Importantly, these strategies will also serve to assure 
foreign governments and trading partners of the security and integrity of trade with Australia. 

On  20  July  2004,  as  part  of  its  enhancements  of  maritime  security,  the  Government  provided 
additional funding for the CEFs to extend their hours of operation and throughput to an annual 
target of 100,000 containers (133,000 TEU - Twenty-foot Equivalent Units) per annum, which is 
seven  per  cent  of  total  loaded  import  containers.    To  achieve  this  increased  throughput  each 
CEF will work one shift on Saturdays and the Brisbane CEF will increase its hours of operation 
to include afternoon shifts Monday to Friday.   

Container Inspection  
Customs screens and risk assesses all import and export cargo and will select around 7% of 
loaded import containers for inspection at the CEFs.  Empty containers and export cargo are 
inspected where there is an identified need to do so.  In addition to the CEFs operations, cargo 
is also subject to examination by Customs at other ports around Australia.  A new smaller CEF 
is being developed in Adelaide and will be operational in early 2005.   

Customs  notifies  its  selections  for  inspection  via  a  ‘hold’  message  in  Customs  Sea  Cargo 
Automation  (SCA)  system  –  “section  74A  clearance  withheld”.    The  status  of  cargo  should

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
and Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 
Agricultural, Veterinary and Industrial Chemicals 

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the PI Regulations) and 
the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (the PE Regulations) relating to the 
control of certain chemicals (the controlled chemicals) were made on 5 August 2004.  The 
amendments commence on 18 August 2004. 

The amendments have been introduced to meet Australia's obligations under the Stockholm 
Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Stockholm Convention) and the Rotterdam 
Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and 
Pesticides in International Trade (Rotterdam Convention). 

The amendments to the PI and PE Regulations complement amendments that have been 
made to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Regulations (the AgVet 
Regulations, now the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Regulations 
1995) and the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Regulations 1990 (the 
Industrial Chemicals Regulations). 

Regulation 5I of the PI Regulations has been amended to introduce a new permission-based 
regime to control the importation of chemicals that are covered by the Stockholm Convention 
and specified in Schedule 9 to the PI Regulations.  Schedule 9 has also been amended to 
add two new chemicals covered by the Stockholm Convention.  The importation of these 
chemicals is similarly controlled under the amended AgVet Regulations where the chemicals 
are imported for agricultural or veterinary use.    

New regulation 4A has been inserted into the PE Regulations to prohibit the exportation, 
without a permission, of a chemical specified in new Schedule 2 to the PE Regulations.  New 
Schedule 2 lists 70 chemicals that are covered by the Stockholm and Rotterdam 
Conventions.  The exportation of these chemicals is similarly controlled under the amended 
AgVet Regulations where the chemicals are exported for agricultural or veterinary use.  

Attachment A lists the chemicals that are being added to the PI and PE Regulations.     

Under the new regimes in the PI and PE Regulations for both the importation and exportation 
of the controlled chemicals, the required permissions will be granted by the Minister for 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (the Minister) or an authorised officer of the Department of 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF). Corresponding permissions to import or to export 
these chemicals granted by the Minister or an authorised officer of DAFF under the AgVet 
Regulations will be accepted for the purposes of the new regimes in the PI and PE 
Regulations.     

Amendments have also been made to the Industrial Chemicals Regulations to ensure that 
Australia's obligations to control the importation and exportation of industrial chemicals 
covered under the Rotterdam Convention are met.  The Rotterdam Convention requires an 
exporter to comply with the importing response of the destination country.  The amendments 
to the Industrial Chemicals Regulations give effect to this requirement, for industrial chemicals 
covered under the Rotterdam Convention.

New Exports Regulations 

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice is to advise industry of formalised reporting 
arrangements for goods intended for exportation and the departure of ships and aircraft. 

A proclamation date has now been set. The items of the Customs Legislation Amendment and 
Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001 (ITM) that will commence on

(cid:131)  reporting goods on delivery to a wharf or airport; and  
(cid:131)  reporting movements and consolidations of prescribed warehoused goods for export. 

Also, the departure of ships and aircraft on or after the cut-over time will be subject to minor 
regulation changes for certificates of clearance.

Permit requirements to import or export Toothfish 

The import and export of fish, or parts of fish, of the species dissostichus eleginoides, commonly 
known as Patagonian toothfish or Chilean Sea Bass, and fish of the species dissostichus 
mawsoni, commonly known as Antarctic toothfish (collectively known as toothfish), are prohibited 
without permission, in writing, under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
(regulation 4BA, Schedule 3A) and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (regulation 
6, Schedule 4) (the regulations).  The prohibition commenced in August 2000 (see Statutory Rules 
Nos 211 and 214 of 2000). 

The regulations prohibit the import or export of toothfish and parts of toothfish whether fresh, 
chilled, frozen, filleted, smoked, preserved in containers, or in any other form unless a permission 
in writing has been obtained from the Minister administering the Fisheries Management Act 1991 
or an authorised officer from the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA).  The 
Minister administering the Fisheries Management Act is the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and 
Conservation.   

A permission is required to import or export any toothfish, this includes the export of 
toothfish that were caught in the Australian fishing zone that have not been landed in 
Australia.  

The toothfish is a threatened species, legally and illegally fished off the southern edge of 
Australia’s continental shelf.  Toothfish are found in the sub-Antarctic waters, including the waters 
around the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands. 

The PI and PE Regulations were introduced as part of Australia’s commitment to the Commission 
for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).  The harvesting of toothfish 
is subject to a wide range of international restrictions placed on landings, transhipments, imports 
and exports. 

The importation of other species of fish may also be subject to permit requirements, under either 
Regulation 4B of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 or under the Environment 
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.  More information on these controls is 
available on the internet at www.customs.gov.au or by contacting Customs Information on 
telephone number 1300 363 263 or via email to information@customs.gov.au. 

Enquiries concerning this notice may be directed to Community Protection on telephone number 
(02) 6275 6114 or via email to community.protection@customs.gov.au. 

Further information on the permit requirements for toothfish can be obtained from AFMA on 
telephone (02) 6272 5029.  To apply for a permit to import or export toothfish, please contact the 
Australian Fisheries Management Authority at PO Box 7051 Canberra Business Centre Canberra

US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff)  
Act 2004 

The US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation (Customs Tariff) Act 2004 (the USFTA Tariff Act) received the Royal Assent on 
16 August 2004, as Act No. 120 and Act No. 121 of 2004, respectively. 

The USFTA Tariff Act contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) to 
implement the duty reductions contained in the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement 
(AUSFTA) by: 

•  providing duty-free access for certain goods and preferential rates of customs duty for 
other goods that are US originating goods in accordance with new Division 1C of 
Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901, imported after the Agreement enters into force; 

•  phasing the above preferential rates of customs duty for certain goods to Free by 2015; 

and 

• 

inserting a regulation making power in the Tariff to prescribe certain footwear that will 
be subject to phasing rates of customs duty. 

Reference should be made to ACN No. 2004/39, which sets out the rules for determining 
whether goods are United States (US) originating goods, for the purposes of AUSFTA. 

The amendments will come into effect when AUSFTA enters into force.  A COMPILE news 
message will be issued to advise the date. 

The introduction of AUSFTA will affect entry procedures for goods from the US.  In particular, a 
new preference code will apply for US originating goods when AUSFTA enters into force. 

Entry procedures for goods from the United States 

•  Where goods meet the AUSFTA rules of origin, the preference code ""U"" should be used 

on Customs entries to access the preferential rate of duty. 

•  Where goods are manufactured in the US, but do not meet the AUSFTA rules of origin, 
the preference indicator ""X"" should be used and the general rate of duty will apply. 

•  Prior to the commencement of the AUSFTA arrangements, amendments will be made 
to the COMPILE computer system that will require importers of goods from the US to 
quote the preference indicator ""X"" on entries.  A COMPILE news message will be 
issued when this change occurs.  (The preference indicator ""U"" will not be available 
until the commencement of AUSFTA). 

The amendments to the Tariff contained in the USFTA Tariff Act provide that a Free rate of duty 
applies to US originating goods, unless a rate is specified in new Schedule 5 opposite the tariff 
classification that applies to those goods.

Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement and Thailand-
Australia Free Trade Agreement - application of preferential rates of 
Customs duty 

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice (ACN) is to clarify when preferential rates of 
customs duty will apply under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) and 
the Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA). 

AUSFTA 

ACN No. 2004/39 stated: “The preferential rates of customs duty will apply to US originating 
goods that are imported into Australia from the day that AUSFTA enters into force”. 

“US originating goods” are defined in the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004, 
and the preferential rates of customs duty to apply to “US originating goods” are specified in the 
US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Act 2004. 

The legislation for the AUSFTA is due to commence on 1 January 2005, when the AUSFTA 
comes into force. 

Goods imported into Australia from the United States of America on and from the 
commencement of the AUSFTA legislation that are “US originating goods” will qualify for the 
preferential rates of customs duty applying under the AUSFTA. 

Goods are considered to be imported into Australia when they are landed or brought within the 
limits of a port with the intention of landing them. 

Goods imported into Australia from the United States of America before the commencement of 
the AUSFTA legislation cannot be “US originating goods”.  Consequently, such goods will be 
subject to general rates of customs duty (paragraph 16(a) of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 
refers).  Such goods will not qualify for the preferential rates of customs duty applying under the 
AUSFTA, even if the goods are entered for home consumption after the commencement of the 
AUSFTA legislation. 

TAFTA 

The customs legislation for the TAFTA is due to commence on the later of 1 January 2005 and 
the day on which the TAFTA comes into force for Australia. 

The customs legislation has been passed by the Parliament and is awaiting the Royal Assent.  
Following the Royal Assent, the Australian Customs Service will issue ACNs on the rules of 
origin and the preferential duty arrangements for the TAFTA. 

Goods imported into Australia from Thailand on and from the commencement of the TAFTA 
legislation that are “Thai originating goods” will qualify for the preferential rates of customs duty 
applying under the TAFTA, subject to certain requirements being met. 

One of those requirements will be that the importer holds a valid Certificate of Origin, or a copy 
of the Certificate of Origin, at the time of claiming a preferential rate of customs duty.

Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement – Customs Tariff 
Amendments 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) 
Act 2004 (the TAFTA Tariff Act) received the Royal Assent on 26 November 2004.  It contains 
amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) to implement the duty reductions 
contained in the Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA) by: 

    providing duty-free access for certain goods and preferential rates of customs duty 
for other goods that are Thai originating goods (in accordance with Division 1D of 
Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901); 

    phasing the above preferential rates of customs duty for certain goods to Free by 

2015;  

creating a new Schedule 6 to the Tariff to accommodate those phasing rates of duty; 
and 

    providing the mechanism to initiate safeguard measures on sensitive products 
including canned tuna, processed pineapple and pineapple juice, if necessary. 

The amendments to the Tariff contained in the TAFTA Tariff Act provide that a Free rate of 
duty applies to Thai originating goods, unless a rate is specified in new Schedule 6 opposite 
the tariff classification that applies to those goods. 

Reference should be made to ACN No. 2004/51, which sets out the rules for determining 
whether goods are Thai originating goods, for the purposes of the Tariff. 

It is expected that the amendments will come into effect on 1 January 2005.  A COMPILE 
news message will be issued when the exact date is confirmed. 

The introduction of the TAFTA will affect entry procedures for goods from Thailand.  In 
particular, a new preference code will apply for Thai originating goods when the TAFTA 
enters into force. 

Entry procedures for goods from Thailand 

    Where goods are Thai originating goods, the preference indicator ""H"" should be used 

on Customs entries to access the preferential rate of duty. 

    Where goods are manufactured in Thailand, but are not Thai originating goods, the 
preference indicator ""T"" should be used where a Developing Country (DCS) rate of 
duty applies. 

    Where safeguard provisions are invoked (see below) preference indicator ""I"" will be 

available for those goods. 

    The preference indicator ""X"" should be used where the general rate of duty applies.

Thailand - Australia Free Trade Agreement - Rules of Origin 

Goods imported into Australia that originate in Thailand will be entitled to preferential rates of 
customs duty on and from the day that the Thailand - Australia Free Trade Agreement 
(TAFTA) enters into force. 

TAFTA is expected to enter into force on 1 January 2005.  A COMPILE message will be issued

Goods will be Thai originating goods if they are wholly obtained goods, and the importer of the 
goods holds, at the time the goods are imported, a Certificate of Origin, or a copy of one, for

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 - 
Dangerous Dogs - Disallowance Motion 

On 30 November 2004, the Senate passed a resolution disallowing the Customs (Prohibited 
Imports) Amendment Regulation 2004 (No. 3) (the Amendment Regulations). 

The Amendment Regulations amended the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the 
PI  Regulations) on 18 June 2004, and introduced regulation 5L to permit the importation of four 
breeds of dangerous dogs for certain scientific purposes. 

The Amendment Regulations also removed the absolute prohibition on importing dogs of those 
breeds from the PI Regulations. 

The disallowance means that from 30 November 2004, regulation 5L ceased to have effect.  

The PI Regulations have now reverted to the former absolute prohibition on the importation of the 
following breeds of dangerous dogs under regulation 3 and item 26 of Schedule 1 to the 
PI Regulations:

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2004) 

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2004) (the Proposal) was tabled in Parliament on 
1 December 2004 and contains a number of alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 
(the Tariff). 

Schedule 1 of the Proposal alters the Tariff to specify that the chemical paraquat dichloride, 
classified to subheading 2933.39.00, may include an emetic added for safety reasons.  
Paraquat dichloride is commonly used as a herbicide. 

By enabling the inclusion of paraquat dichloride with an emetic added for safety reasons in 
subheading 2933.39.00, the same duty outcome of “Free” is achieved as for paraquat 
dichloride that contains other allowable safety measures such as colouring or stenching 
agents. 

This Schedule also substitutes item 22 in Schedule 4 to the Tariff to accommodate changes in 
technology in the oil and gas industries.  The new item reduces the cost of certain goods 
prescribed by by-law and imported for use in the exploration for oil and natural gas, and the 
development of oil and gas wells. 

The above alterations were previously tabled in Parliament in Customs Tariff Proposals 
during 2003.  The alterations were also incorporated as amendments in the Customs Tariff 
Amendment (Paraquat Dichloride) Bill 2004 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Oil, Gas 
and Other Measures) Bill 2004, respectively.  These Bills lapsed with the prorogation of 
Parliament on 31 August 2004.  Customs Tariff Notice No. 1 (2004) was published in 
Special Commonwealth Gazette S 367 on 1 September 2004 to continue the operation of 
these measures, on and from that date.  Schedule 1 of the Proposal is effective from that 
date. 

Schedule 2 of the Proposal amends item 68 in Part III of Schedule 4 to the Tariff to extend 
the SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme. 

On 8 August 2004, the Prime Minister, the Hon John Howard MP, announced that the 
South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement (Textile, Clothing 
and Footwear Provisions) Scheme (the SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme) would 
be extended for seven years, to 31 December 2011, from its current end date of 
31 December 2004. 

The SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme, which commenced on 1 March 2001, provides 
for the duty-free entry of certain textiles, clothing and footwear from Forum Island Countries 
covered by the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement.  The 
Scheme is administered through item 68 in Schedule 4 to the Tariff.  Schedule 2 of the 
Proposal will take effect from 1 January 2005. 

Schedule 3 of this Proposal amends the rates of customs duty applicable to certain alcohol 
and tobacco products specified in a number of items in new Schedule 5 of the Tariff that are 
subject to indexation in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  Schedule 5 sets out rates 
of duty for certain US originating goods, including alcohol and tobacco products, in 
accordance with the provisions of the US Free Trade Agreement.

Changed cargo reporting requirements 

With effect from 13 January 2005, all cargo intended to be landed at any port or airport in 
Australia must be reported before the ship or aircraft arrives at its first Australian port or airport. 

The current requirement to report cargo before the port or airport at which it will be landed is 
being changed by the Customs Legislation Amendment (Airports, Ports and Cargo Security) 
Act 2004 (the amending Act). 

The amending Act will also allow the minimum periods for lodging impending arrival, cargo and 
passenger reports for ships to be prescribed by regulation.  For the time being, the current 
reporting periods of at least: 

•  48 hours before arrival for voyages likely to take 48 hours or more;  and 
•  24 hours before arrival for voyages likely to take less than 48 hours 

will be maintained by regulations which will apply from 13 January 2005. 

Transitional measures for ships arriving on or after 13 January 2005 will continue the old cargo 
reporting requirements where partial reports have been, or were required to be, communicated 
before that date. 

The new requirement to report all cargo before the first port or airport will apply in all other 
circumstances from 13 January 2005. 

As indicated when the legislation was introduced into Parliament, these amendments reflect the 
changing nature of the international trade environment, and provide the flexibility to respond 
more promptly to security issues.

Export reporting for excisable and like customable goods in the 
Integrated Cargo System 

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice is to advise exporters of excisable and “like 
customable” goods of new requirements in reporting the export of these goods in the Integrated 
Cargo System (ICS). Like customable goods are excise equivalent goods that have been 
imported. 

New Export Permission for Excisable Goods 

On 29 June 2004, the Excise and Other Legislation Amendment (Compliance Measures) Act 
2004 came into effect, which introduces new compliance measures on the export of excisable 
goods. One of the new compliance measures is that from 30 December 2004 exporters of 
underbond excisable goods must obtain an export movement permission from the Australian 
Taxation Office (ATO) before they arrange for the goods to be moved to a place of export. 

To assist the ATO in ensuring that underbond excisable goods have the appropriate export 
movement permission, all export declarations lodged through the ICS for excisable goods will 
need to have either a permission number or the appropriate Customs code for duty paid goods. 
All goods subject to excise must show their origin as being Australian. 

Imported goods do not require a permission number in the ICS, unless they have been 
transferred to the excise regime at the time of importation (i.e. goods entered under item 44 of 
schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff).  

An example of how the permission number is entered is shown on page 3 of this notice. 

Exports of duty paid Australian origin products falling to the same classification as excisable 
goods, do not require an export movement permission from the ATO, however the appropriate 
code will need to be entered for excise paid goods as shown on page 3 of this notice. Exporters 
using this code may be asked to demonstrate that the duty has been paid on these goods upon 
request. 

If you are an exporter of excisable goods, and have not yet applied to the ATO for an export 
permission, you should contact 1300657162 or go to www.ato.gov.au for further information. 
Note, however that the Tax Office (including Excise) will be closed between 24 December 2004 
and 3 January 2005. 

Introduction of an Indicator for Prescribed Warehouse Goods 

The introduction of the ICS also included the introduction of new reporting requirements for 
certain excisable and “like customable goods” known as prescribed warehouse goods. These 
goods are primarily tobacco and alcoholic spirits, and are listed in schedule 1AAA of the 
Customs Regulations. 

A new indicator is to be introduced into the ICS from 9 January 2005, to properly identify these 
goods to ensure that appropriate warehouse and depot reporting is undertaken prior to export. 
The new field is referred to as the Prescribed Goods Indicator (PGI).

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2004-61.pdf,Exports implementation update,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2004/61 

Exports Implementation Update 

This notice provides an update of the current state of Exports implementation under Custom’s 
Integrated Cargo System (ICS), which occurred on 6 October 2004.   

During the transition period for the exports implementation a number of technical and business 
process issues were identified which affected a small number of reporters, and short term 
arrangements were put in place to ensure cargo could continue to be exported.  The majority of 
those issues have now been rectified.  

A small number of minor issues are still being addressed and some reporting business rules 
need to be restated. The following is a list of issues that may be currently affecting the reporting 
and movement of export cargo.  

Technical Issues 
The outstanding ICS technical issues still requiring resolution are: 

•  The correct identification of prescribed warehouse goods. The current version of the ICS 
makes the identification reporting of prescribed warehouse goods confusing for some 
exporters, and warehouse and depot operators.  This will be rectified in a new version of the 
ICS, when a new indicator for these goods will be added to the export declaration. This will 
be available on 9 January 2005. 

•  Lack of recognition of Sundays and Public Holidays.  The ICS does not currently recognise 

Sundays and Public Holidays when calculating late reporting of Export Manifests.  This is 
expected to be amended on 19 January 2005 so that manifest reporters receive a warning 
message and manifest do not get an error status under these circumstances. 

•  Slow processing of large messages.  Large messages (that is Export Declarations or 

Manifests that contain a very high number of lines) may be processed slowly by the ICS.  
Customs recommends that clients intending to submit large Declarations or Manifests (over 
100 lines) consider separating such reports into smaller documents in order to obtain faster 
freight clearance. 

•  Missing response messages.  On occasion, clients do not receive response message from 
the ICS.  This is due intermittent interruptions within the Customs gateway and is currently 
being addressed.   
Idle EDN reminder notification.  Some clients are not receiving Idle EDN reminder notices 
due to the way in which their registration is configured within the ICS, particularly in relation 
to outbound message preferences.  Customs is currently looking at options to address this 
issue for those clients.   

• 

Business Process Issues 
Some exporters are experiencing problems with the clearance of their export cargo, when it has 
been reported to Customs by the receiving cargo terminal. Most of these problems stem from 
exporters not following the appropriate reporting rules for cargo, and it is timely that they should 
be restated. The ICS screens export information more extensively than the former EXIT system, 
and identifies a larger number of reporting errors. 

Customs has identified the following scenarios as the most likely reasons for export cargo being 
impeded at a cargo terminal:

Amendment to the Customs Regulations 1926 – Australian exports 
under the Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement 

The Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA) is expected to enter into force on 
1 January 2005.  It will impose certain obligations on people who export goods to Thailand and 
who wish to obtain preferential tariff treatment in respect of the goods, and on people who 
produce such goods. 

Those obligations are contained in amendments to the Customs Regulations 1926 made by 
Statutory Rule No 365 of 2004 and are Customs Amendment Regulation 2004 (No.7) that were 
notified in Special Gazette No. S544 of 23 December 2004.  The purpose of this Australian 
Customs Notice (ACN) is to summarise those obligations.   

Legislation 

The Customs Amendment (Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Act 2004 
inserted a new Division 4C into Part VI of the Customs Act 1901.  Division 4C imposes certain 
obligations on people who export goods to Thailand and who wish to obtain preferential tariff 
treatment in respect of the goods, as well as on people who produce those goods. 

New regulations 105D and 105E of the Customs Regulations 1926 have been made for the 
purposes of Division 4C. 

Record keeping obligations 

Exporter that is not a manufacturer 

Under regulation 105D, an exporter that is not the producer of the goods must keep: 

(a) 

records of the exporter’s purchase of the goods; 

(b) 

records of the purchase of the goods by the person to whom the goods are exported; 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

evidence that payment has been made for the goods; 

evidence of the classification of the goods under the Harmonized System; 

if the goods include any spare parts, accessories or tools that were purchased by the 
exporter: 

(i)  records of the purchase of the spare parts, accessories or tools; and 

(ii)  evidence of the value of the spare parts, accessories or tools; 

(f) 

if the goods include any spare parts, accessories or tools that were produced by the 
exporter: 

(i)  records of the purchase of all materials that were purchased for use or consumption 

in the production of the spare parts, accessories or tools; and 

(ii)  evidence of the value of the materials; and 

(iii)  records of the production of the spare parts, accessories or tools; 

(g) 

if the goods are packaged for retail sale in packaging material or a container that was 
purchased by the exporter: 

(i)  records of the purchase of the packaging material or container; and 

(ii)  evidence of the value of the packaging or container;

Declaration form for SPARTECA and SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) 
Scheme 

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice (ACN) is to advise of a new declaration form 
that can be used when claiming duty-free entry under the South Pacific Regional Trade and 
Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA) or under the SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) 
Scheme (‘the Scheme’), and to remind importers of some of the requirements of the Scheme. 

Extension of the SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme 

Under the Scheme, certain textiles, clothing and footwear from Forum Island Countries that are 
not entitled to duty-free entry under SPARTECA can enter duty free. The Scheme is 
administered through item 68 in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff). 

Item 68 in Schedule 4 to the Tariff has been extended until 31 December 2011 (ACN 
No. 2004/53 refers). 

Terms and conditions of scheme 

Before claiming duty-free entry under the Scheme (or under SPARTECA), an importer is 
expected to be familiar with the requirements that need to be satisfied. The terms and 
conditions of the Scheme are available from the Department of Industry, Tourism and 
Resources at the address referred to below. 

A manufacturer in a Forum Island Country needs to be registered for the Scheme, otherwise its 
goods will not qualify for duty-free entry under item 68.  

A manufacturer wishing to be registered should contact: 

SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme 
TCF Policy Group 
Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources 
GPO Box 9839 
CANBERRA  ACT  2601 
AUSTRALIA 

An importer requires a declaration from the manufacturer in relation to the goods for which 
duty-free entry will be claimed. To facilitate imports from Forum Island Countries, Customs has 
prepared a single declaration that can be used for both SPARTECA and the Scheme. A copy 
of the declaration is at Attachment A.  

Entry requirements 

When claiming duty-free entry under the Scheme, an importer should include the following 
information on the Entry for Home Consumption: 

• 
• 
• 

the treatment code for item 68 (currently 468) 
preference indicator “X” and 
the reference number (know as ELAC ID) on the manufacturer’s declaration in relation to 
those goods. Note: The reference number must be input on the “Goods Description” line 
of the Entry.

Changed cargo reporting requirements 

Australian Customs Notice 2004/55 advised that with effect from 13 January 2005 all cargo 
intended to be landed at any port or airport in Australia must be reported before the ship or 
aircraft arrives at its first Australian port or airport. 

The changed requirements apply to all parties responsible for reporting their arriving cargo.  
Cargo reporters must report the cargo for which they are responsible within the prescribed 
periods. 

In the case of sea cargo, reports must be lodged at least: 

•  48 hours before arrival for voyages likely to take 48 hours or more; and 
•  24 hours before arrival for voyages likely to take less than 48 hours. 

For air cargo, electronic reports must be lodged at least 2 hours prior to arrival at the first 
Australian airport.  Manual air cargo reports must be lodged within 3 hours of arrival at the first 
Australia airport. 

Electronic cargo reporters should continue to report cargo according to current practice, except 
for the new  requirement to report all of their cargo prior to the ship’s or aircraft’s arrival at its 
first Australian port or airport. 

Where a combination of electronic and manual reporting is used, all electronic and manual 
reports must be made within the prescribed period for that type of report (see above) prior to 
arrival at the first Australian port or airport. 

Revised forms are available for manual cargo reporters.  The key changes to the Customs 
Form 1 (sea cargo) and Customs Form 8 (air cargo) are that cargo reporters will be required to 
include information about the port/airport and timing of the ship’s or aircraft’s first arrival, and to 
list all Australian ports or airports of discharge.  The additional information will enable Customs 
to readily determine the compliance of manual reporters with the new reporting timeframe. 

The revised forms are attached and are also available at www.customs.gov.au.

Indexation of certain excise and customs tariff duty rates – 
February 2005 

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff 
Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer (except “home brew”) and 
tobacco increased on 1 February 2005.  The new rates are set out in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the 
Attachment to this Notice.  Note that the rates are applied to goods subject to indexation in new 
Schedules 5 (US originating goods) and 6 (Thai originating goods) (refer Tables 3 and 4 
respectively). 

The new rates of excise and customs duty listed in the Attachment are calculated by multiplying 
the current rates by an indexation factor.  This factor is calculated by dividing the most recent 
index number by the previous highest December or June index number.  Accordingly, the 
December 2004 index number (146.5) has been divided by the June 2004 index number (144.8) 
to establish an indexation factor of 1.012.  As the indexation factor is more than one, current rates 
of excise and customs duty will be increased by the application of this factor.

Notices of Objection to Importation Trade Marks Act 1995 

The  Trade  Marks  Act  1995  allows  the  registered  owner,  or  in  certain  circumstances,  the  authorised 
user  of  a  trademark  to  object  to  the  importation  of  goods  which  infringe  their  trademark.    The 
registered  owner,  or  authorised  user  does  this  by  lodging  a  Notice  of  Objection  with  the  Australian 
Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of 
two years from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices 
of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995.  The Notices notify the objections of these registered 
owners  and  authorised  users  to  the  importation  of  goods  which  infringe  their  trade  mark  or  trade 
marks. Descriptions of the relevant trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of 
goods.  This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 
1995 and along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the 
particular trade mark is registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice 
from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into Australia: 

-  

have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or 
deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

- 

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, 
or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in 
question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the 
trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner 
of the trademark and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade 
mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of 
the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal 
practitioner,  as  to  the  implications  of  the  trade  marks  legislation,  and  the  meaning  of  terms  such  as 
""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

The trade mark owners’ contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers 
who may wish to contact the owner regarding use of the trade marks in question.

1956 and Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 – 
Objectionable Material 

The  following  amendments  to  the  Customs  (Prohibited  Imports)  Regulations  1956  (the 
Prohibited  Imports  Regulations)  and  the  Customs  (Prohibited  Exports)  Regulations  1958  (the 
Prohibited  Exports  Regulations)  were  registered  on  the  Federal  Register  of  Legislative 
Instruments on 28 and 25 February 2005, respectively. 

On  1  March  2005  amendments  concerning  the  provisions  dealing  with  items  of  child 
pornography  and  child  abuse  material  in  section  233BAB  of  the  Customs  Act  1901  (the  Act) 
took  effect.    These  amendments  aligned  section  233BAB  with  similar  amendments  in  the 
Criminal  Code  1995  (the  Criminal  Code).    These  new  provisions  are  more  detailed  and  also 
increase the relevant age of a person from under 16 to under 18.   

Consequential  amendments  have  been  made  to  regulation  4A  of  the  Prohibited  Imports 
Regulations and regulation 3 of the Prohibited Exports Regulations to reflect the change in age.  
Goods will be prohibited imports or prohibited exports if they describe or depict in a way that is 
likely  to  cause  offence  to  a  reasonable  adult,  a  person  who  is,  or  who  appears  to  be,  a  child 
under  18  (whether  the  person  is  engaged  in  sexual  activity  or  not).    These  amendments  also 
commenced on 1 March 2005. 

The  term  ‘looks  like’  has  been  changed  to  ‘appears  to  be’  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  Act 
and the Criminal Code and is not intended to change the substance of the prohibition. 

Such  goods  prohibited  under  the  regulations  may  only  be  imported  or  exported  with  the 
permission of the Attorney-General or an authorised person. 

Inquiries  concerning  this  notice  may  be  directed  to  Manager,  Community  Protection  on 
telephone number (02) 6275 5963 or fax number (02) 6279 3334.

Customs value of Chinese textiles and clothing to include export tax 

Introduction 

On 1 January 2005, the Government of China imposed an export tax on certain textiles and 
clothing.  The export tax is valid for three years. 

The export tax must be paid before the goods are exported from China.  The person or 
company that makes the declaration to Customs in China must pay the export tax.  

Customs value 

In those circumstances where: 

(a) 

the customs value of Chinese textiles or clothing is determined under the transaction 
value method, the most common method of valuing imported goods (refer to section 161 
of the Customs Act 1901); and 

(b) 

the amounts paid or payable by the Australian importer in relation to those textiles or 
clothing include any amount for the export tax, 

the customs value should include the amount paid or payable for the export tax. 

In the above circumstances, the amount paid or payable for the export tax would form part of 
the “price” as defined in subsection 154(1) of the Customs Act 1901.   

The amount of export tax would usually be included in the customs value determined under 
any of the other methods of valuing imported goods, given that there is no provision under any 
of the methods of valuing imported goods for deducting export taxes from the customs value.  
The result is that the customs value should usually include the export tax. 

Where the amounts paid or payable by the Australian importer in relation to Chinese textiles or 
clothing do not include any amount for the export tax (e.g. the exporter pays the export tax but 
does not raise the price of the goods or otherwise require any additional payment from the 
importer due to the export tax), the customs value should not include an amount for the export 
tax.   

Where an importer has paid an amount for the export tax but has not included that amount in 
the customs value of the goods, the importer should lodge a Post Warrant Amendment for 
those goods as soon as possible.  Correction of the customs value and payment of any 
additional customs duty payable before Customs seeks to verify the accuracy of the entry will 
protect the importer from the imposition of penalties (refer to Australian Customs Notice 
No. 2004/05). 

Enquiries 

Any enquiries in relation to this Notice should be directed to the valuation mailbox, 
valuation@customs.gov.au, or to Valuation, Trade Branch on telephone number 
(02) 6275 6556.

Notices of Objection to Importation  
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The  Trade  Marks  Act  1995  allows  the  registered  owner,  or  in  certain  circumstances,  the 
authorised user of a trademark to object to the importation of goods which infringe their trademark.  
The  registered  owner,  or  authorised  user  does  this  by  lodging  a  Notice  of  Objection  with  the 
Australian Customs  Service  (Customs).    Unless  revoked,  a Notice  of Objection  remains  in force 
for a period of two years from the date of commencement.   

The  attached  Schedule  sets  out  the  registered  owners  and  authorised  users  who  have  lodged 
Notices of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995.  The Notices notify the objections of these 
registered owners and authorised users to the importation of goods which infringe their trade mark 
or trade marks. Descriptions of the relevant trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of 
goods.    This  refers  to  the  classes  of  goods  prescribed  in  Schedule  1  to  the  Trade  Marks 
Regulations 1995 and along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods 
for which the particular trade mark is registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek 
further  advice  from  Customs  regarding  the  ambit  of  any  Notice  of  Objection  set  out  in  the 
Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into Australia: 

− 

− 

have  applied  to  them,  or  in  relation  to  them,  a  sign  that  is  substantially  identical  with,  or 
deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

− 

− 

the  goods  are  being  imported  otherwise  than  for  the  purposes  of  trade  (sale,  lease,  hire, 
etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark 
may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the 
mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered 
owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an 
overseas owner of the trademark and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of 
the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People  who  have  been  intending  to  import  goods  that  may  be  liable  to  seizure  under  the 
provisions  of  the  Trade  Marks  Act  1995  should  consider  seeking  advice  from  Customs,  or  a 
suitably  qualified  legal  practitioner,  as  to  the  implications  of  the  trade  marks  legislation,  and  the 
meaning  of  terms  such  as  ""substantially  identical  with"",  ""deceptively  similar  to""  and  ""an 
infringement of"" a trade mark.   

The trade mark owners’ contact particulars have been included in the Schedule to assist importers 
who may wish to contact the owner regarding use of the trade marks in question.

User support service for Customs cargo systems 

Customs will be implementing a revised user support service for Customs cargo systems from 
Monday 4 April 2005. 

The service has been developed to provide a higher quality, more reliable service to users of 
the Customs Connect Facility (CCF), the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) and current import 
systems (pending the introduction of the imports functionality of the ICS mid-2005).  The service 
will provide support for business and systems requests. 

Systems requests are defined as those where the cargo systems are not operating to expected 
standards – for example, slow response times are impacting on the client’s capacity to meet 
business needs/timeframes. 

Business requests are related to assistance with using the functionality of the cargo systems to 
meet business needs/timeframes. 

Customs will provide 24 hours, 7 days a week (excluding national public holidays) support to 
users of cargo systems as follows: 

•  0800 to 1800 (local port time) Monday to Friday – primary hours for business and 
systems support.  All requests for support should, where possible, be raised within 
these hours; 

•  0500 to 2300 (Sydney time) Monday to Friday – Limited staffing in the office outside of 
the primary support hours of 0800 to 1800 (local port time).  Only urgent business and 
systems support requests will be actioned outside of these primary hours of support 
identified above – see definition of urgent below; 

•  0600 to 1400 Saturday and Sunday – Limited staffing in the office to meet urgent 
business and systems support requests.  It is anticipated that these hours may be 
extended closer to the ICS import implementation date; and 

•  Outside of the above hours, urgent systems support requests will be actioned by an on-

call officer. 

All requests for user support are to be made by email to cargosupport@customs.gov.au 
(preferred), by telephone to 1300 558 099 or by fax (see list below).  The only exception relates 
to requests for urgent system support between the hours of 2300 and 0500 where contact is 
restricted to the 1300 558 099 number. 

Fax numbers are: 

•  0800 to 1800 – Monday to Friday (Sydney time) – 02 83396712 or 02 83396713; and 
•  All other times – 02 61225534. 

A request can be classed as urgent if it: 

- 
- 
- 

Endangers the scheduled departure of freight; 
Relates to goods that may perish as a result of delays; or 
Concerns goods that require immediate delivery. 

If  the  request  is  not  assessed  as  urgent,  the  client  will  be  requested  to  email  the 
request, for action to occur during primary hours, or to telephone the 1300 558 099 
number during those hours.

Export cargo reporting requirements  

The introduction of the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) to report the export of goods has implications 
for all involved in the movement of export cargo.  Several issues have arisen since the 
implementation of the ICS, which have caused disruption in the reporting chain.  In particular, a 
significant number of incidents involving incorrect information being provided to stevedores and 
cargo terminals have resulted in delays to Customs reporting and clearance.  

The following information is intended to clarify Customs requirements for reporting export cargo. 

Customs Authority Number 

All goods, other than exempt goods, require a Customs Authority Number (CAN) for export.  A CAN 
may be an Export Declaration Number (for individual export consignments); or a Consolidation 
Reference Number (CRN) - covering several export consignments; or a Transhipment Number. A 
valid CAN identifies a consignment or consolidation for Customs purposes as goods pass through 
the export process.  The CAN should pass through that process with the export goods and be 
provided to the party the goods are given to when export goods are delivered for consolidation, 
passed to a freight forwarder for packing, or delivered directly to a cargo/container terminal operator 
or stevedore. 

Consolidated Cargo – Submanifest reporting  

Consolidators of export cargo must communicate a submanifest to Customs setting out the 
information required by the approved statement for submanifests.  Details of any EDNs, other CRNs, 
exempt codes and transhipment numbers for all consignments included in a consolidation must be 
included in the submanifest. 

Failure to lodge a submanifest for consolidated export cargo is a strict liability offence under section 
117A of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act).    

Lodging a submanifest that includes false or misleading information (or omits information without 
which the submanifest is false or misleading) is a strict liability offence under section 243U of the 
Customs Act.  However, the correction of such errors before Customs exercises a power to verify the 
content of a communication will provide protection from liability for an offence (see Australian 
Customs Notice 2004/05). 

Delivery to a wharf or airport for export - Consolidated Cargo  

After a consolidator of cargo for export has lodged with Customs a submanifest reporting all 
consignments included in a consolidation, Customs will issue a Consolidation Reference Number.  
The CRN must be presented at the time the goods are delivered to a wharf or airport for export.  
Failure to do so may result in the CTO or stevedore receiving a message of “Do Not Load” and the 
goods not being accepted for export. 

It is a strict liability offence under section 114E of the Customs Act to deliver goods entered for 
export to a wharf or airport without: 

•  an authority to deal being in force; and 
•  giving the stevedore or CTO prescribed particulars in writing (including details of a valid 
CRN, Australian Business Number, transhipment number, bill of lading or air waybill).

Tariff Concession Orders – Changes to duty rates 

The Government has announced the removal of the three percent customs duty that previously 
applied to business inputs imported under a Tariff Concession Order (TCO).  The measure will 
take effect from 11 May 2005 and applies to all imported goods, subject to a TCO, and entered 
for home consumption on, or after, 11 May 2005. 

Legislation 

In order to implement the change, Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (2005) (the Proposal) was 
tabled in Parliament on 10 May 2005.  The Proposal amended the Customs Tariff Act 1995 
(Customs Tariff), to remove the three percent customs duty on goods that are business inputs 
and are subject to a TCO.  In summary, the Proposal: 

•  Amended Item 50 to Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff, to provide that goods, subject to 
a TCO, and entered for home consumption on, or after, 11 May 2005, will attract a free 
rate of duty; 

•  Also amended provisions within Item 50 that apply to goods imported under tariff 

classification 3819.00.00; 

•  Removed Item 50A to Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff, which previously provided for 
the importation of consumption goods, subject to a TCO, at a free rate of duty; and 

•  Amended Item 19 to Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff, to apply a free rate of duty to the 
cost of materials, labour and other charges associated with goods, subject to a TCO, 
that are repaired overseas and subsequently returned to Australia.   

Transitional Arrangements 

There are currently decisions pending on a number of applications for TCO.  In addition, 
Customs has on-hand a number of requests for the revocation of TCOs and TCO decisions 
subject to internal review.  Where the result of the relevant decision is that a TCO will have 
applicability both before and after 11 May 2005, different rates of duty will apply.   

The three percent customs duty will apply to all goods subject to a TCO, if they are entered for 
home consumption before 11 May 2005.  Goods, subject to a TCO and entered for home 
consumption on, or after, 11 May 2005, will attract a free rate of duty. 

Further Information 

Customs has issued a COMPILE Broadcast Message in relation to these changes.  Inquiries 
concerning this notice may be directed to Director, Tariff Concessions on telephone number 
(02) 6275 6095 or fax number (02) 6275 6376.

Customs broker initiated contingency print release 

The purpose of this notice is to advise of important changes concerning Broker Initiated 
Contingency Releases. 

Background 

In October 1997, Customs provided in the COMPILE system the ability for Customs Brokers to 
initiate the release of cargo, known as ""print contingency release"", in specific circumstances.  

These arrangements were intended for use under the following circumstances: 

•  when there were significant delays or a complete failure to transmit the SCA release to 

container terminals and container depot operators; or 

•  when technical problems experienced by container terminals and container depot 
operators prevented or significantly delayed the receipt of the SCA release. 

The contingency release print-out can only be generated by COMPILE: 

• 

• 

if at least 2 hours has elapsed since the original advice authorising release of the cargo 
was transmitted to the container terminal or depot operator; and 
If an authority to deal in the goods has been granted under the provisions of s.71B of 
the Customs Act 1901. 

Despite the limitations noted above, the use of Broker initiated contingency releases has 
become extremely common in some locations.  The result is that it has created an opportunity 
for fraudulent usage in a small number of cases.   

Increased emphasis on border security and the potential risk to revenue posed by the continued 
use of Broker initiated contingency release printouts has resulted in Customs reviewing the 
manual COMPILE mechanism for the release of cargo.  The danger to the community through 
the risk of illegal imports of prohibited goods and breaches of counter terrorism measures that 
could occur as a result of the unauthorised release of cargo is unacceptable.   

New Arrangements 

Effective from 1 June 2005, Customs Brokers, Container Terminal Operators (CTO) and Depot 
Operators are advised that the COMPILE created “print contingency release” printout has no 
authority by Customs for the release of cargo.  Furthermore, Customs will disable the feature in 
COMPILE that provides for “print contingency release” to be created.  

Moving goods without Customs authority is an offence under section 33 of the Customs Act 
1901.  The Infringement Notice Scheme (INS) applies to offences against section 33, with a 
maximum penalty of twelve penalty units. A penalty unit is defined by subsection 4AA(1) Crimes 
Act 1901. 

Detailed below are procedures to be followed by clients where status advice is required outside 
of that provided through Customs cargo systems.

related matériel to all foreign and Congolese armed groups and militia groups operating in 
certain territories of the DRC. 

UNSC Resolutions 1556 and 1591 oblige States to take steps to prevent the supply of arms and 
related matériel to all non-government entities and individuals and the Government of Sudan 
operating in certain states of Sudan. 

UNSC Resolution 1572 obliges States to take steps to prevent the supply of arms and related 
matériel, in particular aircraft and equipment, to Cote d’Ivoire. 

As a result, Regulations 13CL (DR Congo), 13CM (Sudan), and 13CN (Cote d’Ivoire) of the 
Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 have been introduced with effect from  
27 May 2005.  These regulations prohibit the export of arms and related matériel to these 
countries without the written permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 

Arms and related matériel are defined in Regulation 2 of the PI Regulations as including (a) 
weapons; (b) ammunition; (c) military vehicles and equipment; (d) paramilitary equipment; and, 
(e) spare parts for the things mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (c).   

Paramilitary equipment is also defined in Regulation 2 as any of the following: (a) batons, clubs,

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2005-23.pdf,International transport and insurance and the value of the taxable importation,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2005/23 

International transport and insurance and the value of the taxable 
importation 

This Notice provides guidelines to assist owners and their customs brokers in establishing the 
transport and insurance elements of the value of the taxable importation (VoTI). It supplements 
GST Ruling 2003/15 (“Importation of goods into Australia”) that was issued by the Australian 
Taxation Office (ATO) on 10 December 2003. Paragraphs 260 to 273 in that ruling deal with 
transport and insurance issues. Australian Customs Notice 2000/35 has been superseded by 
that Imports Ruling and is hereby withdrawn. 

In a self assessment environment it is the owner’s responsibility to establish and declare the 
amount paid or payable for the international transport of the goods to Australia and to insure the 
goods for that transport. Customs requires accurate reporting of this transport and insurance 
information in order to establish the correct GST liability for imported goods. 

What is the VoTI? 
Goods and Services Tax (GST) is levied on imported goods at 10% of the value of the taxable 
importation (VoTI). Section 13-20 in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 
(GST Act) – copy included on the last page of this notice - provides that the VoTI is the sum of:  

• 
• 

the customs value of the goods; 
the amount paid or payable for the international transport of the goods to their place of 
consignment in Australia and to insure the goods for that transport; 

•  any customs duty payable; and 
•  any wine tax payable. 

Place of consignment 
“International transport” is defined in section 195-1 of the GST Act. In relation to the importation 
of goods it means: 

“… the transport of the goods from a place outside Australia to their place of 
consignment in Australia (excluding loading and handling within Australia)”. 

“Place of consignment” is also defined in section 195-1 to mean: 

“(a) if the goods are posted to Australia – the place in Australia to which the goods are 

addressed; or 

(b) in any other case – the port or airport of final destination as indicated on the 

transportation document”. 

Paragraphs 261 to 267 in GST Ruling 2003/15 provide guidance in relation to these terms. 
Paragraph 264 of that ruling indicates that the Taxation Commissioner accepts that goods 
weighing less than 31.5 kilograms that are transported to Australia and delivered “door-to-door” 
by an international express courier service (or similar door-to-door courier) are “goods posted to 
Australia”.

Cheese and curd tariff quota - Allocations for 2005-2006 

The Australian Customs Service (Customs) will shortly be advising importers of their allocation 
of cheese and curd quota for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006.  

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of the quota by that importer in 
the 23-month period ending 31 May 2005, as shown in Customs’ records of clearances for 
home consumption, where ‘clearance’ is deemed to have occurred at warranting or finalisation 
in EFT.  The 23-month period has been chosen to reflect the most recent use of quota by 
importers.  

This calculation excludes any part of the quota that was transferred to another importer 
during the 23-month period or that was unused as at 31 May 2005.  

Importers are reminded that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the 
quota allocated importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese 
or curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of 
that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian 
goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 
(the Tariff), preference circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), quota is unable to 
be used. 

 The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if:  

(a)  
(b)  
or airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged.  

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs; and  
the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port 

If both conditions are not met by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, 
the goods will be taken to have been ‘entered for home consumption’ in the following financial 
year.  

In such circumstances, the goods are either entered:  

- 

- 

under quota for the following financial year (if the importer has sufficient quota for 
that year); or  

without concession at the rate of customs duty applicable to the relevant 
subheading of Schedule 3 of the Tariff.

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2005) 

Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2005) (the Proposal) was tabled in Parliament on 
23 June 2005 and contains a number of alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff). 

The Proposal amends Additional Note 3(a) to Chapter 22 in Schedule 3 of the Tariff by 
inserting a 22% upper limit on alcohol content of ‘grape wine’ defined by the Note. This 
amendment aligns the definition of wine, for the purposes of the Tariff, with the definition set 
out in the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 and its Regulations.  Any 
locally manufactured wine that does not fall into that definition is excisable.  This amendment 
will ensure that imported wine of fresh grapes, that does not comply with the revised 
Additional Note, will attract customs duty at the same rate as the excise duty on similar locally 
manufactured product. 

The Proposal also inserts, in tariff subheadings 2206.00.30 and 2206.00.4, references to 
Additional Note 4 to Chapter 22.  Additional Note 4 defines ‘grape wine product’ for the 
purposes of the Tariff.  Grape wine product includes certain wine based cream beverages, 
generically described as ‘Irish Cream’.  When imported into Australia, these goods are subject 
to excise equivalent rates of customs duty, while similar goods manufactured in Australia are 
subject to the Wine Equalisation Tax (WET).   

The reference to Additional Note 4 in the above tariff subheadings will correct this anomaly 
and allow ‘Irish Cream’ to be classified in either subheading.  This will mean that these 
products will be subject to the WET and applicable rates of customs duty. 

Tariff reprint pages, Chapter 22/1 (R.4) and Chapter 22/13 (R.12), to reflect the above 
changes will be available in the week commencing 27 June 2005.

Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) 
Protection Act 2005 

Introduction 

This is a guide to the operation of the Customs seizure provisions of the Melbourne 2006 
Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2005 (the Act) and is intended for 
the owners and authorised users of the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (the Games) 
indicia and images.  The Act came into effect on 26 June 2005 and ceases to have effect on  
30 June 2006. 

The Act establishes a legislative scheme to permit the owner of material bearing the Games 
indicia and/or images, or an authorised user, to object to the importation of goods which 
allegedly infringe their usage of these indicia and/or images for commercial purposes.  It is 
recommended that persons considering lodgement of a Notice of Objection discuss the matter 
with their legal advisers before proceeding with the Notice. 

The Act is designed to prevent the unauthorised commercial use of certain indicia and images 
associated with the Games, in order to provide a more secure environment in which the 
Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Corporation can raise revenue through sponsorship 
and can prevent ambush marketing.  

Customs is working closely with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Corporation and 
will ensure that only authorised licence holders are able to import merchandise with the 
approved logos and associated markings. 

1. Outline 

Section 20 of the Act establishes a scheme for lodging a Notice of Objection in respect of 
these goods and section 21 of the Act empowers Customs to seize such goods pending 
resolution of an action brought by the objector as to whether the importation of the goods 
infringes notified indicia and/or images. 

2. The Legislative Scheme - Seizure Provisions 

Section 21 of the Act provides that where: 

(a)  goods manufactured outside Australia have been imported into Australia and are 

subject to the control of Customs; and 

(b)  the imported goods have had applied to them Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games 

indicia and/or images; and 

(c)  there has been given to Customs a Notice in writing objecting to the importation of 

goods that have applied to them Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games indicia and/or 
images, in respect of the imported goods; and 

(d)  the goods, in the opinion of Customs, have applied to them Melbourne 2006

authorised by the Act to use for commercial purposes;

The Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) is compiled by the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and is based on the six digit international Harmonized 
System developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO) for describing internationally 
traded goods. 

The AHECC is designed for use by exporters, customs brokers and freight forwarders for the 
classification of goods when providing export declarations to the Australian Customs Service, 
and to assist users in the interpretation of export statistics published by the ABS.  The AHECC is 
normally updated on 1 January and 1 July each year. 

The January 2005 issue is the latest version of the AHECC.  However, as no changes to the 
AHECC are required, a July 2005 issue of the AHECC will not be released. The January 
2005 issue is therefore still current. 

Copies of the entire AHECC and previous AHECC updates are available from the ABS web 
site free of charge.

Tariff Concession Orders - application requirements 

On 11 May 2005, the three percent customs duty levied on imported  business inputs eligible for a Tariff 
Concession Order (TCO) was removed.  The response to the change in duty rate has been a marked 
increase in TCO applications.  Many of these applications are being lodged by new participants in the 
Tariff Concession scheme.  To assist these new participants, Customs has identified some of the critical 
aspects in preparing an application for a TCO. 

LODGING A TCO APPLICATION 

To lodge a TCO application with Customs, section 269F of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) requires 
that the: 

“…application must: 
(a)  be in writing; 
(b)  be in an approved form; and 
(c)  contain such information as the form requires; and 
(d)  be signed in the manner indicated in the form.” 

The following information is provided to clarify some of the requirements for successfully lodging a TCO 
application. 

‘Approved’ Application for a Tariff Concession Order (B443) forms are available: 

via the Customs Internet website at  
www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/B443_0106.pdf ; 
at any Customs office; or  
via post upon request to any Customs office.   

All application forms must be complete and accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation.  
Incomplete or insufficiently supported applications will be rejected.   

To ensure applications are not rejected, particular attention should be paid to the following areas: 

Description of Goods - a physical description of the goods must be provided.  The description 
should be phrased positively and in generic terms but should not state what the goods do, or their 
end use. 

For example:  PARTS, PUMP, being ANY of the following: 

(a) rings; 
(b) impellors; 
(c) casings 

Illustrative Material - applications must be accompanied by illustrative descriptive material (IDM) 
that clearly identifies the goods.  IDM can take any form.  It may include samples, CD-ROMs, 
brochures, data sheets and schematic diagrams. 

Tariff Classification - all applications must include an eight-figure tariff classification for the 
goods.  Tariff classifications are codes given to all imported goods that determine the rate of duty 
levied on those goods.  It is recommended that applicants seek the assistance of a customs

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2005-31.pdf,Commencement of 96 hour Pre-Arrival Reporting,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2005/31 

Commencement of 96 hour Pre-Arrival Reporting 

On 26 April 2005 Customs advised industry that from July 2005 vessel pre-arrival and 
passenger and crew reporting would be required 96 hours in advance of a vessel’s arrival.  It 
was also the intention that shorter periods would be prescribed depending on the length of the 
voyage. 

Since the date of that advice the Minister for Justice and Customs has agreed with industry to 
seek a longer transitional period for the purposes of the Integrated Cargo System (ICS).  The 
cut-over to the ICS is now planned to be 12 October. 

In examining the legislative implications of this transitional period it is now apparent that 
requiring 96 hour pre-arrival reporting from July 2005 would need a series of amendments to be 
made to the Customs Regulations.  In view of this Customs believes that matters will be 
simplified for industry if 96 hour pre-arrival reporting becomes effective from 12 October 2005.  

A fact sheet on the ICS transitional arrangements is available at www.customs.gov.au, following 
the links to the CMR pages. 

Customs is examining the forms currently used to supply vessel and crew pre-arrival 
information.  Some rationalisation is necessary to ensure Customs continues to receive reports, 
on vessels in particular, required by it and other Government Departments.  You will appreciate 
that information required on a vessel (such as ISPS and levy information) is substantially 
different from the information being collected through the (ICS) Sea Impending Arrival Report 
and the (ICS) Sea Actual Arrival Report.   A further Australian Customs Notice will be issued 
giving details of a national simplified requirement. Until then the current Impending Arrival 
Report must still be lodged. 

It is important to note that the Sea Impending Arrival report cannot be lodged in the ICS any 
earlier than 10 days before the expected arrival of the vessel. 

For those companies reporting the Sea Actual Arrival Report on or after the cut-over date, the 
current arrival report, Form 5 Part One, will no longer be required to be lodged manually.  From 
12 October the manual lodgement of this form will cease.

Notices of Objection to Importation - Trade Marks Act 1995 

The  Trade  Marks  Act  1995  allows  the  registered  owner,  or  in  certain  circumstances,  the 
authorised user of a trademark to object to the importation of goods which infringe their trademark.  
The  registered  owner,  or  authorised  user  does  this  by  lodging  a  Notice  of  Objection  with  the 
Australian Customs  Service  (Customs).    Unless  revoked,  a Notice  of Objection  remains  in force 
for a period of two years from the date of commencement.   

The  attached  Schedule  sets  out  the  registered  owners  and  authorised  users  who  have  lodged 
Notices of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995.  The Notices notify the objections of these 
registered owners and authorised users to the importation of goods which infringe their trade mark 
or trade marks. Descriptions of the relevant trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of 
goods.    This  refers  to  the  classes  of  goods  prescribed  in  Schedule  1  to  the  Trade  Marks 
Regulations 1995 and along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods 
for which the particular trade mark is registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek 
further  advice  from  Customs  regarding  the  ambit  of  any  Notice  of  Objection  set  out  in  the 
Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into Australia: 

− 

− 

have  applied  to  them,  or  in  relation  to  them,  a  sign  that  is  substantially  identical  with,  or 
deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

− 

− 

the  goods  are  being  imported  otherwise  than  for  the  purposes  of  trade  (sale,  lease,  hire, 
etc.); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark 
may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the 
mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered 
owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an 
overseas owner of the trademark and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of 
the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People  who  have  been  intending  to  import  goods  that  may  be  liable  to  seizure  under  the 
provisions  of  the  Trade  Marks  Act  1995  should  consider  seeking  advice  from  Customs,  or  a 
suitably  qualified  legal  practitioner,  as  to  the  implications  of  the  trade  marks  legislation,  and  the 
meaning  of  terms  such  as  ""substantially  identical  with"",  ""deceptively  similar  to""  and  ""an 
infringement of"" a trade mark.

Ammonium nitrate Import and Export controls 

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (PI Regulations) and the 
Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (PE Regulations) relating to security sensitive 
ammonium nitrate (SSAN) commenced on 23 July 2005. 

As part of its national review of the regulation, reporting and security around the storage, sale 
and handling of hazardous materials, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) identified 
a number of means to limit opportunities for the illegal or unauthorised use of hazardous 
materials.  Many of these materials have legitimate use in industry, mining, agriculture, and 
scientific research, and therefore the COAG recommendations have been framed to balance 
the legitimate needs of users with the need for regulation and control. 

As a result, COAG agreed to a set of principles to ensure that ammonium nitrate is only 
accessible to persons who can demonstrate a legitimate need.  States and Territories agreed to 
implement a licensing regime for the manufacture, transport, storage, supply, use, and import 
and export of SSAN.  State and Territory legislation will provide for regulatory authorities to 
administer licensing regimes to control access to SSAN.  It is intended that a nationally 
consistent regime be in place in all States and Territories by mid-2006. 

The Commonwealth’s role in the regulation and control of access to SSAN is to control the 
importation into, and exportation from, Australia of SSAN.  The PI Regulations and PE 
Regulations have been amended to fulfil this role.   

New regulation 4X of the PI Regulations prohibits the importation into Australia of SSAN unless 
permission for the importation has been granted by an authority of the State or Territory where 
the SSAN is to be located after importation.  Customs has made arrangements to advise State 
and Territory authorities about the importation of SSAN even where the local controls have not 
yet been introduced. 

New regulation 9AC of the PE Regulations prohibits the exportation of SSAN from Australia 
unless permission for the exportation has been granted by an authority of the State or Territory 
where the SSAN is located before exportation.  Customs will also advise the State and Territory 
authorities of the exportation of SSAN even where the local controls are not yet in place. 

SSAN is defined as ammonium nitrate, an emulsion of ammonium nitrate that is made up of 
more than 45 per cent ammonium nitrate, and a mixture of ammonium nitrate that is made up of 
more than 45 per cent ammonium nitrate, but does not include a solution of ammonium nitrate.  
A solution of ammonium nitrate is ammonium nitrate dissolved in water.  

Importers and exporters of SSAN who operate in more than one State or Territory where controls 
are in place will need to have the relevant permission issued by an authority of each of those States 
and Territories through which the SSAN is imported or exported, in order to satisfy the new 
Customs regulations. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to the Manager, Weapons & Strategic Goods, 
Cargo Branch, on telephone number (02) 6275 6189 or fax number (02) 6275 6699.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2005-37.pdf,Updated - Moratorium relating to strict liability import offences,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2005/37 

Updated - Moratorium relating to strict liability import offences 

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) replaces ACN No. 2005/34 issued 21 July 2005.  
ACN No. 2005/34 referred to 12 April 2005 as the end of the extended moratorium period 
when it should have read 12 April 2006. 

The administrative moratorium in relation to the Infringement Notice Scheme (INS) is being 
republished.  The key change involves giving industry the original intended benefit of a full 
6 months moratorium on infringement notices and prosecutions for the new import offences. 

The extension of the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) cut-over period from 40 days from 
commencement of the imports related legislation to 12 October 2005 would have effectively 
used up 3 months of both the administrative and statutory moratoriums for the INS import 
related offences. 

The attached moratorium document details how the moratorium will apply to the INS import 
related offences.  The extended moratorium began on 19 July 2005 and will run until 6 months 
after the 12 October 2005 cut-over time, i.e. until and including 12 April 2006. 

The statutory moratorium on mandatory electronic reporting of cargo reports (under section 
64AB of the Customs Act 1901) will not be extended.  Therefore, a cargo reporter lodging 
documentary cargo reports who requires additional time to be able to report electronically will 
still need to apply for an extended moratorium period under that section. 

The statutory moratorium on serving infringement notices and commencing prosecutions for late 
reports under section 64AB will apply for the 6 months from 19 July 2005 or until the end of any 
further moratorium period granted to an individual cargo reporter. 

For cargo reporters who do not require an extension of time to be able to report electronically, in 
addition to the statutory moratorium on infringement notices and prosecutions for offences 
against section 64AB(10), an administrative moratorium will apply until 6 months after the import 
cut-over time. 

Customs response to non-compliance with import requirements will be determined by the extent 
and nature of the non-compliance in accordance with the “Customs Regulatory Philosophy” and 
the “Guidelines for Serving Infringement Notices”.  The issuing of infringement notices is not 
automatic but is an option available to Customs, considering the circumstances on a case-by-
case basis. 

The Customs Regulatory Philosophy and the Chief Executive Officer’s Guidelines for Serving 
Infringement Notices are available on the Customs Internet site at www.customs.gov.au.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2005-38.pdf,Indexation of certain excise and customs tariff duty rates – August 2005,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2005/38 
Indexation of certain excise and customs tariff duty rates – 
August 2005 

In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff 
Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on spirits, beer (except “home brew”) and 
tobacco increased on 1 August 2005.  The new rates are set out in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the 
Attachment to this Notice.  Note that the rates are applied to goods subject to indexation in new 
Schedules 5 (US originating goods) and 6 (Thai originating goods) (refer Tables 3 and 4 
respectively). 

The new rates of excise and customs duty listed in the Attachment are calculated by multiplying 
the current rates by an indexation factor.  This factor is calculated by dividing the most recent 
index number by the previous highest December or June index number.  Accordingly, the 
June 2005 index number (148.4) has been divided by the December 2004 index number (146.5) 
to establish an indexation factor of 1.013.  As the indexation factor is more than one, current rates 
of excise and customs duty will be increased by the application of this factor.

Import Cargo Reporting - Self Assessed Clearance (SAC) 
Thesaurus 

The purpose of this notice is to advise importers of the clearance arrangements for imported 
sea or air cargo goods with a value at or below the entry threshold (currently $250).  These 
arrangements will apply to goods that are scheduled to arrive in Australia on or after the  
cut-over date for the Integrated Cargo System – that is, 12 October 2005. 

SAC Declarations 

Under the Integrated Cargo System, cargo reporters will be able to self-assess the type of 
import clearance process that applies to imported goods valued at or below the entry threshold.  
There are three types of SAC declarations.  The two most common types are the cargo report 
SAC and the SAC (short form) declaration.  The nature of the goods being imported will 
determine the type of SAC to be used.   

SAC Thesaurus 

Customs (in conjunction with industry) has developed a list of terms to assist those completing 
import cargo reports to determine the appropriate form of SAC declaration.  The list is known as 
the SAC Thesaurus and covers alcohol and tobacco products, prohibited or restricted goods.  
These are goods that either require the payment of duties and taxes (irrespective of the value of 
the goods) or are subject to an import restriction or condition (such as quarantine) under 
Commonwealth law. 

Cargo reporters are able to declare that the imported goods are low value and that the 
description does not match any of the terms in the SAC Thesaurus.  In these cases, the cargo 
reporter may tick an indicator on the cargo report, which will signify that it is also a cargo report 
SAC declaration.   

Alternatively, goods falling within the categories described in the SAC Thesaurus will require the 
lodgement of a separate SAC declaration by the owner.  SAC declarations can be 
communicated only electronically to Customs.  There are no manual or documentary lodgement 
options available. 

The SAC Thesaurus has been disseminated with the latest update of the software developer’s 
guide (SDG).  It is also available on the Customs website, through the following link: 
http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/SACThesaurus_050725.pdf    

Any  subsequent  amendments  to  the  SAC  Thesaurus  will  also  be  updated  through 
the SDG and the Customs website.  Further information about SAC declarations is 
available  on  Customs  website  at  www.customs.gov.au  (by  following  the  links  from 
‘cargo management re-engineering’). 

Inquiries concerning  this notice may  be  directed  to the  Manager,  Import  Policy  on  telephone 
number (02) 6229 3500 or fax number (02) 6245 5446.

Notices of Objection to Importation 
Copyright Act 1968 

The Copyright Act 1968 allows the owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, to object to 
the importation of goods that infringe copyright.  The owner of the copyright, or the exclusive 
licensee, does this by lodging a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service 
(Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two years 
from the date of commencement.    

The attached Schedule sets out the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, who have 
lodged a Notice of Objection under the Copyright Act 1968 since August 2004 (ACN 2004/17).  
The Notices notify the objections of the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, to the 
importation of goods that infringe their copyright. A description of where copyright is claimed is 
also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available at 
http://cww.customs.gov.au/internet/site/page4497.htm. 

Goods identified by Customs at the border as potentially infringing copyright are liable to be 
seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, 
hire, etc); or 
the goods do not infringe the copyright. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the 
provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a 
suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the copyright legislation. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the 
capital city of each State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further 
information regarding the Notices of Objection, or Customs’ role in respect of those Notices, 
should contact the Customs Information and Support Centre on 1300 363 263 or the

Notices of Objection to Importation 
Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) 
Protection Act 2005 (Cth) 
The Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2005 (the Act) 
prevents the unauthorised commercial use of certain indicia and images associated with the 
Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games, in order to provide a more secure environment in 
which the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Corporation can raise revenue through 
sponsorship and prevent ambush marketing. 

The Act allows the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Corporation (the Corporation) and 
persons authorised by the Corporation, the Australian Commonwealth Games Association and 
the Commonwealth Games Federation (authorised users), to object to the importation of goods 
where the designated owner of the goods is not authorised by the Act to use, for commercial 
purposes, goods that have had Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games indicia or images 
applied to them.   

Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection will remain in force until the Act ceases to have effect on 
30 June 2006, or in the case of an authorised user (other than the ACGA or the CGF) on the 
day on which the authorisation ceases to have effect.    

Section 8 of the Act provides that indicia or images are applied to goods if they are: 

•  woven in, impressed on, worked into, affixed or annexed to, the goods; or 

•  applied to any covering, document, label, reel or thing in or with which the goods 

are, or are intended to be, dealt with or provided in the course of trade; or 
•  are used on a signboard or in an advertisement (including a television or radio 

advertisement) that promotes the goods; or 

•  are used in an invoice, price list, catalogue, brochure, business letter, business 

paper or other commercial document that relates to the goods. 

Section 21 of the Act allows the CEO of Customs to seize infringing goods if: 

•  a Notice of Objection is in force under section 20 in relation to the goods; and 

• 

it appears to the CEO of Customs that the designated owner is not authorised by 
the Act to use the indicia or images for commercial purposes in relation to the 
goods. 

However, under section 21 of the Act the CEO of Customs is not required to seize infringing 
goods if:

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 
1956 – Crossbows 

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
(the Regulations) commenced on 10 August 2005.  

Item 18C of the Regulations restricts the importation of crossbows.  The item previously 
restricted the importation of only pistol crossbows (excluding toy crossbows) designed to be 
used with one hand and capable of causing damage to property or bodily harm.  

The Australasian Police Ministers’ Council has resolved that, to ensure consistency across 
State, Territory and Commonwealth legislation in relation to the regulation of crossbows, all 
jurisdictions would prohibit all crossbows, not only pistol crossbows.  

Consequently, item 18C of the Regulations has been amended to remove the reference to 
“pistol crossbows”, so that all crossbows, except toy crossbows, are captured.   

The importation of these goods is prohibited unless the permission of the Minister for Justice 
and Customs or an authorised person has been granted. 

The intention of the amendment to item 18C of Schedule 2 is to give the Commonwealth the 
power to compliment State and Territory legislative controls on crossbows.  

Inquiries  concerning  this  notice  may  be  directed  to  the  Manager,  Weapons  and  Strategic 
Goods on telephone number (02) 6275 6189 or fax number (02) 6275 6699.

Alteration of the import cut-over time and International Trade 
Modernisation (ITM) import related regulation changes 

The Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Act 2005 (the Amendment Act) 
received the Royal Assent on 24 August 2005 as Act No 105 of 2005. 

The Amendment Act changes the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International 
Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Act 2004: 
• 

specifying 2am (AEST) on 12 October 2005 as the import cut-over time for the Integrated 
Cargo System; and 

•  making consequential amendments to the provisions relating to the import turn-off time for 

the cargo legacy systems. 

The Amendment Act gives effect to the Government’s commitment that there would be a 
suitable transition period to allow for business readiness. 

On Friday 19 August 2005, the Customs Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 5) - No. 186 of 
2005 - were registered in accordance with the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. 

The Amendment Regulations change the Customs Regulations 1926 by repealing redundant 
provisions, updating legislative and system references and inserting new regulations prescribing 
matters required by provisions of the ITM amended Customs Act. 

The Amendment Regulations also include the new 96hr timeframes applicable to impending 
arrival (and consequently crew) and passenger reports for ships. 

While the Amendment Regulations have commenced, transitional provisions postpone the 
application of the changes until required by provisions of the ITM amended Customs Act. 

To view the Amendment Act or Regulations, visit the Attorney General’s Department’s ComLaw 
website (http://www.comlaw.gov.au).  The relevant reference numbers are C2005A00105 and 
F2005L02003, respectively.  Unlike Regulations, Explanatory Memoranda for Acts are located 
with the related Bills.  The Bill can be found using ComLaw’s browse facility.

Cargo System (ICS) - Imports“ fact sheet available on the Customs CMR website.

Commencement of 96 hour Pre-Arrival Reporting for Ships, Crew 
and Passengers  
and Revised Forms and Arrangements  

Australian Customs Notice No 2005/31 refers. 

Nothing in this Notice impacts on cargo reporting arrangements nor on passengers and crew 
arriving by air.   

From 12 October 2005 the following timeframes will apply to reporting ships, crew and 
passengers on ships at first port of arrival in Australia: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

If the voyage from last port is longer than 96 hours reports must be made not later than 
96 hours in advance of arrival 

If the voyage from last port is less than 96 hours reports must be made not later than 72 
hours in advance of arrival 

If the voyage from last port is less than 72 hours reports must be made not later than 48 
hours in advance of arrival 

If the voyage from last port is less than 48 hours reports must be made not later than 24 
hours in advance of arrival 

If the voyage from last port is less than 24 hours reports must be made not later than 12 
hours in advance of arrival.   

The attached Form 13 will be the national standard form for reporting vessel pre-arrival 
information. 

Form 3A for crew reporting is now obsolete.  Attached is a revised Form 3B for crew reporting. 
The data elements sought bring this manual report into the same format as that required by the 
Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs for its Advanced Passenger 
Processing initiative for cruise and commercial vessel crew.  

However, until amendments to the Migration Act are made, the Department of Immigration, 
Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs’ crew and passenger pre-arrival reporting deadline of 48 
hours, which applies to international passenger cruise ships, will remain in force. Customs and 
DIMIA will work closely with the cruise shipping industry to ensure requirements are understood 
and that inadvertent breaches of Customs legislation do not result in penalties being imposed. 

These forms will be made available on the Customs internet site at www.customs.gov.au. They 
will be available in Word format and thus can be e-mailed to Customs, if preferred over 
facsimile.  Addresses for each port are attached to this Notice.  The forms may be used from the 
time they are available to you and for all reporting from 12 October 2005.   

In addition, ships carrying cargo must lodge an Impending Arrival Report in the Integrated 
Cargo System within the timeframes described above.  This electronic report contains different 
information to those documentary reports detailed in this Notice.  The electronic Impending 
Arrival Report is essential to obtain clearance for cargo.

Notices of Objection to Importation  
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The  Trade  Marks  Act  1995  allows  the  registered  owner,  or  in  certain  circumstances,  the 
authorised  user  of  a  trademark  to  object  to  the  importation  of  goods  which  infringe  their 
trademark.  The registered owner, or authorised user does this by lodging a Notice of Objection 
with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains 
in force for a period of two years from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged 
Notices of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since August 2005 (ACN 2005/41).  The 
Notices notify the objections of these registered owners and authorised users to the importation 
of  goods  which  infringe  their  trade  mark  or  trade  marks.  Descriptions  of  the  relevant  trade 
marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available at 
www.customs.gov.au/site/page?cfm?u=4683. 

For each particular trademark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” 
of  goods.    This  refers  to  the  classes  of  goods  prescribed  in  Schedule  1  to  the  Trade  Marks 
Regulations  1995  and  along  with  a  description  of  the  goods,  is  used  to  describe  the  type  of 
goods  for which  the  particular  trade  mark  is  registered.    Prospective  importers  of such goods 
should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out 
in the Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to manufactured outside and imported into Australia: 

− 

− 

have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or 
deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

− 

− 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, 
etc); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark 
may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where 
the  mark  in  question  has  been  applied  to,  or  in  relation  to,  goods  with  the  consent  of  the 
registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the 
consent  of,  an  overseas  owner  of  the  trademark  and  the  goods  are  imported  into  Australia 
without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People  who  have  been  intending  to  import  goods  that  may  be  liable  to  seizure  under  the 
provisions  of  the  Trade  Marks  Act  1995  should  consider  seeking  advice  from  Customs,  or  a 
suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the 
meaning  of  terms  such  as  ""substantially  identical  with"",  ""deceptively  similar  to""  and  ""an 
infringement of"" a trade mark.

Changes to Item 50A – Consumption goods 

The purpose of this ACN is to advise that there have been changes to the administrative list of  
‘consumption  goods’  attached  to  Item  50A  of  Schedule  4  of  the  Customs  Tariff  Act  1995  (the 
Tariff).   

Item  50A  provided  for  the  concessional  entry,  with  a  ‘Free’  rate  of  Customs  duty,  of  certain 
goods identified as ‘consumption goods’. 

Item  50A  in  the  Tariff  refers  to  United  Nations  Statistical  Papers,  Broad  Economic  Categories 
(BEC) and Standard International Trade Classification (SITC).  These documents define those 
classifications that are ‘consumption goods’ for the purposes of Item 50A. 

It has been brought to Customs attention that certain changes to the BEC occurred in February 
2003, and that those changes had not been reflected in the administrative table attached to Item 
50A  in  the  working  tariff.      As  a  consequence  affected  parties  may  be  eligible  for  a  refund  of 
duty, and/or may be subject to recovery action where duty has been short levied. 

The changes involve: 

(a)  Certain classifications changing to that of ‘consumption goods’; and 

(b)  Certain  classifications  that  were  ‘consumption  goods’  changing  to  that  of  non-

consumption goods.   

As a consequence, during the period February 2003 to 10 May 2005, certain goods that should 
have attracted a duty rate of ‘Free’ due to the changes in paragraph (a), attracted a rate of 3%; 
and certain goods that should have attracted a duty rate of 3% due to the changes in paragraph 
(b), attracted a rate of ‘Free’. 

The change does not impact on goods entered for home consumption on or after 11 May 2005, 
as Item 50A was repealed with effect from that date, as part of the 2005/06 Budget. 

In particular, attention is drawn to the limitation in time applicable to applications for refunds and 
any recovery action by Customs.  

Refunds - goods that should have been considered ‘consumption goods’  

Subsection  163(1)  of  the  Customs  Act  1901  (the  Act)  provides  for  the  making  of  refunds, 
rebates  and  remissions  of  duty  in  such  circumstances,  and  subject  to  such  conditions  and 
restrictions, as are prescribed. 

Under  sub  regulation  128A(4B)  of  the  Regulations,  an  application  for  a  refund  of  duty  in  a 
circumstance  specified  in  paragraph  126(1)(r)  must  be  made  within  12  months  after  the  date 
upon which one of the specified events occur, whichever happens last.  The specified event for 
the  purposes  of  this  matter  is  the  date  on  which  the  particular  goods  were  entered  for  home 
consumption. 

Paragraph 126(1)(r) of the Regulations provides that a refund of duty is payable where:

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations - 
protective jackets, vests, suits and body armour 

The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 have been amended to clarify controls on 
protective jackets, vests, suits and body armour.  The amendment to Item 29A of Schedule 2 of 
the Regulations was registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments on 11 
November 2005. 

Item 29A of Schedule 2 of the Regulations previously imposed import controls on protective 
jackets and vests, body armour, and other articles of apparel, that were designed to resist the 
penetration of a projectile discharged from a firearm. 

The amended Item 29A now controls the importation of body armour, protective jackets, 
protective vests, protective suits, anti-ballistic articles or any other similar articles that are able 
to be worn, either independently or as part of something else, on the human body and that are 
designed or adapted to protect the human body from the effects of a weapon.  Anti-ballistic 
articles used for eye or hearing protection are excluded from the new restrictions. 

The new Item 29A includes articles that are designed to protect against non-deforming 
fragments emitted from explosive devices as well as projectiles discharged by firearms.  The 
amendment also captures articles that are designed to protect the body from the effects of a 
weapon, including knives, so it covers stab-proof vests. Parts for these protective articles are 
also restricted, for example, the anti-ballistic plates designed to fit in protective jackets.

Integrated Cargo System - Changes to Administrative 
Arrangements for Concessional Items in Schedule 4 and Other 
Tariff Related Changes 

There are a number of changes for declaring imported goods scheduled to arrive on or after the 
cut over date, of 12 October 2005, in the Integrated Cargo System (ICS), to treatment codes, 
use of concessional items, units of quantity and country codes.  These are set out below. 

Treatment Codes 

A number of concessional items in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 currently use 
nominal tariff classifications, commencing with the numbers 9999, to give administrative effect 
to the item in the Customs COMPILE Computer System.  On commencement of the ICS, some 
of these numbers will be replaced with treatment codes.  The Table below lists the affected 
items and the 9999 reference numbers and the replacement treatment codes. 

The new treatment codes will operate in the same way as existing treatment codes, that is, 
importers will be required to quote on ICS Import Declarations the tariff classification under 
Schedule 3 that applies to the goods.  When a treatment code is also quoted, the treatment 
code will provide the rate of duty specified in the item that applies to the goods. 

Tariff working pages for Schedule 4 and the Supplementary Provisions will be reprinted prior to 
the commencement of the ICS, to reflect the above changes. 

Please note that the new treatment codes are NOT operative in the COMPILE System and 
importers should continue using the relevant 9999 reference numbers. 

Use of Concessional Items  

The ICS will not accept Import Declarations where a Schedule 4 concessional item is used 
when the duty rate is equal to or greater than the duty rate that applies under  
Schedules 3, 5 or 6. 

Units of Quantity 

Statistical Codes for a number of tariff classifications, particularly in Chapter 44 (wood 
products), use the abbreviations “M2” and “M3” for square metres and cubic metres, 
respectively.  In the ICS, these abbreviations have been replaced with “SM” and “CU”, 
respectively, and these units of quantity should be used on Import Declarations.  Units of 
quantity can be found by selecting the icon provided on the Import Declaration. 

Tariff Working Pages printed for 1 July 2005 incorporated these changes, where required.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2005-52.pdf,Authorized Agents - Declaration of Places,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2005/52 

Authorized Agents - Declaration of Places 

Section 181 of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) deals with the authorization of agents who may 
act on behalf of the owner of goods for the purposes of the Customs Act. An authorized agent 
may act on behalf of the owner in relation to many requirements of the Act. The most common 
of these is in relation to making import declarations for imported goods.  However, under section 
181(2) of the Act at certain places declared by the CEO of Customs, only an employee of the 
owner or a licensed customs broker can be an authorized agent for the purposes of the 
Customs Act at that place. 

In 1981, Notice No. 80 was published in the Australian Government Gazette declaring the 
places in Australia for the purposes of subsection 181(2) of the Act.  These places were 
generally the capital cities of the States and Territories of Australia.  Outside of those places 
there was no restriction on who may act as an agent. 

Since that notice was published in the Gazette, there have been a number of changes to 
business practice and information technology, such as widespread use of the internet, 
electronic lodgment and Electronic Funds Transfer, which have reduced the need for importers 
to employ a wide range of agents.   

The Australian Customs Service has now registered on the Federal Register of Legislative 
Instruments a new notice declaring all places in Australia as places for the purposes of 
subsection 181(2) of the Act.  Once the new declaration takes effect, at all places in Australia 
only a licensed customs broker or an employee of the owner of the goods will be able to be 
authorized as an agent of the owner, for example, for the purposes of making import 
declarations.  This does not restrict the arrangements for the making of export declarations or 
the ability of owners of goods to act in their own right. 

In May 2005, Customs advised those it could identify as affected of the intention to make this 
declaration. 

This notice will take effect from the import cut-over time, as defined in section 4 of the Customs 
Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) 
Act 2004, which is expected to be 12 October 2005.

The purpose of this Notice is to clarify the information, or knowledge, required by an Australian

Grounds for Claiming Preference 

There are product-specific rules of origin that need to be met for goods to qualify for a 
preferential rate of customs duty under the AUSFTA.  Information on those rules of origin is 
available at: http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/html/pastereg/3/1857/top.htm. 

The information that an importer needs to substantiate a claim for a preferential rate of customs 
duty depends on the rule of origin that applies to the good that is being imported. 

An importer needs to know exactly which product-specific rule of origin applies to the good that 
is being imported.   

The Australian Customs Service (Customs) will not be satisfied that an importer has sufficient 
information, or knowledge, where the importer knows only that the good is made in the USA or 
that the good is the product of the USA. 

Documentary Requirements 

An importer is entitled to claim a preferential rate of customs duty without any written advice, at 
the time of importation. 

However, Customs suggests that an importer obtains written confirmation (i.e. in an email, 
facsimile or letter) of any oral advice provided by a US manufacturer/producer of a good.  The 
advantage of written advice is that it will be much easier for an Australian importer to 
demonstrate, when audited by Customs, that a good meets a rule of origin under the AUSFTA 
and, therefore, qualifies for a preferential rate of customs duty.   

Customs may require an importer to submit a statement setting forth the reasons why a good 
meets a particular rule of origin.  Customs may also seek to verify that a good meets a particular 
rule of origin by requesting information from the US manufacturer/producer or exporter of the 
good.   

Customs may deny a preferential rate of customs duty where the importer, manufacturer/ 
producer or exporter does not provide information that demonstrates that the good meets the 
rules of origin. 

(i) 

Certificate of Origin 

A certificate of origin is not required under the AUSFTA.  However, if a certificate of origin has 
been obtained by the importer, Customs will accept it as prime facie evidence that the good 
meets a rule of origin under the AUSFTA, provided that the certificate of origin: 

•  has been issued by the US manufacturer/producer of the good; and 
specifies which product-specific rule of origin applies to the good.    
•

Formal import entry and revenue collection thresholds in the ICS 

On 8 October 2005, the Customs Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 6) - No. 230 of 2005 – 
and Customs By-laws Numbers 0540003 and 0540004 will commence. 

Entry/declaration 
The Amendment Regulations prescribe a value of $1,000 for subparagraph 68(1)(f)(iii) of the 
Customs Act 1901.  This means that goods imported other than by post, that is by sea and air 
cargo, that have a value not exceeding $1,000 will not have to be the subject of a formal 
import entry.  This amendment aligns the threshold value of such goods with those imported 
into Australia by post. 

Revenue liabilities 
New Customs By-laws Numbers 0540003 and 0540004 apply the ‘Free’ duty rate under Item 
32A or 32B of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to a consignment of goods imported 
into Australia if the customs value does not exceed $1,000.  Section 42-5 of the A New Tax 
System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 specifies that if these goods are duty free, they 
are also non-taxable importations.  As with the By-laws they replace (Numbers 0040019 and 
0040020, which have been revoked), the new By-laws specifically exclude consignments 
containing tobacco, tobacco products or alcoholic beverages.  This means that duty and tax 
must be paid on these products, irrespective of value. 

By increasing the formal entry threshold for air and sea cargo from the levels established 
in 1975, and directly aligning the formal entry and revenue collection thresholds, the 
Government intends to simplify the customs clearance process for a large number of 
importers of low value goods. 

Application provisions within the regulations and the by-laws apply the new formal entry and 
revenue collection thresholds to goods due to arrive at or after the import cut-over time for the 
Integrated Cargo System that is planned for 12 October 2005. 

The amendment regulations and by-laws can be viewed on the Attorney General’s 
Department’s ComLaw website (http://www.comlaw.gov.au). 

For queries concerning this ACN, please contact the Manager, Legislation and Development 
by phone on 02 6275 5977 or by fax on 02 6245 5446.

Item 47 to Schedule 4 – Removal of 3% Customs Duty 

Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 4) 2005 (the Proposal) was tabled in Parliament on 
13 October 2005.  The Proposal contains an amendment to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to 
remove the 3% customs duty that applies to goods the subject of item 47 in Part III of 
Schedule 4.  This amendment applies to goods entered for home consumption on or after 
11 May 2005. 

Importers who have used item 47 since that date are entitled to a refund of customs duties.  To 
facilitate the refund process, a new treatment code of 547 has been allocated to item 47 and will 
provide a Free rate of duty from 11 May 2005.  Please note that the existing item 47 treatment 
code of 447 will be discontinued and will not be available for use in Compile or the ICS. 

Affected parties are encouraged to apply for refunds as soon as possible as external access to 
COMPILE will cease under the ICS transition arrangements.  After that time, documentary 
refund applications will be required. 

For advice on refund application procedures, contact your Regional Refunds and Import 
Processing areas.

manual process ie. original documents are physically submitted to the ‘Lodgements’ area in 
each region. There may also exist the option of lodging documents to a dedicated fax machine, 
where agreement has been reached with the relevant regional Customs office.  

To simplify and harmonise customs procedures, Customs wishes to advise of an additional 
option to facilitate the lodgement of ‘redline’ documents. This new option will be available from 
Monday, 28 November 2005.  

New Option: 

Where clients are required to submit ‘Redline’ documents, they may email them to the relevant

Special safeguards on Tuna from Thailand 

By Notice published in the Commonwealth Gazette on 20/10/2005, the Minister for Agriculture 
has imposed special safeguards on imports of tuna. The provisions relate to tuna classified 
under Tariff Heading 1604.14.00.   

The effect of the provisions is that all tuna imported from Thailand will attract the general rate of 
duty from 21/10/2005 until 31 December 2005 (Preference Scheme “GEN” in ICS, or 
Preference Code“X” in COMPILE), unless “in-transit” provisions apply (Preference Scheme 
“THSS” in ICS, or Preference Code “I” in COMPILE). Please also refer to ACN 2005/27 for more 
information on claiming preferential rates of duty in the ICS. 

Importation occurs upon ""the bringing of goods into a port with an intention to land them at that 
port, or an action which actually results in the goods being landed”. 

To qualify for “in-transit” provisions, the goods must meet the requirements of being Thai 
originating, have a valid Thai Certificate of Origin at time of importation, and be exported from 
Thailand on or before 20/10/2005, under a contract entered into on or before 20/10/2005. 

The safeguards will cease to apply to goods imported on or after 1 January 2006, but may be 
re-imposed if the limit of 22,434,591 Kgs is reached in 2006.  Preference Scheme “TH” will 
apply in the ICS, or Preference Code “H” in COMPILE  (If applicable), to goods imported on or 
after I January 2006, until that limit is reached.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 - 
dangerous dogs 

The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the Regulations) have been amended to 
prohibit absolutely the importation of dogs of the breed Perro de Presa Canario or Presa Canario.  
The breed has been added to Item 26 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations.   

Item 26 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations lists breeds of dogs the importation of which is prohibited 
absolutely.  The following breeds of dog are listed in Item 26: 
• 
(cid:129) 
(cid:129) 
(cid:129) 
(cid:129) 

dogo Argentino  
fila Brasileiro  
Japanese tosa  
American pit bull terrier or pit bull terrier 
Perro de Presa Canario or Presa Canario 

The amendments have effect from 16 November 2005 inclusive. 

The breed (otherwise known as the Canary Dog) originated in Spain and was originally bred for 
organised fights.  Through breeding, it has become an extremely game, powerful and able fighting 
animal. 

In November 2004, the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare (NCCAW) 
recommended to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry that the breed be added to 
Schedule 1 to the Regulations.  The NCCAW advises the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and

Concessional treatment for goods imported by non-Australian 
Commonwealth Games family members for the Melbourne 2006 
Commonwealth Games 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Commonwealth Games) Act 2005 received Royal Assent on 
8 November 2005 as Act No. 131 of 2005. 

This Act amends item 64 in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff) to 
provide duty free and GST exempt entry for non-commercial goods imported by non-Australian 
Commonwealth Games Family members for use in, or for purposes related to, the Melbourne 
2006 Commonwealth Games.  This concession will operate for a period of six months from 
1 January 2006 to 30 June 2006.  A similar concession was available for the Sydney 2000 
Olympic and Paralympic Games. 

Goods that qualify for entry under the new concession are non-commercial goods and include 
such items as give-aways, hospitality samples and other consumables that will be used for team 
promotion and for cultural and hospitality activities. 

A new By-law No. 0540005 has been created for the purposes of item 64 to further define 
eligible goods. 

The by-law specifically excludes: 

•  motor vehicles and vehicle parts; 
•  alcoholic beverages and tobacco products; 
• 

transmission apparatus and systems for radio-broadcasting or television and parts 
thereof, including outside broadcasting units and studio equipment; 
television cameras for television studios or for reporting; and  
television and radio-broadcasting mixing and editing equipment. 

• 
• 

A new By-law No. 0540006 has also been created for the purposes of item 15 in Schedule 4 to 
the Customs Tariff (Passenger Concessions) for goods imported as accompanied baggage by 
non-Australian Commonwealth Games Family members. 

A new treatment code 355 has been created for Commonwealth Games goods to which section 
162A of the Customs Act 1901 applies (Supplementary Provisions item 111A refers). 

Tariff reprint pages to reflect the new concession and associated by-laws are being issued with 
this Notice.  These documents will also be available on the Australian Customs website. 

Intending importers of the above goods should also be aware of the provisions relating to the 
use of certain indicia and images associated with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games.

Parts of vessels and materials for use in the construction, 
modification and repair of vessels 
Concession Item 42 – Schedule 4 Customs Tariff Act 1995 

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) is provided as a guide for importers and Customs 
brokers seeking to use Item 42 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff).  
This notice replaces all previous advice and ACN’s relating to Item 42, including ACN 98/71. 

Introduction 

Item 42 provides assistance to the Australian ship building industry by reducing input costs 
to shipbuilders through the concessional admission of vessel parts and materials.  The 
concession applies to: 

""Parts of vessels, and materials, for use in the construction, modification 
and repair of vessels exceeding 150 gross construction tons as defined in 
the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989."" 

The application of the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989 is limited solely to the calculation for “gross 
construction tons”.  In accordance with subsection 4(3) of the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989, the 
number of tons in the gross construction tonnage of a vessel shall be ascertained in 
accordance with the formula: 

Z / 2.83 

Where Z is a number equal to the number of cubic metres in the total volume, measured in 
relation to their moulded lines, of the enclosed spaces in the vessel, including between-deck 
spaces, water ballast spaces, voids, cofferdams, machinery spaces, erections, 
superstructures, houses, casings, funnel spaces, mast spaces and, in the case of an air-
cushion vehicle, the area enclosed by the inflatable skirt under normal inflation. 

Guidelines 

In order to qualify for a concession under Item 42, it is a legislative requirement that all 
goods are initially classified under their substantive classification in either Schedule 3, 5 or 6 
of the Tariff.  Importantly, goods are ineligible to claim access to Item 42 if they are 
classified to a tariff classification in Schedule 3, 5 or 6, which attracts a “free” rate of duty. 

Item 42 may only be claimed on a consignment-by-consignment basis.  Importers must 
comply with the specific terms, conditions and requirements of the concession.  To gain 
access to Item 42, importers must be able to demonstrate that their goods meet three 
criteria. 

These criteria are: 

(i) 
(ii) 

(iii) 

That the goods are parts of vessels and/or materials for use in vessels. 
That the goods are intended for use solely in the construction, modification and 
repair of vessels. 
That the vessel involved exceeds 150 gross construction tons.

trademark.  The registered owner, or authorised user does this by lodging a Notice of Objection 
with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains 
in force for a period of two years from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged 
Notices of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since September 2005 (ACN 2005/48).  
The Notices notify the objections of these registered owners and authorised users to the 
importation of goods, which infringe their trade mark or trade marks. Descriptions of the relevant 
trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available at 
http://cww.customs.gov.au/internet/site/page4387.htm 

For each particular trademark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of 
goods.  This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks 
Regulations 1995 and along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the type of 
goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  Prospective importers of such goods 
should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out 
in the Schedule. 

Where goods of the kind referred to are manufactured outside and imported into Australia: 

− 

− 

have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or 
deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the Schedule; and  

fall within a class of goods for which the relevant trade mark is registered,  

they are liable to be seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

− 

− 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, 
etc); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark 
may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where 
the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the 
registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the 
consent of, an overseas owner of the trademark and the goods are imported into Australia 
without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the 
provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a 
suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the 
meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an 
infringement of"" a trade mark.

Reporting of containers left on wharves 

This Notice deals with the reporting of containers that remain on wharves for 7 days or more 
after the date of arrival (‘extended periods’). Regular reporting of these containers is considered 
essential to minimise potential security risks. 

It should be noted that the reporting arrangements suggested in this Notice are a minimum. 
Where existing reporting arrangements, agreed between the Australian Customs Service 
(Customs) and a stevedore, provide for more frequent reporting and/or reporting of containers 
left on the wharf for a period less than 7 days, those arrangements will continue to apply.  

Minimum Standard 

Customs requests that from Monday, 6 February 2006, stevedores periodically provide a report 
of all containers that remain on their wharves for 7 days or more after the container’s date of 
arrival. 

Reports should contain the following details: 

•  Terminal Name (eg. P&O PORTS) 

•  Period (Week) Ending (eg. Monday 23/1/06 and Thursday 26/1/06) 

• 

• 

International Vessel ID and Name  

International Voyage Number 

•  Date Of Arrival 

•  Container Number  

•  Establishment ID 

•  Shipping Company

Item 50A – Demands for the recovery of short levied duty/GST  

The purpose of this ACN is to advise that in response to a number of representations and 
following the receipt of further advice, Customs has reviewed its position on letters of demand 
issued in relation to changes to Item 50A of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995.  As a 
consequence, Customs has decided to cease undertaking recovery action in relation to this 
matter.   

Item 50A provided for the concessional entry, at a free rate of Customs duty, of certain goods 
identified as consumption goods. 

As advised in ACN 2005/49, Item 50A referred to certain United Nations Statistical Papers, 
which defined the tariff classifications that were considered to be consumption goods.  These 
United Nations Statistical Papers were amended in early 2003, however, the resulting changes 
to the list of consumption goods were not made to the administrative table attached to Item 50A 
in the working tariff. 

Customs will be writing to all affected importers who have been issued with a letter of demand 
in relation to this matter.  For those importers who have not paid their letter of demand, no 
further action will be required. 

For those affected importers who have paid all, or part, of the short levied duty and GST, 
Customs will return any monies paid and will be seeking a signed deed of release and 
indemnity.  

Refunds  will  continue  to  be  paid  in  accordance  with  requirements  set  out  in         
ACN 2005/49. 

Inquiries  concerning  this  notice  may  be  directed  to  Director  –  Tariff  Policy  on  telephone

Updates to the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity 
Classification - 1 January 2006 

The Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) is compiled by the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and is based on the six-digit international harmonized 
system developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO) for describing internationally 
traded goods. 

The AHECC is designed for use by exporters, customs brokers and freight forwarders for the 
classification of goods when providing export declarations to the Australian Customs Service, 
and to assist users in the interpretation of export statistics published by the ABS. The 
classification is normally updated on 1 January and 1 July each year. 

The ABS has finalised the changes required for the 1 January 2006 AHECC updates. These 
changes affect the Key of changes and some codes in Chapter 08. 

The 1 January 2006 updates will be available from the ABS website from 16 December 2005. 
Copies of the entire AHECC and previous AHECC updates will also be available from the web 
site at the same time, free of charge. In addition, a completely updated web-readable version of 
the AHECC will be available. 

To access these documents, users should go to the ABS website www.abs.gov.au and select 
Themes, International Trade, AHECC. To download the current or previous AHECC 
replacement pages, follow the links under the heading ‘AHECC replacement pages’. If a 
complete AHECC is required, follow the link ‘AHECC January 2006 issue’ under ‘Complete 
AHECC’.

Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940 - labelling requirements for 
chinaware 

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice is to clarify requirements for labelling of imported 
chinaware1 as prescribed by the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 (the Act) and 
Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940, (the regulations) and supersedes the requirements for 
labelling set out for chinaware in Australian Customs Notice 2002/44. 

Regulation 7(1)(j) of the regulations requires that a trade description be placed on imported 
china, porcelain, earthenware and enamelled hollowware of the following kinds:  

(i) 

(ii) 

articles of a description commonly used in connexion with the serving of food or 
drink for man; and  
kitchenware and kitchen utensils.   

The trade description to be applied to such goods is set out in Regulation 8 of the regulations 
and is as follows.   

The trade description must be in the form of a principal label or brand affixed in a prominent 
position and in as permanent a manner as practicable to the goods. (This means that for 
chinaware, the trade description on chinaware must be permanent, that is, indelible print, 
etching or under the glaze, and the trade description is to be applied on each individual item.) 

The trade description must include the name of the country in which the goods were made or 
produced.   

If the trade description on the goods includes a weight or quantity, it must also say if that weight 
or quantity is net or gross.   

Any other information included must not contradict or obscure the required trade description.  
This includes illustrations, wording or size of lettering.   

The trade description must be in English. 

Requirements for chinaware imported for sale as pre-packed items 

Where items referred to in r.7(1)(j) of the regulations are imported in the packaging in which 
they are to be sold, the trade description must be applied to the individual items in the package. 
(Previously, where items were imported in this way Customs took the view that the regulations 
permitted the trade description to be applied to the packages in which they were offered for 
sale.)   

Other Requirements 

The Act prohibits the importation of goods that bear a false trade description.  A false trade 
description means a trade description which, by reason of anything contained therein or omitted 
therefrom, is false or likely to mislead in a material respect as regards the goods to which it is 
applied, and includes every alteration of a trade description, whether by way of addition, 

1 Chinaware includes items listed in Regulation 7(1)(j) of the Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940.

Indexation of certain excise and Customs tariff duty rates - February 
2006 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December Quarter 2005 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 25 January 2006.  In accordance with the indexation provisions of the 
Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties 
on spirits, beer (except “home brew”) and tobacco increased on 1 February 2006.  The new 
rates are set out in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Attachment to this Notice.   

The new rates of excise and customs duty listed in the Attachment are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, i.e. the December Quarter 2005 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
December 2005 index number (150.6) has been divided by the June 2005 index number 
(148.4) to establish an indexation factor of 1.015.  As this factor is more than one, rates of 
excise and customs duty have been increased by the application of the factor.

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the 
authorised user of a trademark to object to the importation of goods which infringe their 
trademark.  The registered owner, or authorised user does this by lodging a Notice of Objection 
with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged 
Notices of Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since December 2005 (ACN 2005/69).  
The Notices notify the objections of these registered owners and authorised users to the 
importation of goods, which infringe their trade mark or trade marks.  Descriptions of the 
relevant trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=493 

For each particular trademark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of 
goods.  This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks 
Regulations 1995 and along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the type of 
goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  Prospective importers of such goods 
should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out 
in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and 
are subject to the control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark 
may, or may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where 
the mark in question has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the 
registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the 
consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark and the goods are imported into Australia 
without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the 
provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a

Notices of Objection to Importation - Copyright Act 1968 

The Copyright Act 1968 allows the owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, to object to 
the importation of goods that infringe copyright. The owner of the copyright, or the exclusive 
licensee, does this by lodging a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service 
(Customs). Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two years 
from the date of commencement. 

The attached Schedule sets out the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, who have 
lodged a Notice of Objection under the Copyright Act 1968 since August 2005 (ACN 2005/40). 
The Notices notify the objections of the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, to the 
importation of goods that infringe their copyright. A description of where copyright is claimed is 
also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Copyright Notices of Objection is available at: 
http://cww.customs.gov.au/internet/site/page4497.htm

Goods identified by Customs at the border as potentially infringing copyright are liable to be 
seized by Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 

- 

the goods are being imported other than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, 
etc); or 
the goods do not infringe the copyright. 

People who are intending to import goods that may potentially be liable to seizure under the

suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the implications of the copyright legislation. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the 
capital city of each State and Territory. Importers, or their advisers, who require further

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
Mini-cup Jelly Confectionery 

The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the PI Regulations) have been amended 
to include ‘mini-cup jelly confectionery’ containing the ingredient konjac on the list of prohibited 
imports in Schedule 12.  Under regulation 4U of the PI Regulations the importation of goods 
listed in Schedule 12 is prohibited unless permission in writing is given by the relevant Minister 
to import the goods.  Schedule 12 sets out goods which are subject to a permanent ban 
imposed under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (the TP Act). 

The amendments insert new item 11 into Schedule 12 prohibiting the importation of certain jelly 
confectionery products, including products marketed using the expression “mini-cup”, containing the 
ingredient ‘konjac’ (otherwise known as glucomannan, conjac, konnyaku, konjonac, taro powder 
and yam flour) and having a height or width of less than or equal to 45mm. 

The definition of “Minister” contained in subregulations 4S(5) and 4U(4) of the PI Regulations has 
also been amended.  “Minister” was previously defined as the Minister administering Part V of the 
TP Act.  However, under the current Administrative Arrangement Orders, there are two Ministers 
administering Part V.  The amendments now make it clear that it is the Treasurer (or the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer or the Assistant Treasurer) who must give permission to 
import the goods.  It does so by defining “Minister” as the “Minister administering Division 1A of Part 
V of the TP Act” (which is the Division which allows the Minister to impose a permanent ban upon 
the supply of certain goods).

Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940 - labelling requirements for 
chinaware 

ACN 2006/01 provided updated requirements for labelling of imported chinaware1 as prescribed 
by the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 (the Act) and Commerce (Imports) Regulations 
1940, (the regulations). This notice supersedes ACN 2006/01.  

The  requirements  for  labelling  outlined  in  ACN  2006/01  are  not  substantially 
changed by this ACN. However, following representations from a number of Industry 
groups,  the  options  for  labelling,  and  the  date  for  compliance  enforcement  have 
been reviewed and adjusted. 

The following information sets out the revised requirements for labelling chinaware. 

Regulation 7(1)(j) of the regulations requires that a trade description be placed on imported 
china, porcelain, earthenware and enamelled hollowware of the following kinds: 

(i) 

(ii) 

articles of a description commonly used in connexion with the serving of food or 
drink for man; and  
kitchenware and kitchen utensils.   

The trade description to be applied to such goods is set out in Regulation 8 of the regulations 
and is as follows. 

The trade description must be in the form of a principal label or brand affixed in a 
prominent position and in as permanent a manner as practicable to the goods.  The 
trade description must include the name of the country in which the goods were made 
or produced.   

The most permanent way to mark chinaware is in indelible print, etching or under the glaze. 
Where this is not practicable, Customs will also accept high quality adhesive labels that are of a 
durable nature, do not obscure any other markings, and will remain on each item until the goods 
are past the point of retail sale. 

If the trade description on the goods includes a weight or quantity, it must also say if that weight 
or quantity is net or gross. 

Any other information included must not contradict or obscure the required trade description.  
This includes illustrations, wording or size of lettering. 

The trade description must be in English. 

Requirements for chinaware imported for sale as pre-packed items 

Where items referred to in r.7(1)(j) of the regulations are imported in the packaging in which 
they are to be sold, the trade description must be applied to the individual items in the package.  

1 Chinaware includes items listed in Regulation 7(1)(j) of the Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940.

Customs Broker Licensing – Approved Courses of Study 

This Australian Customs Notice is to provide potential applicants for a customs broker licence 
with information regarding the approved courses of study. 

Background 

Applications for a broker’s licence must be made in accordance with the requirements of the 
Customs Act 1901 (the Act).  Among other things, the Act requires that the Chief Executive 
Officer of Customs (the CEO) grant a broker’s licence only if, in his opinion, the applicant is 
qualified to be a customs broker.  A qualified customs broker must: 

(1)  unless exempted by the CEO, complete an approved course of study or instruction; and 
(2)  have sufficient suitable experience to be a customs broker. 

Current Approved Course 

For the purposes of section 183CC of the Act, certain specified units of a Certificate IV course 
titled ‘Australian and International Trade Facilitation’ provided by Technical and Further 
Education (TAFE) institutions have formed the approved course of study for a broker’s licence 
for many years.  Completion of these units is recognised as completion of the ‘approved course 
of study’.  The specified units, referred to as the existing course, are:

CEO Determination No. 2  2006 
Customs Act (Strength of Alcoholic Beverages) Determination 

Section 153AB of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) requires customs duty to be paid on an 
alcoholic beverage according to the labelled alcoholic strength of prescribed alcoholic 
beverages, even when the actual strength is less than the labelled strength.  Section 153AC 
of the Act provides that the CEO may, in writing, determine rules for working out the 
strength of prescribed alcoholic beverages including the methods of testing, sampling and 
analysis.  

CEO Determination No. 2 of 2006 (Customs Act (Strength of Alcoholic Beverages) 
Determination) establishes rules to govern the measurement of the strength of an imported 
alcoholic beverage and provides for permitted variations in labelled strength from the actual 
strength for determining the customs duty payable.  It further sets out the permissible 
methods of testing, sampling and analysis. 

CEO Determination No. 2 of 2006 (Customs Act (Strength of Alcoholic Beverages) 
Determination) came into effect for all alcoholic beverages entered or delivered into home 
consumption from the 11th July 2006. 

Operators of warehouses licensed under section 79 of the Act are reminded that if they 
choose to change the equipment they use to measure alcoholic strength to use those 
methods now permitted in this Determination, then they need to advise the CEO of Customs 
within 30 days (see section 82(1)(e) of the Act).

Indexation of certain excise and Customs tariff duty rates - August 
2006 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June Quarter 2006 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 26 July 2006.  In accordance with the indexation provisions of the Excise 
Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties on 
spirits, beer (except “home brew”) and tobacco increased on 1 August 2006.  The new rates 
are set out in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Attachment to this Notice.   

The new rates of excise and customs duty listed in the Attachment are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, i.e. the June Quarter 2006 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
June 2006 index number (154.3) has been divided by the December 2005 index number 
(150.6) to establish an indexation factor of 1.025.  As this factor is more than one, rates of 
excise and customs duty have been increased by the application of this factor.

Customs’ Approach to Managing Cargo Reporting Compliance 

Customs relies upon members of the international trading industry to provide accurate 
and timely information to assist in the risk assessment and clearance of cargo.  On 
time cargo reports are particularly important as the first step in our risk assessment 
process.  Customs and industry have been working together in recent years to achieve 
improved cargo reporting compliance.  

In most cases we encourage and support voluntary compliance through means such as 
education, examination and feedback to our clients.  These always have been and 
always will be the primary means we use to achieve compliance with Customs-related 
laws.   

However our experience also shows that a penalty regime is an important element in 
ensuring compliance when other efforts have not achieved compliant behaviour.   Part 
of this regime is the Infringement Notice Scheme (INS) that was introduced on 1 July 
2002.   

The purpose of this notice is to inform you about how we administer the INS and to 
address concerns regarding certain situations in which non-compliant behaviour may 
have arisen as a result of circumstances beyond a cargo reporter’s control.  This 
guidance is particularly relevant as a number of new import related offence provisions 
are due to soon come into operation.   

Customs Regulatory Philosophy 

The INS applies to a range of ‘strict liability’ offences for breaches of statutory 
obligations where it is considered there is significant risk to the community and 
revenue.  Our intention is to minimise these risks through education and client 
feedback in the first instance.   

It is important that, as a first step, reporters are aware of the new reporting 
requirements and, hence, the offences that may arise. Therefore we have focused on 
working with industry over the last few years to raise awareness of the new reporting 
requirements and the offences that may arise. A list of the new import related offences 
is contained in Attachment A. Further explanation of each of these and other offences 
covered by the scheme is provided in the Infringement Notice Guidelines that can be 
found on our internet site at www.customs.gov.au.   

Operation of the Moratorium 

An administrative moratorium applies to all of these offences, except for the section 
64AB offence relating to electronic cargo reporting, until 12 April 2006.  This means 
that we will not take penalty action for an offence that occurs before 13 April 2006.

Amendment Regulations 2006 (No.1)).  This action was foreshadowed in the Explanatory 
Memorandum to the Bill for the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International 
Trade Modernisation) Act 2001 (the ITM Act).  

This now means that the period for refund applications aligns with the time limit for Customs to 
collect short levied duty under section 165 of the Customs Act 1901 and the time limits for the 
refund and recovery of the Goods and Services Tax under legislation administered by the 
Australian Taxation Office.   

The four year refund application period applies to any eligible transaction processed under the 
import related aspects of the ITM Act.  This means that the extended refund application period 
will apply to: 
•  entries processed in the Integrated Cargo System; 
•  entries processed in COMPILE after the import cut-over date of 12 October 2005 (as part of 

• 

the contingency arrangements in place until 3 February 2006); and 
information provided to Customs under new sections 71AAAB (which relates to personal or 
household effects of a passenger of a ship or aircraft) and 71AAAF (which relates to certain 
low value goods) of the Customs Act. 

Where refund applications previously had to be made within twelve months of a specified event 
(such as a decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the making of a Tariff Concession 
Order), the new arrangements allow for an extended period.  This means that where the 
relevant event occurs more than three years after the duty was paid, the owner of the goods will 
still have twelve months from the date of the event to apply for a refund.  This ensures that an 
owner of goods covered by these circumstances is not disadvantaged by the changes. 

The change does not alter the 14 day period applicable to refund claims relating to the 
deterioration, damage, loss or destruction of goods. 

Customs fact sheet ""Refund applications and post warrant amendments made in the Compile 
system"" (issued in November 2005) provided guidance on the documentary process for refund 
applications relating to COMPILE entries.  Customs is currently reviewing those guidelines to 
determine whether any alteration will be required following the complete turn-off of legacy 
systems in February 2007.

Fuel tax reform and excise/duty rate changes 

The purpose of this ACN is to provide interested parties with information regarding legislation 
currently before the Parliament related to the Government’s proposed fuel reforms and the 
interrelated Treasury Review of Excise.  

Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and Customs Tariff 
Amendment (Fuel Tax and Other Measures) Bill 2006 were introduced into the Parliament on  
11 May 2006. These Bills are complementary to Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and 
Other Measures) Bill 2006 and Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) 
Bill 2006.  Details of the four Bills and their Explanatory Memorandums are available on the 
Parliament of Australia website via the following link: http://www.aph.gov.au/bills/index.htm#billsnet
Subject to passage of the Bills, changes would come into force from 1 July 2006.  

The key Customs Act measures would relate to: 

(cid:131)  manufacture using excise equivalent goods to occur at a place licensed under both 

(cid:131) 

customs and excise legislation; 
continuation of Customs control of excise-equivalent goods until an excisable liability has 
been created under the Excise Act 1901 (Excise Act), or the goods are entered into home 
consumption and relevant duties paid, or the goods are exported. 

The main Customs Tariff Act proposed changes would relate to:  

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

the rate of duty applicable to burner fuel.  The Fuel Tax Bill 2006, which was introduced 
into the House of Representatives on 29 March 2006, proposed to implement a Fuel Tax 
Credit Scheme.  Eligible businesses may have an entitlement to fuel tax credits in respect 
of the use, packaging and sale of burner fuels.  This scheme would be administered by the 
Australian Taxation Office (ATO) 
the repeal of items 44 and 67 of Schedule 4 to the Tariff Act.  Importers of excise 
equivalent goods may then enter the goods for home consumption (duty paid), or 
warehouse their goods. When the goods are used in excise manufacture the liability for 
customs duties is extinguished, except for ad valorem duty that is payable on certain 
spirits and petroleum products. 
the removal of a number of redundant provisions from the Tariff Act, including the duty 
differentials for petroleum products based on container size, sulphur content, and whether 
a petroleum product contains a fuel marker.   

More information will be provided to industry when the legislation process has progressed. 

Further information on these proposed amendments, including a concordance of the tariff items 
to  be  affected,  is  available  on  request  from  A/g  Director  Excise  and  Tax  Liaison  on  telephone 
number (02) 6275 6511 or fax number (02) 6275 6471. For inquiries concerning warehouse and 
licensing  issues  please  contact  the  Director,  Cargo  Controls  on  (02)  6275  6564.  For  more

Notices of Objection to Importation  
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of a 
trademark to object to the importation of goods which infringe their trademark.  The registered owner, or authorised 
user does this by lodging a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a 
Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two years from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of Objection 
under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since March 2006 (ACN 2006/07).  The Notices notify the objections of these 
registered owners and authorised users to the importation of goods, which infringe their trade mark or trade marks.  
Descriptions of the relevant trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=493 

For each particular trademark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  This 
refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a 
description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  
Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of 
Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject to the 
control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs if: 

− 

− 

they  have  applied  to  them,  or  in  relation  to  them,  a  sign  that  is  substantially  identical  with,  or  deceptively 
similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  

are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

unless it can be established that: 

− 

− 

the goods are being imported other than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, 
amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been 
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the 
trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark and the goods are imported 
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the Trade 
Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to the 
implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", 
""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.

Notices of Objection to Importation 
Copyright Act 1968 

The Copyright Act 1968 allows the owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, to object to the 
importation of goods that infringe copyright.  The owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, does this 
by lodging a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice 
of Objection remains in force for a period of two years from the date of commencement.    

The attached Schedule sets out the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, who have lodged a Notice of 
Objection under the Copyright Act 1968 since March 2006 (ACN 2006/08).  The Notices notify the objections 
of the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, to the importation of goods that infringe their copyright. A 
description of where copyright is claimed is also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Copyright Notices of Objection is available at 
www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=4497. 

Goods identified by Customs at the border as potentially infringing copyright are liable to be seized by 
Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 
- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc); or 
the goods do not infringe the copyright. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Copyright Act 1968 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, 
as to the implications of the copyright legislation. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of 
each State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices 
of Objection, or Customs’ role in respect of those Notices, should contact the Customs Information and 
Support Centre on 1300 363 263 or the Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6275 6577.

DEFINITION OF ""CONSIGNMENT"" FOR THE PURPOSES OF 
SECTION 68 OF THE CUSTOMS ACT 1901 

This advice supersedes ACN 93/84. 

Section 68 of the Customs Act 1901 requires the entry of imported goods into home consumption 
or warehousing.  For such goods, Section 68(1)(f) provides that Section 68 does not apply to 

goods, other than prescribed goods: 
(i) 

that are included in a consignment consigned otherwise than by post by one 
person to another; and 
that are all transported to Australia in the same ship or aircraft; and 
that have a value not exceeding $1,000  (Customs Regulation 31AC refers). 

(ii) 
(iii) 

Some importers and brokers are using Self Assessed Clearance declarations to separately enter 
multiple packages (each covered by separate air waybills or ocean bills of lading) consigned from 
one consignor to one consignee on the one ship or aircraft.   

Where goods are shipped from one consignor to one consignee and the goods are sent on the one 
ship or aircraft, irrespective of the number of packages in which the goods are sent or the number 
of related air waybills or ocean bills, all packages should for the purposes of Section 68 be taken to 
be one consignment.  It follows that, if the total value of all the packages sent from a single 
consignor to a single consignee on one ship or aircraft exceeds $1,000, the goods must be formally 
entered in accordance with the provisions of Section 68.   

While a Self Assessed Clearance declaration of goods imported by post is not required for a 
consignment with a value not exceeding $1,000 (Regulation 41B (d) refers), the same principle 
determining the composition of a consignment applies equally to postal goods.

Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2006 - Alterations to Items 31 
and 71 of Schedule 4 

Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2006 was tabled in Parliament on 15 June 2006.  The Proposal 
contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff), with effect from 
1 July 2006, to: 

•  expand the terms of item 31 in Part II of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff; and 

•  expand the Enhanced Project By-law Scheme (item 71 in Part III of Schedule 4 to the 

Customs Tariff) to include the duty free entry of qualifying goods for the power supply and 
water supply industries. 

Currently, item 31 allows for the duty free entry of aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for 
use in the manufacture, repair or maintenance of aircraft, other than textiles and goods made 
from textiles; and goods for use in the servicing of aircraft.  The Proposal alters the item by 
omitting the words “repair or maintenance” and replacing them with “repair, maintenance or 
modification”.  The effect of this alteration will be to allow certain goods for use in the 
modification of aircraft to be entered under item 31 at a rate of customs duty of Free. 

Item 71 underpins the Enhanced Project By-law Scheme offering tariff concessions to major 
projects in the mining, resource processing, agriculture, food processing, food packaging, 
manufacturing and gas supply industries, for imported capital equipment that is not able to be 
sourced in Australia. 

The Proposal expands item 71 to include capital equipment that is not able to be sourced in 
Australia for the power supply and water supply industries. 

The following Customs Tariff reprint pages to reflect the above changes will be available in the 
week commencing 26 June 2006: Schedule 4/15 (R.9) and Schedule 4/35 (R.4).

Customs Tariff Amendments Resulting from the Government’s 
Fuel Tax Reform and Review of Excise  

This notice updates some of the information contained in ACN No 2006/22 of 18 May 2006. 
The Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Act 2006 – No. 77 of 
2006 – received the Royal Assent on 26 June 2006. That Act amends the Customs Tariff Act 
1995 (the Customs Tariff), with effect from 1 July 2006, to implement changes that are 
complementary to amendments contained in the Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and 
Other Measures) Act 2006 – No 76 of 2006.   

These measures are designed to strengthen Customs control over certain goods that are used 
in the manufacture of excisable goods. This will ensure that imported excise equivalent goods 
(certain alcohol, tobacco and petroleum products) are subject to customs duty at the same rate 
as the excise duty imposed under the Excise Tariff Act 1921 for the same products when they 
are manufactured or produced in Australia.   

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Act 2006 amends the 
Customs Tariff by: 

(cid:131) 

incorporating in the Customs Tariff, alterations contained in Customs Tariff Proposal 
(No. 5) 2005, which reduced customs duty rates for avgas and aviation kerosene to 
$0.02854 per litre, effective from 1 November 2005;  

(cid:131)  amending Schedules 3, 5 and 6 of the Customs Tariff to align customs duties with 

amended excise classifications and rates of duty;   

(cid:131) 

changing the definition of mead to conform with the definition in the 
 A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999;  

(cid:131)  aligning the snuff tobacco rate with the ordinary tobacco rate of $290.74/kg;  

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

changing the tobacco (not stemmed or stripped) rate from Free to $290.74/kg. This rate 
will be subject to indexation. This provision is designed to protect the revenue should 
any imported leaf be unaccounted for before excise manufacture;  

repealing items 44 and 67 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff, that currently allow 
concessional importation, for excise equivalent goods that are for use in the 
manufacture of excisable goods; and 

(cid:131) 

reclassifying biodiesel from Chapter 15 to Chapter 38 of the Customs Tariff. 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Act 2006 also 
implements minor consequential amendments to the Customs Tariff including: 

(cid:131)

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2006-33.pdf,Legal changes and new administrative arrangements for excise manufacturers that use imported excise equivalent goods from 1 July 2006,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2006/33 

Legal changes and new administrative arrangements for excise 
manufacturers that use imported excise equivalent goods from 
1 July 2006 

The purpose of this ACN is to provide to excise manufacturers who use imported excise 
equivalent goods further details of new administrative arrangements that will come into effect 
from 1 July 2006. These changes are the result of Government fuel tax reform and reform of 
other excise arrangements. 

Customs duty is imposed on certain goods (including alcohol, tobacco and petroleum products) 
imported into Australia.  If these goods were produced or manufactured in Australia they would 
be liable for excise duty.  Customs therefore imposes an equivalent rate of duty on the imported 
(or excise equivalent) goods to ensure consistency in treatment for both imported and domestic 
goods in the Australian market. 

In June 2004, the Treasurer announced proposed reforms that were designed to provide excise 
and customs duty relief for a wide range of businesses and households.  The main feature of 
the proposed reforms was the removal of the effective excise and customs duty from burner 
fuels and the replacement of refunds and remissions with the fuel tax credit system.  At that 
time, it was also decided to conduct a review of the arrangements that apply to all excisable 
products (the Review), being alcohol (other than wine), petroleum products and tobacco and 
tobacco products.  The Review was also extended to cover the imported excise equivalent 
goods, which are governed by the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) and the Customs Tariff Act 
1995 (Tariff Act). 

The Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Act 2006 and the Customs 
Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Act 2006 received Royal Assent on 
27 June 2006 – Nos 76 and 77 of 2006 respectively.  These Acts are complementary to the 
Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Act 2006 and the Excise 
Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Act 2006.  These changes come into 
force on 1 July 2006. 

The key legal and administrative changes are:  

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

to allow the manufacture of excisable goods to occur in a customs warehouse; 

to create a requirement that manufacture using excise equivalent goods is to occur at a 
place licensed under both customs and excise legislation; 

to continue customs control of excise-equivalent goods until an excisable liability has 
been created under the Excise Act 1901, or the goods are entered into home 
consumption and relevant duties paid, or the goods are exported; 

to create a requirement that excise manufacturers who use imported excise equivalent 
goods will acquit their Customs duty liabilities via a modified weekly import declaration 
(ex-warehouse (Nature 30) form) quoting treatment code 444.  Tariff rate Number 044 
must also be quoted on ‘Customs Excise Return’.  For goods imported after 
1 July 2006, treatment code 444 will only be available for use on Customs weekly 
‘Excise Returns’.  The item 44 treatment code 444 may continue to be used, as 
previously, for refund purposes, for goods imported prior to 1 July 2006.  ‘Customs

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
Regulation 4C – Importation of in-situ chrysotile asbestos 

The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (PI Regulations) have been amended to 
control the importation of all goods containing chrysotile asbestos in accordance with 
recommendations made by the Workplace Relations Ministers’ Council in August 2005.  The 
common term for goods that incorporate chrysotile asbestos is ‘in-situ chrysotile goods’. 

Import and export restrictions on asbestos came into effect in December 2003.  These 
restrictions did not specifically cover goods that incorporated chrysotile asbestos.  These PI 
Regulation amendments now include chrysotile asbestos, as per the Ministers’ Council 
recommendations. 

The amendments repeal Part 1 of Schedule 3B and subregulation 4C(4) of the Principle 
Regulations so that all goods containing chrysotile asbestos are now subject to import control.  
Minor administrative amendments have also been made to subregulations 4(C)(3), 4(C)(5) (a) 
and Schedule 3B, Part 2 to remove redundant headings and references.  

The amendments took effect from 15 July 2006.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 
Export of Human Embryos 

The following amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (the Prohibited 
Exports Regulations) was registered on 27 July 2006, and takes effect from 28 July 2006. 

Regulation 7 of the Prohibited Exports Regulations prohibits the export of human embryos 
without the permission of the Minister for Justice and Customs. That regulation was due to 
cease at the end of 31 July 2006.   

The amendment to regulation 7 extends the export control until 31 July 2007.  This will allow the 
Australian Government further time to consider the recommendations arising from the 
Legislation Review of Australia’s Prohibition of Human Cloning Act 2002 and the Research 
Involving Human Embryos Act 2002.  

The amendments do not alter any other part of the regulation.  Anyone wishing to export a 
human embryo will need to apply for permission from the Minister for Justice and Customs 
through the Attorney-General’s Department (ACN 2003/24 refers).

Commerce Markings on Imported Goods 

General 
Customs administers the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 (the Act) and the subordinate 
Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940 (the Regulations) that set out labelling requirements for certain 
goods imported into Australia.  

Goods imported contrary to the legislation may be forfeited to the Crown. 

This Notice is intended as a guide to the legislation but is not intended to substitute for that legislation.  
Importers should refer to the legislation in order to determine whether their imported goods will comply with 
the legislation. 

Goods bearing a false trade description may not be imported or 
exported 
The Act prohibits the import or export of any goods bearing a false trade description, or not bearing a 
prescribed trade description. There are currently no prescribed trade descriptions for goods exported from 
Australia. 

A false trade description means a trade description applied to goods which is false or likely to mislead in a 
material respect, whether because of what it says, or what it does not say. The definition of a false trade 
description includes one that has been altered in a way that makes the description false or likely to mislead 
in a material respect. 

Goods which are required to have a prescribed trade description 
The Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940 prescribe both the imported goods to which trade descriptions 
must be applied and the required trade description for such goods.  Importation of goods not marked in 
accordance with the regulations is prohibited.  

Goods required to be marked with the name of the country in which they were made or produced are listed 
in the Regulations (7(1)(a) to (s)), and in the table below.  They include goods imported in the packages in 
which they are customarily offered for sale (Regulation 7(1)(s)). 

Some of these goods (see Regulation 8c(ii)) are also required to be marked with a true description of the 
goods.  A factual description that will help inform purchasers about the nature of the goods, for example, a 
description such as 'Genuine Cowhide' on a leather wallet or '100 % cotton' on a shirt, would be 
acceptable, provided that description is correct.  

Marking requirements for goods listed in Regulation 7(1)(a) to (s) are listed in greater detail in the section 
headed ""Goods requiring labelling"" below. 

Where required the trade description must be: 

• 

• 

• 

in the English language, 

in prominent and legible characters, and 

on a principal label or brand affixed in a prominent position and in as permanent a manner as 
practicable to the goods, or if marking of the goods themselves is impracticable, to the coverings 
containing the goods. 

Any matter included on the label, brand or package that is in addition to the required trade description 
must not tend to contradict or obscure the trade description.

Special Safeguards on Canned Pineapple from Thailand 

By Notice published in the Commonwealth Gazette on 31/08/2006, the Minister for 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has imposed special safeguards on imports of 
canned pineapple from Thailand. The provisions relate to canned pineapple classified 
under Tariff Heading 2008.20.00 (Statistical codes 26 and 27).   

The effect of the provisions is that instead of being free of duty, all canned pineapple 
imported from Thailand will attract the general rate of duty of 5% from 01/09/2006 
until 31 December 2006 (Preference Scheme “GEN” in ICS), unless “in-transit” 
provisions apply (Preference Scheme “THSS” in ICS).  Please also refer to ACN 
2005/27 for more information on claiming preferential rates of duty in the ICS. 

Importation occurs upon ""the bringing of goods into a port with an intention to land 
them at that port, or an action which actually results in the goods being landed”. 

To qualify for “in-transit” provisions, the goods must meet the requirements of being 
Thai originating, have a valid Thai Certificate of Origin at time of importation, and be 
exported from Thailand on or before 31/08/2006, under a contract entered into on or 
before 31/08/2006. 

The safeguards will cease to apply to goods imported on or after 1 January 2007, but 
may be re-imposed if the limit of 6,706,725 litres is reached in 2007.  Customs will 
provide further advice to importers if that occurs.

for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has imposed special safeguards on imports of 
tuna from Thailand. The provisions relate to prepared or preserved tuna classified 
under Tariff Heading 1604.14.00.   

The effect of the provisions is that instead of being subject to 2.5% duty, prepared or

Scheme “THSS” in ICS).  Please also refer to ACN 2005/27 for more information on

Customs Tariff Amendment  
(2007 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2006 

The World Customs Organization sponsors the International Convention on the Harmonized 
Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly referred to as the Harmonized System 
(HS).  The HS obliges signatory parties, including Australia, to implement approximately 600 
amendments to HS classifications, from 1 January 2007.  The HS forms the basis of the 
Australian Customs Tariff (the Customs Tariff) and the Australian Harmonized Export 
Commodity Classification (AHECC).   

The HS is reviewed approximately every five years.  The aims of the current review (the third) 
are to amend the HS to delete those headings and subheadings where there are low levels of 
international trade; amend the system to reflect changes in industry practices and technological 
developments; and provide new subheadings to allow signatory parties to separately identify 
new products for community protection reasons.  Many amendments are also designed to 
clarify the existing descriptions and terminology. 

The present review requires approximately 1,200 changes to the Customs Tariff, affecting 20% 
of commodity classifications.  These changes are spread throughout the Customs Tariff and will 
have at least some impact on most industry sectors. 

The necessary legislation to amend the Customs Tariff has now been prepared and was 
introduced in the House of Representatives on 7 September 2006 as the Customs Tariff 
Amendment (2007 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2006.  As occurred with previous reviews 
of the HS, in 1996 and 2002, and in accordance with Government policy, the legislation has 
been designed to preserve, to the greatest extent possible, existing duty rates for imports into 
Australia, and margins of tariff preference accorded to Australia’s trading partners.   

Concordance and Explanatory Memorandum 

A concordance of tariff items affected by the proposed changes to the Customs Tariff is 
available with this ACN from the special HS 2007 page on the Customs website at 
http://www.customs.gov.au, then select Import/Export and Customs Tariff.  This concordance 
should be read in conjunction with the Explanatory Memorandum that was tabled in the 
Parliament with the legislation.  This document is also available on the Customs website. 

Statistical Codes 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has begun the process of drafting new statistical 
codes for the proposed changes. 

The proposed changes will be progressively made available on the ABS website.  This may be 
accessed on the internet at www.abs.gov.au, then select Themes, Foreign Trade, Noticeboard.  
The ABS welcomes comments made, before 6 October 2006, on errors in the proposed 
statistical codes for the new revised tariff and AHECC headings and subheadings. 

Other Matters 

When the Bill is passed by the Parliament revised Customs Tariff working pages incorporating

HS 2007 proposed tariff changes – implications for Tariff 
Concession Orders and tariff/origin advices and precedents 

Australian Customs Notice No. 2006/44 provides advice on the amendments to the 
Customs Tariff Act 1995 contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment (2007 Harmonized 
System Changes) Bill 2006, which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 
7 September 2006.  Those amendments reflect the changes arising out of the third review of the 
World Customs Organization (WCO) International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity 
Description and Coding System, to enter into force on 1 January 2007 (the HS 2007 changes). 

Subject to parliamentary passage of the Bill, the HS 2007 changes will impact on a number of 
Customs’ instruments and decisions, including Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs), Tariff 
Precedents, Tariff Advices (TAs) and Origin Advice Rulings. 

Tariff Concession Orders 

Customs has commenced a review of TCOs potentially affected by the HS 2007 changes.  
Many TCOs will need to be revoked on 31 December 2006 and replaced with one or more new 
TCOs under the appropriate HS 2007 tariff classifications, with effect from 1 January 2007. 

TCOs intended to be revoked will be valid until 31 December 2006.  However, once 
preparations for the revocation of a TCO have commenced, that TCO will no longer appear in 
the general TCO lists found on the Customs website Import/Export Customs Tariff page 
(http://www.customs.gov.au).  The Customs website does not list TCOs that are in the process 
of revocation. 

Customs will provide further information on TCOs affected by the proposed HS 2007 changes 
before 1 January 2007.  That information will be posted on a special HS 2007 page on the 
Customs internet website (see Enquiries below), and will include: 

•  a list of all TCOs to be revoked, including their descriptions (until 31 December 2006, 
those relying on the internet to identify TCOs that may apply to their imports should 
refer to this new list, as well as to the general TCO lists); and  

•  a concordance showing the current and proposed TCO reference numbers and their 

relevant tariff classifications. 

Tariff Precedents 

Customs will shortly commence a review of Tariff Precedents potentially affected by the 
HS 2007 changes.  Many Tariff Precedents will need to be voided.  Where possible, voided 
Tariff Precedents will be replaced after 1 January 2007.  There will be circumstances, however, 
where this will not be possible.  

Customs will provide further information on Tariff Precedents affected by the HS 2007 changes.  
That information will also be posted on the special HS 2007 page on the Customs website (see 
Enquiries below), and will include: 

•  a list of all Tariff Precedents to be voided; and 

•  a concordance showing the old and the new Tariff Precedent reference numbers and 

their relevant tariff classifications (to be provided after 1 January 2007).

Notices of Objection to Importation  
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of a trade 
mark to object to the importation of goods which infringe their trade mark.  The registered owner, or authorised user 
does this by lodging a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a 
Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two years from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of Objection 
under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since June 2006 (ACN 2006/25).  The Notices notify the objections of these 
registered owners and authorised users to the importation of goods, which infringe their trade mark or trade marks.  
Descriptions of the relevant trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=493

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  This 
refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a 
description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  
Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of 
Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject to the 
control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs if: 

− 

− 

They  have  applied  to  them,  or  in  relation  to  them, a  sign  that  is  substantially  identical with,  or  deceptively 
similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  

are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

unless it can be established that: 

− 

− 

the goods are being imported other than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc); or 

the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, 
amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been 
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the 
trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark and the goods are imported 
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to 
the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", 
""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
– Importation of firearms and related goods 

Regulation 4F and Schedule 6 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the 
Regulations) have been amended in order to clarify the import controls on firearms, ammunition, 
parts, accessories, magazines and replicas and make the Regulations more user-friendly.  
These amendments commenced on 22 September 2006. 

The changes include: 

• 

Inserting a definition of deactivated firearms and allowing these firearms to be exempt 
from safety testing requirements; 

•  Streamlining the procedure for reimporting firearms that were temporarily exported and 

are being re-imported into Australia without modification; 

•  Allowing the importation of articles to be destroyed or wholly consumed in testing when 
imported for the purposes of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory government; 
Inclusion of a new branch of the specified purposes test to broaden the circumstances 
in which firearms can be imported for research and development purposes; 

• 

•  Changing the firearms safety test to allow for new firearms technologies to be tested, 
and allow certain consignments to be passed or failed on the basis of a sample from 
that consignment; 
Inclusion of provisions that allow firearm dealers to on-sell Category C firearms 
imported for demonstration or testing purposes; 

• 

•  Clarification of the definition of firearms accessory to make it explicit that it includes 

collapsible and telescopic firearms stocks; 
•  Clarification of the definition of a firearm replica; 
•  Provisions clarifying restrictions on the importation of high capacity detachable 

magazines for pump-action and lever-action centre fire rifles; 

•  Clarification of the controls on magazines for fully automatic firearms; 
•  Clarification of the requirements that apply to the importation of interchangeable 

firearms parts.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 – 
Rough Diamonds from Sierra Leone and Côte d’Ivoire. 

Regulations amending the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the PI 
Regulations) were signed by the Governor-General on 19 October 2006, and take 
effect from 21 October 2006. 

The previous ban on the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone has been 
removed, whilst a new, absolute prohibition has been imposed upon the importation 
of rough diamonds from Côte d’Ivoire. 

Sierra Leone 

Regulation 4N of the PI Regulations prohibited the importation of rough diamonds 
from Sierra Leone unless the permission of the Foreign Minister or an authorised 
person had been granted.  Regulation 4N was introduced to implement the ban upon 
the importation of such diamonds pursuant to United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 1306 (2000), and renewed by subsequent Security Council Resolutions.   

On 5 June 2003 the President of the Security Council announced that this import ban 
would not be renewed.  Australia however maintained the control due to the proximity 
of Liberia and other countries involved in diamond smuggling.  The ban is no longer 
considered necessary by Australia. 

Whilst this prohibition has been removed, the importation of rough diamonds from 
Sierra Leone is still subject to the requirement that the relevant Kimberley Process 
Certificate is provided under regulation 4MA of the PI Regulations. 

Côte d’Ivoire 

On 15 December 2005, the Security Council imposed a binding obligation on all 
member States, including Australia, to prohibit absolutely the importation of rough 
diamonds from Côte d’Ivoire under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1643 
(2005).  Accordingly, new regulation 4N of the PI Regulations prohibits the 
importation of rough diamonds from Côte d’Ivoire, even if the importer has a 
Kimberley Process Certificate.

Notices of Objection to Importation  
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of a trade 
mark to lodge a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs), objecting to the importation of 
goods which infringe their trade mark.  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of two 
years from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of Objection 
under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since September 2006 (ACN 2006/46).  Descriptions of the relevant trade marks 
are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=493 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  This 
refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a 
description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  
Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice of 
Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject to the 
control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs if: 

− 

− 

They  have  applied  to  them,  or  in  relation  to  them,  a  sign  that  is  substantially  identical  with,  or  deceptively 
similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  

are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

unless it can be established that: 

− 

− 

the goods are being imported other than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc); or

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, 
amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been 
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the 
trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark and the goods are imported 
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as to 
the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"",

Customs Amendment 
(2007 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2006 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (2007 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2006 and the 
Customs Amendment (2007 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2006 were passed by the 
Parliament on 19 October 2006.  It is expected that these Bills will receive the 
Royal Assent in the near future. 

As mentioned in Australian Customs Notices 2006/44 and 2006/45, which were issued in 
mid-September, the Tariff Amendment Bill contains approximately 1,200 amendments to 
the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that will implement changes resulting from the third review 
of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, by the World Customs 
Organization.  These changes will take effect from 1 January 2007. 

The Customs Amendment Bill contains amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to enable 
the CEO of Customs to revoke Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs), and make replacement 
TCOs, as a result of classification changes before those changes take effect.  As 
foreshadowed in the September ACNs, current TCOs affected by the changes will be 
revoked with effect from 1 January 2007 and replacement TCOs will take effect then. 

For further information, please refer to Australian Customs Notices No 2006/44 and 
No 2006/45 which provide links to the ‘Harmonized System 2007 information page’ on 
the Customs website at www.customs.gov.au and to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 
website at www.abs.gov.au. 

More details about the implications of the changes for TCOs, Tariff Advices, 
Tariff Precedents and Origin Advices will be made available progressively in the next few 
weeks.  Regional seminars about these issues will be offered during November 2006, with 
further assistance being made available after that time in response to client demand.  
Revised Customs Tariff working pages incorporating the HS related changes, including 
new statistical codes, are expected to be available in mid-November.

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) 

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 and the 
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 relating to the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korea, were registered on the Federal Register of 
Legislative Instruments on 2 November 2006. 

UNSC Sanctions 
UNSC Resolution 1718 obliges Member States to take steps to prevent the direct or indirect 
supply, sale or transfer of arms and related matériel, consisting of any battle tanks, armoured 
combat vehicles, large calibre artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, 
missiles or missile systems to the DPRK. 

In addition, UNSC Resolution 1718 obliges Member States to take steps to prevent the direct or 
indirect supply, sale or transfer of items, materials, equipment and goods which could contribute 
to the DPRK’s nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related or other weapons of mass destruction-
related programmes.  UNSC Resolution 1718 further obliges Member States to take steps to 
prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to the DPRK of luxury goods. 

As a result, Regulation 13CO of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 has been 
introduced with effect from 2 November 2006.  This regulation prohibits the exportation of arms 
and related matériel, goods which could contribute to the development and deployment of a 
WMD, as well as certain luxury goods to the DPRK without the written permission of the Minister 
for Foreign Affairs.  However, the exportation of goods listed in the defence and strategic goods 
list continues to be controlled under regulation 13E of the PE Regulations. 

UNSC Resolution 1718 also obliges Member States to prevent the importation from the DPRK 
of the arms and related materiel listed above (battle tanks, etc) and items, materials, equipment 
and goods which could contribute to the development and deployment of a WMD programme. 

As a result, Regulation 4Y of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 has been 
introduced with effect from 2 November 2006.  This regulation prohibits the importation from the 
DPRK of the arms and related materiel listed above (battle tanks, etc) and goods which could 
contribute to the development and deployment of a WMD, without the written permission of the 
Minister for Foreign Affairs. 

The written permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or an authorised officer of his 
Department, must be produced to Customs before such goods are cleared for exportation to or 
importation from the DPRK.

Changes to Duty Drawback Regulations 

Recent amendments were made to the Customs Regulations 1926 to provide greater 
flexibility for industry in lodging duty drawback applications and to simplify the 
drawback of customs duty on imported goods.  The amendments came into operation 
on 21 October 2006. 

In particular, the Customs Amendment Regulations 2006 (No.4): 

•  extended the duty drawback application period from 12 months to 4 years from 
the date of export.  This aligns the application period for drawback with that for 
applications for refunds of Customs duty and for the recovery of Customs duty.  
The new 4 year application period applies to goods exported on or after             
21 October 2006; 

• 

• 

• 

removed the requirement for prior notice by industry to Customs of the 
manufacture of goods for export and of the intention to claim drawback of import 
duty.  This also reflects Customs greater reliance on self assessment by industry 
backed by risk management, audit strategies and electronic systems to maintain 
revenue control;   

increased the minimum claim amount from $50 to $100.  This means that any 
single duty drawback claim must amount to at least $100.  This may cover either 
one single export transaction or a number of small value export transactions that 
add up to at least $100; 

clarified the ‘representative shipment’ method of claiming duty drawback.  This 
method allows the amount of a claim for drawback of import duty to be calculated 
by reference to representative earlier shipments of the same goods (as opposed 
to the actual shipment of the goods); and 

•  made other changes of a minor or technical nature. 

Any queries concerning this ACN may be addressed to Refund Policy on telephone

Proposed new Rules of Origin - Australia New Zealand Closer Economic 
Relations Trade Agreement (Anzcerta) 

The Customs Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Rules Of Origin) Bill 2006 was 
introduced into the House of Representatives on Wednesday 1 November 2006.  If the 
Bill is passed, related regulations are proposed to introduce new rules of origin for 
goods traded across the Tasman. 

The new rules would give effect to amendments made to ANZCERTA, following 
negotiations between the Governments of Australia and New Zealand and an 
announcement in February 2006 by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for 
Industry, Tourism and Resources. The changes are planned to come into force on 
1 January 2007, subject to successful passage of the legislation and finalisation of the 
agreement processes and related regulations. 

The Bill provides new product specific rules for determining whether goods are New 
Zealand originating goods, including the ‘change in tariff classification’ method.  This 
means that ‘substantial transformation’ of goods can be demonstrated if the 
classification changes.  The Bill also maintains the existing ‘regional value content’ 
rules of origin for a period of five years (until 31 December 2011).  Up until this time, 
goods would qualify for preferential treatment under either the new or existing rules. 

The proposed amendments will require the exporter, the principal manufacturer or a 
producer of Australian originating goods to maintain records for when a preferential 
rate of duty is being claimed.  The requirements are similar to current record retention 
obligations under the Customs Act.  A difference is that they will extend to all records 
relating to the origin of the goods for which preferential tariff treatment is claimed in 
New Zealand and may include, among other things, records associated with the 
classification, origin or value of the materials used to produce the goods. 

A copy of the Bill and related Explanatory Memorandum are on the Parliament House 
website http://www.aph.gov.au/bills/index.htm  then select ‘current bills’. 

Inquiries about this notice may be directed to origin@customs.gov.au, or to the

United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1701:  
sanctions on the export of arms and related matériel to 
Lebanon  

An amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (PE Regulations) 
implementing the arms embargo against Lebanon imposed by UNSC Resolution 1701 (2006) 
takes effect on 18 December 2006.  

UNSC Resolution 1701 obliges Member States to take steps to prevent the sale or supply of 
arms and related matériel to Lebanon unless such sale or supply is authorised by the 
Government of Lebanon or by the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon. 

New regulation 13CP of the PE Regulations gives effect to Resolution 1701.  The new 
regulation prohibits the exportation of arms and related matériel to Lebanon without the written 
permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or an authorised person.  Permission must be 
produced to Customs before goods are cleared for exportation.   

The exportation of most military goods and dual use goods from Australia is already controlled 
under regulation 13E of the PE Regulations.  The new regulation controls those goods which 
are not already covered by regulation 13E. 

All importers, exporters, customs brokers and freight forwarders must use the Country Code LB, 
when reporting to Customs the exportation of goods to Lebanon.  Errors in country codes will 
lead to delays in the clearance of cargo.  Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to the 
Manager, Counter Proliferation on telephone number (02) 6275 6189, or fax number (02) 6275 
6699.

Tariff Working Pages and Tariff Advices – HS 2007 

Tariff Working Pages 

Customs has finalised the amendments to its publication titled Combined Australian 
Customs Tariff Nomenclature and Statistical Classification (commonly referred to as the 
Tariff Working Pages) to reflect the changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to apply from 
1 January 2007.  Those changes were contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment (2007 
Harmonized System Changes) Act 2006, which received Royal Assent on 4 November 2006.  
Australian Customs Notices (ACNs) 2006/44, 45 and 51 were released in September and 
October 2006 concerning those changes. 

The Tariff Working Pages will be available on the Harmonized System 2007 information 
page on the Customs website www.customs.gov.au from 17 November 2006.  The printed 
version of the Tariff Working Pages will be despatched to subscribers in the week 
commencing 20 November 2006. 

Tariff Advices 

As advised in ACN 2006/45, Tariff Advices (TAs) potentially affected by the HS 2007 
changes would be voided in December 2006.  Further advice on those TAs has been sent to 
relevant importers and placed on the Customs website.  That advice applies only to TAs that 
would have remained valid on 1 January 2007, but for the HS 2007 changes. 

TAs are valid for five years from the date that they are finalised unless voided for other 
reasons.  Customs has identified approximately 4 000 TAs in the TA processing system 
(TAPIN) that are or will become invalid by 30 November 2006. 

In the weeks commencing 20 and 27 November 2006, Customs plans to review TAPIN 
records for TAs that are no longer valid to ensure that their status is “void”.  TAPIN records 
for TAs that become invalid during December 2006 will be adjusted in January 2007. 

Customs encourages importers to check that their TAs are less than five years old before 
quoting them on import declarations.  Customs will regularly review, and adjust where 
necessary, the status of TAs in the TAPIN database.   

Enquiries 

Enquiries should be directed to TARLEG@customs.gov.au or to the Manager Tariff 
Legislation on (02) 6275 6486 (for Tariff Working Pages) or to the Director HS 2007 
Implementation Project on (02) 6275 6551 (for TAs to be voided).

AUSTRALIA–UNITED STATES FREE TRADE AGREEMENT – 
HS2007 RULES OF ORIGIN 

On 1 January 2007 some of the classifications in the Customs Tariff Act 1995 will change 
as a result of the 2007 amendments to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding 
System (HS2007 changes).  Detailed information on the HS2007 changes is available in 
Australian Customs Notices 2006/44, 45 and 51 and 57 which are available on the Customs 
web page at http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=5663.   

These changes affect some of the Rules of Origin in the Australia-United States Free Trade 
Agreement (AUSFTA).  The Customs (Australia-US Free Trade Agreement) Regulations 
2004 (the AUSFTA Regulations) have been amended to take account of the changes*.  The 
changes have been made to ensure that the rules of origin continue to grant preferential 
status to US originating goods. 

Importers into Australia should refer to the Tariff Concordance to see if there has been a 
change in classification as a result of the HS2007 changes:   The Tariff Concordance is 
available at http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=5663. 

To assist in determining whether a particular Rule of Origin has been affected, Customs has 
produced the following documents: 

•  AUSFTA Rules of Origin Summary of HS2007 Changes*; and 
•  Amended Manual 8C – the amended Manual 8C contains the new Rules of Origin.  The 
existing Manual 8C (containing the Rules of Origin valid until 1 January 2007) will 
remain available until 1 January 2007*. 

*  These documents, along with the consolidated AUSFTA Regulations, are available on the Rules 

of Origin – Preferential Origin United States Customs web page at 
http//www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?5342. 

Exporters to the United States should be aware that the US International Trade Commission 
has issued an important note concerning its HS2007 changes, which will not be 
implemented in the US on 1 January 2007.  Further information is available at 
http://www.usitc.gov/concerning_2007_hts.asp .  For goods exported from Australia, the 
Export Declaration should be based on the HS2007 AHECC.  Further information on the 
AHECC is available on the ABS website at

2021-01-14,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2006-59.pdf,ACN 2006/59 has been superseded by 2021/01,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2006/59   

Definition of ""consignment""  for the purposes of Section 68 of the 
Customs  Act 1901   

This advice has been superseded by ACN 2021/01   

Section 68 of the Customs Act 1901 requires the entry of imported goods into home consumption 
or warehousing.  However, section 68(1)(f) provides that this section does not apply to goods 
(other than prescribed goods):   

(i) 

(ii) 
(iii) 

that are included in a consignment consigned otherwise than by post by  one 
person to another; and   
that are all transported to Australia in the same ship or aircraft; and   
that have a value  not exceeding $1,000  (Regulation 31AC Customs Regulation 
1926 refers).   

For the purposes of this definition, Customs considers that a ‘consignor’ is not a person or an entity 
that:   

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 

consolidates goods for export to Australia; or   
is a freight forwarder or other logistical services provider; or 
is a buying agent.   

To take advantage of the $1,000 revenue threshold, some importers and brokers are using  Self-
Assessed Clearance declarations to separately enter multiple packages (each covered by 
separate air waybills or ocean bills of lading) consigned from one consignor to one consignee on 
the one ship or aircraft.     

Customs considers that, for the purposes of Section 68, irrespective of the number of packages in 
which the goods are sent from one consignor to one consignee (or the number of related air 
waybills or ocean bills) on the same ship or aircraft, all such packages should be treated as one 
consignment.  It follows that, if the total value of all the packages sent from a single consignor to 
a single consignee on one ship or aircraft exceeds $1,000, the goods must be formally entered in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 68.     

While a Self-Assessed Clearance declaration of goods imported by post is not required for a 
consignment valued at $1,000 or less (Customs Regulation 41B (d) refers), the same principle for 
determining the composition of a consignment applies equally to postal goods.

Notices of Objection to Importation  
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of a trade 
mark to lodge a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs), objecting to the importation 
of goods which infringe their trade mark.  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of 
four years (effective 23 October 2006) from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of 
Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since October 2006 (ACN 2006/49).  Descriptions of the relevant trade 
marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=493 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  This 
refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a 
description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  
Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice 
of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject to the 
control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs if: 

− 

− 

they have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively 
similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  
are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

unless it can be established that the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, 
amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been 
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the 
trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark and the goods are imported 
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as 
to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", 
""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

Where a registered trade mark owner or an authorised user with a current Notice of Objection in place request 
additional trade marks to be added to their Notice, only the additional trade marks are included at the end of this 
ACN.  The inclusion of additional trade marks in the ACN is to ensure that ACN subscribers have all the 
appropriate up-to-date information. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each 
State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of 
Objection, or Customs role in respect of those Notices, should contact the Customs Information and Support 
Centre on 1300 363 263 or the Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6275 6577.

SINGAPORE - AUSTRALIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT - IMPACT OF HS 2007 

On 1 January 2007 changes to some classifications will occur as a result of amendments to the 
Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS2007 changes)1.  Consequently, 
a number of changes to Annex 2C and Annex 2D to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade 
Agreement (SAFTA) are needed.  These changes are required to ensure the ongoing 
preferential treatment of the goods specified in those annexes after implementation of 
HS 2007. 

The process of formally amending SAFTA to reflect HS 2007 is yet to be completed between 
the two countries.  The following is provided to assist importers in clearing goods during this 
interim period. 

The range of goods covered by the two annexes after 1 January 2007 will be unaffected.  
Goods presently entitled to preferential provisions of either Annex 2C or Annex 2D will 
continue to be able to claim preferential duty treatment after 1 January 2007. 

HS 2007 will affect the classification of only some goods included in the annexes.  These 
classification changes may be at heading (4-digit), subheading (6-digit) or classification 
(8-digit) level. 

The following guidance for entering goods into Australia under the provisions of Annex 2C or 
Annex 2D has been developed to assist importers. 

1.  Refer to the concordance to see if there has been a change from HS20022. 
2.  If no change in classification resulting from the HS2007 changes, the current 

classification should be used when entering the goods.  (The 2002 classification on the 
SAFTA Certificate of Origin should be identical to the 2007 classification.) 

3.  Where a tariff classification in a SAFTA Certificate of Origin changes as a result of 

the HS 2007 changes, importers must use the HS 2007 classification when entering goods. 

Enquiries in relation to SAFTA may be directed to Origin Section, Trade Branch by email

NEW RULES OF ORIGIN – AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND 
CLOSER ECONOMIC RELATIONS TRADE AGREEMENT 
(ANZCERTA) 

Australian Customs Notice 2006/54 mentioned proposed amendments introducing 
new rules of origin for goods traded under the Australia New Zealand Closer 
Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA). 

The Customs Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Rules Of Origin) Act 2006 
(ANZCERTA Act)*, which amends the Customs Act 1901 and related Acts, will 
commence on 1 January 2007. 

The ANZCERTA Act inserts new Division 1E headed New Zealand Originating 
Goods into the Customs Act 1901*.  Division 1E contains the rules for determining 
whether goods are New Zealand originating goods and therefore eligible for a 
preferential rate of customs duty under the Customs Tariff Act 1995*. 

Customs (New Zealand Rules Of Origin) Regulations 2006 (ANZCERTA 
regulations)*, made for the purposes of new Division 1E, give affect to Annex G of 
ANZCERTA.  The ANZCERTA Regulations contain the product specific rules for 
goods imported from New Zealand.  Goods will be New Zealand originating goods 
where they meet the applicable change in tariff classification and/or regional value 
content requirement, and/or any other requirement that is specified. 

The rules in the ANZCERTA Regulations are similar to those that apply under 
the Australia-United States and the Thailand-Australia free trade agreements. 

The new product specific rules of origin are intended to replace the existing factory 
cost rules, but both sets of rules will operate concurrently from 1 January 2007 until 
31 December 2011, when the existing factory cost rules will be repealed.

AUSTRALIA-UNITED STATES FREE TRADE AGREEMENT: 
PREFERENTIAL RATES OF CUSTOMS DUTY ELIGIBILITY 

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) replaces the information relating to the Australia-United 
States Free Trade Agreement (the AUSFTA) contained in ACN 2004/47 of 25 November 2004. 

The AUSFTA commenced on 1 January 2005.  It introduced preferential treatment for some 
‘US originating goods’ (ie goods within the meaning of Division 1C of Part VIII of the Customs 
Act 1901 (the Customs Act)) that were imported into Australia from the US.  The preferential 
rates of customs duty that apply to these “US originating goods” are specified in the Customs 
Tariff Act 1995. 

A recent Federal Court judgement has led to Customs’ amending its treatment in relation to the 
entry of goods for home consumption under the AUSFTA.  The Federal Court decided that: 

""Goods which are 'US originating goods' within the meaning of Division 1C of Part VIII of the 
Customs Act which were:  

• 
• 

imported into Australia prior to 1 January 2005; and 
forthwith upon importation, entered for warehousing pursuant to s.68(2)(b) of the Customs 
Act, and 

•  on or after 1 January 2005, entered for home consumption pursuant to s.99(1)(a) of 

the Customs Act 1901, attract the rate of duty applicable to 'US originating goods' under 
the Customs Tariff Act 1995 as at the date of entry for home consumption"". 

All ‘US originating goods’ entered for home consumption after 1 January 2005 will be 
considered eligible for the preferential rates of duty for such goods under the Customs Tariff.  
Goods that were imported into Australia prior to the commencement of the AUSFTA but not 
entered for home consumption until after the commencement date (ie warehoused) would 
therefore be eligible for a preferential duty rate. 

Importers who paid the general rate of duty on such goods are entitled to refunds of duty if the 
refund applications meet the requirements under the Customs Regulations 1926 (refer to r.126 – 
r.128A) including the time limit for lodgement of refund applications.  ACN 2006/20 contains 
further information regarding refunds. 

Enquiries in relation to the AUSFTA may be directed to Origin, Trade Services 
Branch by email at origin@customs.gov.au or telephone on (02) 6275 6556.  
Enquires in relation to refunds may be directed to Cargo Policy, Trade Policy and

THAILAND–AUSTRALIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT – HS2007 
CERTIFICATES OF ORIGIN 

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) replaces the information relating to the Thailand-Australia 
Free Trade Agreement (the TAFTA) contained in ACN 2004/47 of 25 November 2004.. 

On 1 January 2007 changes to some classifications will occur as a result of amendments to the 
Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS2007 changes)1.  A number of 
changes to the Rules of Origin in the TAFTA will be needed to ensure that goods whose 
classifications will change would still be eligible for the same preferential treatment. 

Although Australia and Thailand have already agreed at officials level on changes necessary to 
enable Australia to have its domestic rules consistent with the HS2007 changes, Thailand will 
continue to employ rules based on HS 2002 until further notice. 

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Customs have developed the following 
guidance for determining whether a Thai Certificate of Origin conforms with Customs’ 
requirements from 1 January 2007.  TAFTA Certificates of Origin from Thailand2 will continue to 
be issued under HS2002, however, imports into Australia from Thailand will need to be classified 
using HS2007.  All other requirements for determining whether a good qualifies for a preferential 
rate of customs duty under the TAFTA remain unchanged. 

1.  Refer to the concordance to see if there has been a change from HS20023. 
2.  If no change in classification resulting from the HS2007 changes, the current classification 
should be used when entering the goods.  (The 2002 classification on the Thai Certificate of 
Origin should be identical to the 2007 classification.) 

3.  Where a tariff classification in a Thai Certificate of Origin changes as a result of the HS 2007 

changes, importers must use the HS 2007 classification when entering goods. 

For goods exported from Australia to Thailand under the TAFTA, the Export Declaration should 
be based on the HS 2007 AHECC, while the Australian Certificate Of Origin should be based on 
the HS 2002 AHECC4 until further notice. 

Enquiries in relation to the TAFTA can be directed to Origin Section, Trade Branch by email to 
origin@customs.gov.au or telephone on (02) 6275 6556.

Customs’ Approach to Managing Cargo Reporting Compliance 

Customs relies upon members of the international trading industry to provide accurate 
and timely information to assist in the risk assessment and clearance of cargo.  On 
time cargo reports are particularly important as the first step in our risk assessment 
process.  Customs and industry have been working together in recent years to achieve 
improved cargo reporting compliance.  

In most cases we encourage and support voluntary compliance through means such as 
education, examination and feedback to our clients.  These always have been and 
always will be the primary means we use to achieve compliance with Customs-related 
laws.   

However our experience also shows that a penalty regime is an important element in 
ensuring compliance when other efforts have not achieved compliant behaviour.   Part 
of this regime is the Infringement Notice Scheme (INS) that was introduced on 1 July 
2002.   

The purpose of this notice is to inform you about how we administer the INS and to 
address concerns regarding certain situations in which non-compliant behaviour may 
have arisen as a result of circumstances beyond a cargo reporter’s control.  This 
guidance is particularly relevant as a number of new import related offence provisions 
are due to soon come into operation.   

Customs Regulatory Philosophy 

The INS applies to a range of ‘strict liability’ offences for breaches of statutory 
obligations where it is considered there is significant risk to the community and 
revenue.  Our intention is to minimise these risks through education and client 
feedback in the first instance.   

It is important that, as a first step, reporters are aware of the new reporting 
requirements and, hence, the offences that may arise. Therefore we have focused on 
working with industry over the last few years to raise awareness of the new reporting 
requirements and the offences that may arise. A list of the new import related offences 
is contained in Attachment A. Further explanation of each of these and other offences 
covered by the scheme is provided in the Infringement Notice Guidelines that can be 
found on our internet site at www.customs.gov.au.   

Operation of the Moratorium 

An administrative moratorium applies to all of these offences, except for the section 
64AB offence relating to electronic cargo reporting, until 12 April 2006.  This means 
that we will not take penalty action for an offence that occurs before 13 April 2006.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2007-01.pdf,Amendments to the Trade Marks Act 1995 and Copyright Act 1968 - Notices of Objection to Importation,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2007/01 

Amendments to the Trade Marks Act 1995 and Copyright Act 1968 - Notices of 
Objection to Importation  

Australian Customs Service (Customs) recently initiated amendments to the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Trade Marks 
Act) and the Copyright Act 1968 (Copyright Act) to ease the administrative burden upon and costs to right holders 
and make the Notice of Objection Scheme more accessible for trade mark owners and copyright holders. 

These amendments are included in the Trade Marks Amendment Act 2006 and the Copyright Amendment Act 
2006.  (Copies of these Acts are available at www.comlaw.gov.au) 

The Trade Marks Act and Copyright Act include provisions which allow the registered trade mark owner, or 
copyright holder, and in certain circumstances, the authorised/licensed user of a right, to lodge a Notice of 
Objection with Customs, objecting to the importation of goods which infringe their rights. Although there is no fee for 
lodging these Notices, the administrative burden and costs to the objector of preparing the Notices can be 
significant, particular where a large number of rights are notified. To assist in reducing the administrative burden 
and costs to the objector, particularly when renewing the Notices, the term of a Notice of Objection has been 
increased from two years to four years in both Acts.  The requirement for a security to be paid at the time of filing a 
Notice which may have discouraged right holders from lodging Notices, has also been replaced with provisions 
allowing right holders to lodge a written undertaking.  In the undertaking the right holder will agree to repay any 
expenses incurred by the Commonwealth as a result of a seizure. 

Amendments to the Trade Marks Act: 

•  Subsections 132(4) and 132(5) have been amended so that Notices of Objection remain in force for four 

years. 

•  Subsection 133(3) will be repealed and replaced with new provisions whereby a written undertaking to 

repay an expense may be provided to the Customs CEO, instead of a cash or documentary security. 
•  New subsection 133(3A) will allow the Customs CEO to require a security in cases where the objector has 
previously defaulted on an undertaking to repay expenses, or where the CEO otherwise considers it 
reasonable in all the circumstances. 

•  New section 141A sets out what actions will be available to the Customs CEO if there is a failure by an 

Objector to comply with an undertaking, or where the security provided does not cover the 
Commonwealth’s expenses. 
Amendments to the Copyright Act: 

•  Subsection 135(5) has been amended so that notices of objection remain in force for four years. 
•  Section 135AA will be repealed and replaced with new provisions whereby a written undertaking to repay 

expenses is provided to the Customs CEO, instead of a cash or documentary security. 

•  New subsection 135AA(2) will allow the Customs CEO to require a security in cases where the objector 
has previously defaulted on an undertaking to repay expenses, or where the CEO otherwise considers it 
reasonable in all the circumstances. 

•  New section 135AJ sets out what actions are available to the Customs CEO if there is a failure by an 

Objector to comply with an undertaking, or where the security provided does not cover the 
Commonwealth’s expenses. 

Commencement: 
Amendments to the Copyright Act commenced on 01 January 2007. Amendments to the term of notices under the 
Trade Marks Act commenced on 23 October 2006 and the provisions relating to written undertakings for Trade 
Mark Notices will commence no later than 23 April 2007.  

Right holders, or their advisers, who require further information regarding these changes to the Notice of Objection 
Scheme should contact the Customs Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6275 6577.

United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1718:  
Sanctions on the export of luxury goods to the  
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) 

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 and the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 relating to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea 
(DPRK), also known as North Korea, came into effect on 3 November 2006 and were advised in 
Australian Customs Notice 2006/52. 

UNSC Sanctions 
UNSC Resolution 1718 obliges Member States to take steps to prevent the direct or indirect 
supply, sale or transfer to the DPRK of, amongst other things, certain luxury goods. 

Regulation 13CO of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 was introduced with 
effect from 3 November 2006.  This regulation prohibits the exportation of goods included on the 
luxury goods list to the DPRK unless the written permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or 
an authorised officer of his Department is produced to Customs at or before the exportation of 
such goods.  The “luxury goods list” is defined in Regulation 13CO as the luxury goods list (if 
any) determined by the Foreign Minister under the Charter of the United Nations (Sanctions – 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations 2006, as in force from time to time. 

Regulation 19 of the Charter of the United Nations (Sanctions – Democratic People’s Republic 
of Korea) Regulations 2006 provides the Foreign Minister may, by legislative instrument, 
determine a list of goods (the luxury goods list) that are to be treated as luxury goods for the 
purposes of these Regulations. 

This luxury goods list was made by the Foreign Minister on 7 December 2006 and registered on 
21 December 2006 (FRLI Number F2006L05741 refers).  The list includes a range of alcoholic 
beverages, tobacco, foodstuffs, vehicles, jewellery, precious metals and stones, and electronic 
consumer goods.  The full list came into effect on 22 December 2006 and is produced overleaf. 

The written permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or an authorised officer of his 
Department, must be produced to Customs before such goods are cleared for exportation to the 
DPRK.  The exportation of any of the listed luxury goods without this written permission being 
so produced constitutes an offence under the Customs Act 1901, the penalties for which may 
be a penalty not exceeding three times the value of the goods or a penalty not exceeding 
$110,000, whichever is the greater. 

All importers, exporters, customs brokers and freight forwarders are reminded to use the 
Country Code KP, when reporting to Customs the exportation or importation of goods to or from 
the DPRK.  Exportations and importations to or from the Republic of Korea (ROK), also known 
as South Korea, must use the Country Code KR.  Errors in country codes will lead to delays in 
the clearance of cargo, especially where the country of destination KP (North Korea) is used.  
Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to the Manager, Counter Proliferation on 
telephone number (02) 6275 6189, or fax number (02) 6275 6699.

Notices of Objection to Importation - Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of a trade 
mark to lodge a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs), objecting to the importation 
of goods which infringe their trade mark.  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of 
four years (effective 23 October 2006) from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of 
Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since December 2006 (ACN 2006/61).  Descriptions of the relevant 
trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=493 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  This 
refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a 
description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  
Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice 
of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject to the 
control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs if: 

− 

− 

they have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively 
similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  
are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

unless it can be established that the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, 
amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been 
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the 
trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark and the goods are imported 
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as 
to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", 
""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

Where a registered trade mark owner or an authorised user with a current Notice of Objection in place request 
additional trade marks to be added to their Notice, only the additional trade marks are included at the end of this 
ACN.  The inclusion of additional trade marks in the ACN is to ensure that ACN subscribers have all the 
appropriate up-to-date information. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each 
State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of 
Objection, or Customs role in respect of those Notices, should contact the Customs Information and Support 
Centre on 1300 363 263 or the Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6275 6577.

Indexation of certain excise and customs tariff duty rates - February 
2007 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December Quarter 2006 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 24 January 2007.  In accordance with the indexation provisions of the 
Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995, the rates of excise and customs duties 
on spirits, beer (except “home brew”) and tobacco will increase on 1 February 2007.  The new 
rates are set out in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Attachment to this Notice.   

The new rates of excise and customs duty listed in the Attachment are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, i.e. the December Quarter 2006 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
December 2006 index number (155.5) has been divided by the June 2006 index number 
(154.3) to establish an indexation factor of 1.008.  As this factor is more than one, rates of 
excise and customs duty have been increased by the application of this factor.

The Copyright Act 1968 allows the owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, to object to the

claimed is also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Copyright Notices of Objection is available at

Goods identified by Customs at the border as potentially infringing copyright are liable to be seized by 
Customs unless it can be established that:

- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc); or 
the goods do not infringe the copyright. 

People who are intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2007-10.pdf,Cargo reporting procedure for high volume low value consignments,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2007/10 

Cargo reporting procedure for high volume low value consignments 

This advice supersedes Australian Customs Notice 2000/23. 

The implementation of the imports provisions of the Customs Legislation Amendment and 
Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001 (ITM Act) limited the cargo reporting 
procedures for certain categories of import cargo that may be described as high volume low 
value cargo to bulk mail order consignments. This means the practice of reporting reportable 
documents, in bulk, under a sub master air waybill abbreviated report as previously advised, is 
no longer be acceptable and must be treated like general cargo.  

Overview 

The High Volume Low Value (HVLV) Scheme is designed to facilitate the reporting and 
clearance of eligible bulk mail order goods, thereby reducing Customs screening workload and 
minimising delivery delays.  

The Scheme provides for the reporting of high volume low value cargo consignments in 
accordance with section 64AB of the Customs Act 1901 (“the Act”), without cost recovery 
charges. It enables a cargo reporter of high volume low value consignments registered under 
the Scheme (to be known as a “special reporter”) to make abbreviated reports of eligible 
consignments at the sub-master air waybill (SMAWB) level.   

Such a report may be made by transmitting minimal details to the Integrated Cargo System 
(ICS)  - provided the consignment details, which would otherwise have been reported to 
Customs, are available not less than 2 hours prior to the arrival of the aircraft and are retained 
by the special reporter within its own electronic recording system.  

However, on request, special reporters will be required to electronically download information at 
the consignment level to Customs ahead of aircraft arrival for screening and targeting purposes. 

A key objective of the Scheme is to facilitate the provision of real time information, where 
required, to allow Customs to risk assess consignment details for community protection 
purposes. In addition, Customs officers have specific monitoring powers to access a special 
reporter’s premises, subject to the consent of the special reporter, to screen and audit all 
consignment details reported under the Scheme. 

The nature of high volume low value cargo 

Low value cargo means each consignment must have a value of less than $1000 and therefore 
not subject to entry requirements (Regulation 31AC of the Customs Regulation 1926). 

Such low value consignments comprise of consignments from a particular mail order house. 

A mail order house is defined in section 63A of the Act as a commercial establishment carrying 
on business outside Australia that sells goods solely in response to orders placed with it, either 
by mail or electronic means. 

High volume relates to the volume criteria an applicant must meet to be able to be registered as

Cargo reporting procedure for re-mail consignments 

This advice supersedes Australian Customs Notice 2003/17. 

This Notice details cargo reporting procedures in accordance with section 67F of the Customs 
Act 1901 (the Act) relating to the reporting of re-mail consignments to Customs.  

The Act defines re-mail items as follows: 

a re-mail item, in relation to a ship or aircraft, means an item of cargo carried on the 
ship or aircraft, in respect of which all of the following apply: 

(a) the item is packaged in an addressed envelope, of paper or other material, 
whose length plus width does not exceed 80 cm; 

(b) the item consists only of paper; 
(c) the item and packaging weigh no more than one kilogram; 
(d) the item either has no commercial value or is a publication in respect of which 
the following apply: 

(i) the publication is sent from overseas to the addressee as a subscriber to 
the publication; 

(ii) the subscription is made by a direct dealing with the consignor by either 
the addressee or another person arranging a gift subscription for the 
addressee; 
(iii) the value of the publication does not exceed $1000 (or such other 
amount as is prescribed for the purposes of subparagraph 68(1)(f)(iii)); 

(e) the item is not mail (the items cannot be consigned through the post at point of 
origin); 

(f) the item is not, or does not contain, goods covered by paragraph (a) or (b) of 
the definition of prohibited goods in subsection 4(1); 
(g) there is no individual document of carriage (consignment note or air waybill) 
for the item; 

(h) the item was consigned on the ship or aircraft by the consignor, with other 
items that are covered by paragraphs (a) to (g) of this definition, to different 
consignees (that is the items must all have one consignor and a unique 
addressee). 

Re-mail operators should note that the above definition states that no re-mail item may weigh 
more than one kilogram. This may mean a change of business practice for some operators. 
Items weighing more than one kilogram, along with any item that does not meet all of the 
parameters above, must be reported to Customs in full detail as a normal consignment line. 

The Act restricts those cargo reporters eligible to make a report of re-mail at the sub-master or 
bulk level. In order to be eligible a cargo reporter must apply to be registered under Subdivision 
E as a re-mail reporter. A person, body corporate or partnership may apply to be registered. 
Applications must be in writing on the approved form.

development of nuclear weapon delivery systems 

The following amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 and the 
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 relating to Iran will come into effect on 20 
February 2007. 

UNSC Sanctions 
UNSC Resolution 1737 obliges Member States to take steps to prevent the direct or indirect 
supply, sale or transfer of all items, materials, equipment, goods and technology which could 
contribute to Iran’s nuclear enrichment-related, reprocessing or heavy water-related activities.  
The Resolution also includes obligations to prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer 
of all items, materials, equipment, goods and technology which could contribute to the 
development of nuclear weapon delivery systems 

As a result, Regulation 13CQ of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 has been 
introduced with effect from 20 February 2007.  This regulation prohibits the exportation to Iran, 
without the written permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, of the following: 

•  Non-nuclear materials for reactors; 
•  Plants for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements and equipment especially designed 

or prepared for such reprocessing; 

•  Plants for the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel elements, and equipment especially 

designed or prepared for such fabrication; 

•  Plants for the separation of isotopes of uranium and equipment, other than analytical 

instruments, especially designed or prepared for such separation;  

•  Vacuum systems and pumps, special shut-off and control valves, UF6 mass 

spectrometers/ion sources, and UF6 /carrier gas separation systems; 

•  Plants for the production or concentration of heavy water, deuterium and deuterium 

compounds and equipment especially designed or prepared for such plants; 

•  Plants for the conversion of uranium or plutonium for use in the fabrication of fuel elements 
and the separation of uranium isotopes and equipment especially designed or prepared for 
such including plants. 

Included in the prohibited exports are “source material” and “special fissionable material” as 
defined in Article XX of the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency except for low-
enriched uranium when it is incorporated in assembled nuclear fuel elements for light water 
reactors.  In addition, nuclear reactors and especially designed or prepared equipment and 
components for such reactors, except for equipment and components for light water reactors, 
are also subject to export prohibitions.

Notices of Objection to Importation - Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of a trade 
mark to lodge a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs), objecting to the importation of 
goods which infringe their trade mark.  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force for a period of four 
years (effective 23 October 2006) from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of 
Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since January 2007 (ACN 2007/06).  Descriptions of the relevant trade 
marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=493

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  This 
refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a 
description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  
Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any Notice 
of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject to the 
control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs if: 

− 

− 

they have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively 
similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  
are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

unless it can be established that the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may not, 
amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has been 
applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, where the 
trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark and the goods are imported 
into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as 
to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical with"", 
""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

Where a registered trade mark owner or an authorised user with a current Notice of Objection in place request 
additional trade marks to be added to their Notice, only the additional trade marks are included at the end of this 
ACN.  The inclusion of additional trade marks in the ACN is to ensure that ACN subscribers have all the 
appropriate up-to-date information. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of each 
State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of 
Objection, or Customs role in respect of those Notices, should contact the Customs Information and Support 
Centre on 1300 363 263 or the Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6275 6577.

MATURATION CERTIFICATES FOR SPIRITOUS BEVERAGES : 
APPROVED ISSUING AUTHORITIES  

This ACN provides additional information to ACN 2006/33 dated 27 June 2006.  

Section 105A of the Customs Act 1901 requires that imported brandy, rum or whisky must be 
matured in wood for a minimum of two years before delivery from Customs control.  This covers all 
such beverages classified under tariff classifications 2208.20.10, 2208.30.00 and 2208.40.00. 

The Australian Customs Service (Customs) will accept evidence of the maturation of imported 
brandy, whisky, and rum from a government approved authority in the country of origin.  The 
evidence should be in the form of a certification (either in documentary or electronic form) from the 
approved authority confirming the maturation period and country of origin as well as identifying the 
consignment by reference to the supplier, final consignee, description and quantity and any other 
distinguishing features.  

Attached to this ACN is a listing of those government approved authorities from which Customs will 
accept certification for imports of brandy, rum or whisky produced in their respective countries.  In 
the absence of a reference to an approved authority for a specific country of origin, then Customs 
will accept maturation certification from the customs and excise authority in that country. 

If an importer cannot provide an authorised certification for imported brandy, rum or whisky then 
the goods will not be cleared from Customs control.  This requirement applies to goods entered 
directly into home consumption as well as those entered from a warehouse.  It is the responsibility 
of all importers of brandy, rum or whisky to be aware of the requirements to clear the goods from 
Customs control.

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of 
a trade mark to lodge a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs), objecting to the 
importation of goods which infringe their trade mark.  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of 
Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since January 2007 (ACN 2007/06).  Descriptions of the 
relevant trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=493 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  
This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and 
along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade 
mark is registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs 
regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject 
to the control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs 
if: 

− 

− 

they  have  applied  to  them,  or  in  relation  to  them,  a  sign  that  is  substantially  identical  with,  or 
deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  
are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

unless it can be established that the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or 
may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question 
has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  
However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark 
and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may 
still represent an infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of 
the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal 
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as

Where a registered trade mark owner or an authorised user with a current Notice of Objection in place

the end of this ACN.  The inclusion of additional trade marks in the ACN is to ensure that ACN subscribers 
have all the appropriate up-to-date information.

The current rates for each card type are: 

•  VISA 0.92 % 
•  MasterCard 0.92%

United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1747: 
Sanctions on the import of arms or related matériel from Iran 

An amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the Regulations) 
implementing further sanctions against Iran imposed by UNSC Resolution 1747 (2007) takes 
effect on 15 May 2007.  

UNSC Resolution 1747 further extends UNSC Resolution 1737 (2006) by expanding financial 
sanctions against Iran, imposing an embargo on the transfer of arms or related matériel from 
Iran, and calls upon all states to exercise vigilance and restraint in transferring certain arms or 
related matériel to Iran. 

ACN 2007/12 provides further information on UNSC Resolution 1737 (2006) which imposes 
sanctions on the import and export of all items, materials, equipment, goods and technology 
which could contribute to Iran’s nuclear enrichment-related, reprocessing or heavy-water 
activities, or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems. 

New paragraph 4Z(c) of the Regulations, inserted by the Customs (Prohibited Imports) 
Amendment Regulations 2007 (No.2), gives effect to Resolution 1747.  The amended regulation 
prohibits the importation of arms and related matériel from Iran without the written permission of 
the Minister for Foreign Affairs or an authorised person.  Permission must be produced to 
Customs before goods are cleared for importation.   

All importers, exporters, customs brokers and freight forwarders must use the Country Code IR, 
when reporting to Customs the importation or exportation of goods to or from Iran.  Errors in 
country codes will lead to delays in the clearance of cargo.  Inquiries concerning this notice may 
be directed to the Manager, Counter Proliferation on telephone number (02) 6275 6189, or fax

Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2007 – certain steel wire 
imported under the Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement 

Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2007 (the Proposal) was tabled in Parliament on 31 May 2007 
and contains minor alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff). 

The Proposal removes the 4% customs duty imposed under Schedule 6 of the Tariff on “low 
relaxation prestressed concrete steel wire, ribbed or indented” classified to subheading 
7217.10.00 in Schedule 3 of the Tariff and imported under the Thailand-Australia Free Trade 
Agreement (TAFTA).  These alterations will take effect on and from 1 June 2007. 

Under TAFTA, the above customs duty rate of 4% was due to be phased to a rate of Free on 
1 January 2010.  The early elimination of this rate will reduce input costs for Australian 
industry and users of the above steel wire. 

In the Integrated Cargo System, the rate of customs duty of Free for low relaxation 
prestressed concrete steel wire, ribbed or indented classified to tariff subheading 7217.10.00 
and imported under TAFTA, will be accessed by the use of Rate Number 02.  The Preference 
Scheme to be quoted on the import declaration is TH, and a Preference Rule of either WO 
(Wholly Obtained) or PS (Product Specific) must also be quoted. 

To qualify for the preferential duty rate, a valid TAFTA certificate of origin is required from the 
Department of Foreign Trade in Thailand (refer to ACN 2004/51).  Other goods classified 
under subheading 7217.10.00, and imported under TAFTA, will continue to use Rate 
Number 01 that will provide the present rate of customs duty of 4%. 

This amendment will not impact on the rates of customs duty applicable to other steel wire 
products also classified to subheading 7217.10.00 nor will it affect existing arrangements for 
other importers of steel wire products. 

Customs Tariff pages to be issued in connection with these changes are: Customs Tariff Act 
page 15 (R.17) and Schedule 6 page 6/73 (R.2).

Revised procedures:  Loading and Unloading of Goods (other 
than cargo) onto/off ships. 

This notice details the reporting procedures required for loading and unloading ship’s stores. 

Commencing 12 June 2007 all applications to load ships stores and remove goods (other than 
cargo) from ships must be made to Customs using the following forms:  

(cid:131)  Request to Load Goods (Other Than Cargo) onto Ship (FORM 43) 
(cid:131)  Request to remove Goods (Other Than Cargo) from Ship (FORM 44) 

Both forms are available from the media, publications and forms section of the Customs Internet 
located at www.customs.gov.au.  

Request to Load Goods (Other than Cargo) onto Ship (FORM 43)  

Section 129 of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) requires that before stores are loaded on board 
a ship an approval by Customs is obtained.  The Request to Load Ships Stores (FORM 43) is 
the only form authorised by Customs as the means of gaining that approval. 

Failure to gain an approval under section 129 of the Act may result in seizure of the stores as 
prohibited exports.   

Application Procedures 
Completed Form 43 applications should be forwarded to Customs in the port where the ship is 
berthed.  Applications can only be signed by the master, owner or agent and must clearly show 
the name and signature of the person requesting the approval.  Where an application is sent 
electronically and therefore unable to be signed, the name of the person requesting the 
approval should also be printed in the signature field.  Electronic applications should also show 
a recognised E-mail address.  Failure to provide the required details may result in the approval 
being delayed while clarification is obtained. 

It is anticipated that approved applications will be returned within one working day of receipt and 
will be faxed back to the person who lodged the form.  Should an application not be approved 
the applicant will be notified of the decision accordingly. 

To assist in the approval process the information provided to Customs should be brief and 
concise.  However where an Export Declaration Number (EDN) is required, for example when 
the individual value of each item exceeds $2000, a detailed description of the goods should be 
made.  Failure to fully describe these goods may result in approval being refused or delayed 
while clarification is obtained. 

Loading Procedures 
Prior to the review of procedures relating to the loading and unloading of ship stores, ship’s 
spares, ship’s equipment and goods required to service cargo such as fuel for generators were 
treated by Customs as general cargo and therefore had separate loading procedures.  These 
cargo types will now be treated as ship’s stores.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 
1958 Export of Human Embryos 

Regulation 7 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (the Prohibited Exports 
Regulations) that prohibits the exportation of human embryos without the permission of the 
Minister for Justice and Customs will be repealed on 12 June 2007. 

The Prohibition of Human Cloning Act 2002 and the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 
2002 were reviewed by a Committee chaired by Justice Lockhart AO QC.  Following this review, 
Parliament passed the Prohibition of Human Cloning for Reproduction and the Regulation of 
Human Embryo Research Amendment Act 2006 (the Act) on 7 December 2006.  This Act 
implements recommendations from the Lockhart review and takes effect on 12 June 2007. 

Schedule 4 of the Act repeals Regulation 7 of the Prohibited Exports Regulations on 12 June 
2007. 

From that date, the control on the exportation of human embryos will revert to the previous 
export control under Regulation 8 (Item 1, Schedule 6) of the Prohibited Exports Regulations.  
This item prohibits, without permission, the exportation of human body fluids, organs and other 
tissue, including a part or constituent of material of that kind, if the internal volume of the 
immediate container in which the material is packed exceeds 50ml.   

Accordingly, the exportation of human embryos shipped in a container where the internal 
volume does not exceed 50ml will not require an export permission under Regulation 8 of the 
Prohibited Exports Regulations.

Notices of Objection to Importation  
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of 
a trade mark to lodge a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs), objecting to the 
importation of goods which infringe their trade mark.  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in 
force for a period of four years (effective 23 October 2006) from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of 
Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since May 2007 (ACN 2007/23).  Descriptions of the relevant 
trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=4683

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  
This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and 
along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade 
mark is registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs 
regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject 
to the control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs 
if: 

− 

− 

they  have  applied  to  them,  or  in  relation  to  them,  a  sign  that  is  substantially  identical  with,  or 
deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  
are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

unless it can be established that the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or 
may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question 
has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  
However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark 
and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may 
still represent an infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of 
the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal 
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as 
""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

Where a registered trade mark owner or an authorised user with a current Notice of Objection in place 
request additional trade marks to be added to their Notice, only the additional trade marks are included at 
the end of this ACN.  The inclusion of additional trade marks in the ACN is to ensure that ACN subscribers 
have all the appropriate up-to-date information. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of 
each State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices 
of Objection, or Customs role in respect of those Notices, should contact the Customs Information and 
Support Centre on 1300 363 263 or the Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6275 6577.

Application for Sole Trader Broker’s Licence 

Under S183CA of the Customs 1901, a nominee customs broker may apply for a sole trader 
broker’s licence.  Applications must be supported by the following documents: 

(cid:190) Application for Customs Brokers licence (Form B738); 
(cid:190) Consent to Obtain Personal Information (Form B195); 
(cid:190) Evidence of Identity that totals 100 points or more; and 
(cid:190) Evidence of the applicant’s financial standing. 

This evidence of financial standing may be in the form of certified balance sheets, profit and 
loss statements, financial references, evidence of any overdraft facility or any other official 
documentation that would further demonstrate that the applicant will be operating from a sound 
financial base. 

An applicant for a sole trader broker’s licence should also consider taking out professional 
indemnity insurance.  Evidence of the policy should be forwarded with the application. 

Following receipt of this documentation, an Australian Customs Notice (ACN) will be published 
notifying that an applicant has applied to be licensed as a sole trader. The ACN will seek 
comment within fourteen days and allows individuals or companies to lodge representations 
with Customs in regard to an application.  

Principles of procedural fairness in respect of information that is potentially adverse to the 
applicant will be applied and if information is received that is considered credible, relevant and 
significant, the applicant will be made aware of the substance of the representation and given 
the opportunity to respond to the representation.  

Appropriate integrity checks will be performed following receipt of the application and a signed 
Consent to Obtain Personal Information form. 

The application will then be examined by the National Customs Brokers Licensing Advisory 
Committee (the Committee) which has the responsibility of recommending to the Chief 
Executive Officer of Customs (CEO) whether or not the licence should be granted. 

The Committee will then make a recommendation to the CEO. 

Any questions regarding the process should be directed to Broker Licensing on (02) 6275 5784 
or by email at brokers.licensing@customs.gov.au.

Notices of Objection to Importation 
Copyright Act 1968 

The Copyright Act 1968 allows the owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, to object to the importation 
of goods that infringe copyright.  The owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, does this by lodging a 
Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection 
remains in force for a period of four years from the date of commencement.    

The attached Schedule sets out the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, who have lodged a Notice of 
Objection under the Copyright Act 1968 since February 2007 (ACN 2007/09).  The Notices notify the objections 
of the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, to the importation of goods that infringe their copyright. A 
description of where copyright is claimed is also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Copyright Notices of Objection is available at 
www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=4497. 

Goods identified by Customs at the border as potentially infringing copyright are liable to be seized by Customs 
unless it can be established that: 

- 
- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc); or 
the goods do not infringe the copyright. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Copyright Act 1968 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, as 
to the implications of the copyright legislation. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of 
each State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2007-36.pdf,Importation of asbestos or goods containing asbestos,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2007/36 

Importation of asbestos or goods containing asbestos 

This Notice has been issued to remind importers and their agents of the import control that 
applies to asbestos, or goods containing asbestos. 

Asbestos (chrysotile and amphibole) and goods containing asbestos are controlled under 
Regulation 4C and Schedule 3B of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956.  
Permission can only be granted to import such products in limited circumstances.  

Recently, Customs has made detections of goods found to contain asbestos.  These goods are 
prohibited imports as they do not meet the requirements of Regulation 4C and Schedule 3B.  
The importation of a prohibited import is an offence under the Customs Act 1901. 

Importers are reminded that they bear responsibility to ensure that imported goods comply with 
Commonwealth, State and Territory legislative requirements.  Care should be taken when 
sourcing imported products that the goods comply with Australian law.   

Any certification issued by overseas suppliers is not, of itself, a guarantee that the goods 
comply to Australian standards or laws.  Australian law does not allow any tolerance for 
asbestos and therefore any imports containing items of this nature are considered prohibited 
imports. 

Customs has recently increased its monitoring of goods that may pose a risk of having asbestos 
components, particularly those containing brake and/or clutch parts, and gaskets.  We have 
also been working closely with State and Territory regulatory authorities in relation to this issue. 

The importer of any goods found to be in contravention of Australian law will be liable for any 
costs incurred with regard to their testing, storage, replacement of parts or disposal. 

Importing agents are encouraged to alert clients, who may be importing goods at risk of 
containing asbestos, of their obligations. 

For any additional information regarding Customs import requirements, please refer to the 
Customs website www.customs.gov.au or contact the Customs Information & Support Centre 
on 1300 363 263. 

Inquiries concerning this Notice may be directed to the Manager, Community Protection on 
telephone number (02) 6275 6129 or fax number (02) 6229 3840.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2007-38.pdf,Aircraft spares imported for foreign owned aircraft,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2007/38 

Aircraft spares imported for foreign owned aircraft. 

This notice details the various options available for treating aircraft spares imported for foreign 
owned aircraft under the Integrated Cargo System (ICS).  The use of these options take effect 
from 5 August 2007. 

Introduction 
Customs legislation requires all imported goods, including spare parts for foreign owned aircraft, 
to be reported.  Previously companies operating foreign owned aircraft have been allowed to 
import spare parts using transhipment entries. However, under the ICS, transhipment entries 
have been replaced by cargo reports.  Accordingly, spare parts for foreign owned aircraft must 
be reported to Customs by lodging a cargo report in ICS.   In effect, the cargo report is a 
recognised method of transhipment by the reporting of an overseas destination for the spare 
parts.   

If the overseas destination is not known at the time the spare parts are sent to Australia, the 
importer is required to lodge an import declaration and pay the applicable customs duty and 
Goods and Services Tax (GST) liability.   Spare parts may be imported exempt from customs 
duty if they meet the conditions of Item 31 of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995. 

Options for importation 
The table below is a summary of various options for importation and the GST impact. 

Option 

GST status 

Comment 

1.  Transhipment of parts going 

directly onto foreign owned 
aircraft. 

GST not payable as the 
parts are not destined 
for Australia. 

2. 

Importer is registered under 
the TRADEX scheme.  This 
option requires the goods to 
be intended for export within 
12 months of their 
importation.  This option 
requires an entry using 
concessional Item 21A of the 
Customs Tariff Act 1995.   

A non- taxable 
importation as per 
section 42-5(1) of A 
New Tax System 
(Goods and Services 
Tax) Act (1999). 

3.  Formal (electronic) entry into 
home consumption where 
the importer registered for 
the GST deferral scheme.   

GST payable but is 
deferred as per section 
33-15.02 of A New Tax 
System (Goods and 
Services Tax) 
Regulations (1999).  

Only applicable for genuine 
transhipments, when aircraft spares 
imported in Australia for a temporary 
period will be exported within a known 
timeframe. (Cargo reported or moved 
underbond for export).  
The TRADEX scheme is administered 
by AusIndustry, a division within DITR. 
More information regarding registration 
can be located on 
www.ausindustry.gov.au or contact the 
AusIndustry Hotline on telephone 
number 13 28 46.  
An Export Declaration would be 
required to be made or such other 
records required by the Department of 
Industry, Tourism and Resources 
(DITR). 
Most foreign airlines operating flights to 
Australia have an Australian Business 
Number (ABN) and some are also 
registered as clients in ICS using their 
ABN.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2007-40.pdf,Indexation of certain customs and excise tariff duty rates – August 2007,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2007/40 

Indexation of certain customs and excise tariff duty rates – August 2007 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June Quarter 2007 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 25 July 2007.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in section 19 
of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the rates of 
customs and excise duties on spirits, beer (except “home brew”) and tobacco will increase on 
1 August 2007.  The new rates are set out in tables 1 to 4 of this Notice.   

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, i.e. the June Quarter 2007 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
June 2007 index number (157.5) has been divided by the December 2006 index number 
(155.5) to establish an indexation factor of 1.013.  As this factor is more than one, rates of 
customs and excise duty have been increased by the application of this factor.

INCREASE IN FOREST AND WOOD PRODUCTS RESEARCH 
LEVY AND CHARGE 

This Notice is to advise that amendments to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Regulation 
1999, (the Regulations) have been approved which will increase the levy and charge on hardwood 
sawlogs by 7 cents per cubic metre.   The rate will change from 22 cents per cubic metre to 29 
cents per cubic metre, achieving equity between the hardwood and softwood sectors. 

With respect to imported forest products, sub-section 3(1) of the Primary Industries (Customs) 
Charges Act 1999 links charge rates on imported forest products proportionally to rates levied on 
domestically produced equivalents through the use of class conversion factors without alteration of 
those conversion factors. 

As a result of increasing levy rates on certain domestic classes of forest products there will be a 
proportionate increase in rates levied on imported equivalents. 

The rates listed in the Attachment will take effect on 20 August 2007.

Increase to the Luxury Car Tax Threshold 

This notice is to advise of the recent increase in the Luxury Car Tax (LCT) threshold.  The 
Australian Taxation Office has advised that, as of 1 July 2007, the Luxury Car Tax threshold has 
increased to $57,123 for the 2007-08 financial year.    

Any motor vehicle defined as a ‘luxury car’ in A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 
with a value above $57,123 is subject to luxury car tax on the portion of its value that exceeds 
the threshold. The LCT is imposed on luxury cars at the retail level and is calculated in addition 
to any GST that may be payable. 

All related information within the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) has been updated to reflect the 
new threshold.  For processing within the ICS, in cases where the LCT value exceeds the LCT 
threshold: 

•  each entry line must have one car only; and 
•  each entry line must be dealt with in one of the following ways:  

- 
- 
- 

by quoting the importer’s valid Australian Business Number (ABN), or 
use a valid exemption code, or 
pay the LCT. 

Where LCT is not applicable, importers do not need quote their ABN to claim exemption or 
separately claim another exemption type. In these circumstances, importers may include 
several cars on a single entry line.

Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2007 

The Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2007 received the Royal Assent on 
20 August 2007, as Act No. 133 of 2007.  The Act amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 by 
enacting the following changes: 

1.  Subheading 2916.36.00 has been repealed and the chemical binapacryl is now classified 
to new subheading 2916.19.20.  The separate identification of this chemical is required 
under the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain 
Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, to which Australia is a 
signatory.  This measure came into effect on the day that the Act received the Royal 
Assent, this being 20 August 2007. 

2.  Prepared culture media for the development or maintenance of viruses has been 
reclassified to subheading 3821.00.90, which has a customs duty rate of “Free”.  
This measure was implemented through Special Gazette No. S222 of 15 December 2006 
and then included in Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) of 2007, which was tabled in 
the House of Representatives on 15 February 2007.  This measure took effect on 
1 January 2007, and the Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2007 gives legal effect to

Amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
Regulation 4AA – Importation of Plastic Explosives 

The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 has been amended to insert a new 
regulation 4AA which controls the importation of plastic explosives.  New regulation 4AA 
commenced on 25 August 2007.   

Regulation 4AA complements amendments made to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Criminal 
Code) by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Marking of Plastic Explosives) Act 2007 
which gives effect to Australia’s international obligations under the United Nations Convention on 
the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection (Montreal, 1991).  The new import 
control on plastic explosives in regulation 4AA forms an integral part of the new control on plastic 
explosives provided in new Subdivision B of Division 72 of the Criminal Code.   

Regulation 4AA prohibits the importation into Australia of plastic explosives unless written 
permission has been granted by the Attorney-General or an authorised person of the Attorney-
General’s Department, and the permission is produced to the Collector of Customs.  

A  plastic  explosive  is  taken  to  mean  an  explosive  product  (including  an  explosive 
product in flexible or elastic sheet form) that is:  
formulated with: 
(i)    one  or  more  high  explosives  which  in  their  pure  form  have  a 
vapour  pressure  less  than  10¯4  Pa  at  a  temperature  of  25°C; 
and 

(a) 

(b) 

(ii)  a binder material; and 
as a mixture, malleable or flexible at normal room temperature.  

The meaning of ‘plastic explosive’ is the same as in new Subdivision B of Division 72 
of the Criminal Code. 

Intending importers of plastic explosives will be required to submit an Application for 
Permission to Import Plastic Explosives and provide a Manufacturers Certificate as 
evidence of whether the plastic explosive is marked or unmarked. 

The exportation of plastic explosives will continue to be controlled by regulation 13E 
of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958. 

The Attorney-General’s Department is the policy agency for this control and further 
information and access to the necessary forms can be obtained from the website 
http://www.ag.gov.au.

Regulations amending the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (Customs PI 
Regulations) were registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments on 24 August 
2007 and commenced on 25 August 2007.  

Heavy metal levels 

Subregulation 4(1) of the Customs PI Regulations prohibits the importation into Australia of 
goods specified in Schedule 2 unless the permission in writing to import the goods has been 
granted by the Minister for Justice and Customs or an authorised person. 

The toxicological levels of the heavy metals in items 2 (toys), 6 (money boxes), 7 (pencils and 
paintbrushes) and 34 (erasers resembling food in scent or appearance) of Schedule 2 to the 
Customs PI Regulations have been amended by the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment 
Regulations 2007 (No. 3) (the amending regulations) to reflect the levels published in the latest 
Australian/New Zealand Standard: AS/NZS ISO 8124.3:2003 ‘Safety of toys, Part 3: Migration 
of certain elements’, published on 23 May 2003.    

Rough diamonds from Liberia 

Regulation 4P of the Customs PI Regulations prohibited the importation absolutely of rough 
diamonds from Liberia whether or not the diamonds originated from Liberia.  Regulation 4P was 
introduced to give effect to the ban imposed pursuant to United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 1521 (2003). 

On 27 April 2007, the President of the Security Council announced that this import ban had 
been lifted and consequently the import ban imposed by Australia was no longer necessary.   

The amending regulations remove the prohibition on the importation of rough diamonds from 
Liberia by repealing regulation 4P of the Customs PI Regulations.  The importation of rough 
diamonds from Liberia will be subject to the requirement that the relevant Kimberley Process 
Certificate is provided under regulation 4MA of the Customs PI Regulations. 

Round logs and timber products from Liberia 

Regulation 4Q of the Customs PI Regulations prohibited the importation of round logs and 
timber products from Liberia without the written permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or 
an authorised person. 

This regulation was introduced to give effect to the ban imposed pursuant to United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 1521 (2003).  

On 20 June 2006, the President of the Security Council announced that this import ban would 
not be renewed and consequently the ban imposed by Australia on the importation of round

Notices of Objection to Importation  
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of 
a trade mark to lodge a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs), objecting to the 
importation of goods which infringe their trade mark.  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in 
force for a period of four years (effective 23 October 2006) from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of 
Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since June 2007 (ACN 2007/32).  Descriptions of the relevant 
trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current trade mark Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
www.customs.gov.au > media publications and forms> Customs notices > Intellectual Property – Notices of 
Objection > trade marks 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  
This refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and 
along with a description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade 
mark is registered.  Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs 
regarding the ambit of any Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject 
to the control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs 
if: 
− 

they  have  applied  to  them,  or  in  relation  to  them,  a  sign  that  is  substantially  identical  with,  or 
deceptively similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  
are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

− 
unless it can be established that the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or 
may not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question 
has been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  
However, where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark 
and the goods are imported into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may 
still represent an infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of 
the Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal 
practitioner, as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as 
""substantially identical with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

Where a registered trade mark owner or an authorised user with a current Notice of Objection in place 
request additional trade marks to be added to their Notice, only the additional trade marks are included at 
the end of this ACN.  The inclusion of additional trade marks in the ACN is to ensure that ACN subscribers 
have all the appropriate up-to-date information. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of 
each State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices 
of Objection, or Customs role in respect of those Notices, should contact the Customs Information and 
Support Centre on 1300 363 263 or the Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6275 6577.

Revocation of Tariff Concession Orders for Certain Finished 
Textile Products 

Schedule 2 of the Customs Regulations 1926 has been amended to list certain finished textile 
products, including bed linen, toilet and kitchen linen.  Schedule 2 lists those goods, by 
reference to their tariff classification, for which a Tariff Concession Order (TCO) cannot be 
granted.  These amendments to the Regulations will take effect on and from Thursday 
4 October 2007. 

Attachment A to this ACN lists the tariff classifications affected by this change. 

In a number of cases, there are existing TCOs in force in relation to the finished textile products.  
These TCOs are listed in Attachment B to this ACN.  Under subsection 269SJ(2) of the 
Customs Act 1901, these TCOs will be deemed to be revoked on the day the amendments take 
effect.  Importers of the goods covered by these TCOs will be required to pay the general rate of 
duty from that date.   

This change has occurred as part of the Government’s Textile, Clothing and Footwear (TCF) 
Post-2005 Assistance Package.  The amendments will restore the integrity of the domestic 
assistance plan and also ensure that industry participants are treated equitably.   

A revision of the Schedule of Concessional Instruments Part I will be issued as soon as 
possible. 

Further information on the TCF Post-2005 Assistance Package may be obtained from the 
Manager, TCF Policy Group, Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources, Canberra on 
telephone (02) 6213 6868.  Customs inquiries may be directed to the Manager, Tariff Policy,

Special Safeguards on Canned Pineapple from Thailand 

By Notice published in the Commonwealth Gazette on 17 October 2007, and 
registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments, the Minister for 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has imposed special safeguards on imports of 
canned pineapple from Thailand. The provisions derive from Article 509 of the 
Thailand – Australia Free Trade Agreement and relate to canned pineapple classified 
under tariff subheading 2008.20.00 (Statistical codes 26 and 27).   

The effect of the provisions is that instead of being free of duty, all canned pineapple 
imported from Thailand will attract the general rate of duty of 5% from 18 October 
2007 until 31 December 2007 (Preference Scheme ‘GEN’ in ICS), unless ‘in-transit’ 
provisions apply (Preference Scheme ‘THSS’ in ICS).  Please also refer to ACN 2005/27 
for more information on claiming preferential rates of duty in the ICS. 

To qualify for ‘in-transit’ provisions, the goods must meet the requirements of being 
Thai originating, have a valid Thai Certificate of Origin at time of importation, and be 
exported from Thailand on or before 17 October 2007, under a contract entered into 
on or before 17 October 2007. 

The safeguards will cease to apply to goods imported on or after 1 January 2008, but 
may be re-imposed if the limit of 7,042,061 litres is reached in 2008.  Customs will 
provide further advice to importers if that occurs. 

Please note that special safeguards have not been imposed on imports of non-canned 
pineapple classified under tariff subheading 2008.20.00 (Statistical code 28). 
Preference Scheme ‘TH’ in ICS is to be used to receive the preferential duty rate for 
these goods. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to origin@customs.gov.au, or to the 
Valuation  and  Origin  Section  on  telephone  number  (02)  6275  6556,  or  fax  number

Amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 
Regulation 9 and Schedule 7 – Exportation of Nuclear Material 

The Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 have been amended to clarify the nuclear

consistency between the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 and the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987.  The amendments commended on 29th September 2007.   

The term source materials refers to any material from which special fissionable material may be 
produced.  Item 1 of Schedule 7 specifies the source materials that are subject to export 
controls and exemptions to those controls.   

The amendments add tantalum concentrates and tantalum glass to Item 1.  The amendments 
also provide an exemption for any ore or concentrate containing less than 0.05% by weight of 
the identified types of uranium or thorium source materials unless the ore or concentrate is 
listed by the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources to be excluded from this exemption.

Amendments to the Customs Regulations 1926 - expanding the 
range of goods that can be sold in an inwards duty free shop 

The purpose of this Notice is to advise of changes to the Customs Regulations 1926 expanding the 
range of goods that can be sold in an inwards duty free shop.   

The amended regulations remove the restrictions on the range of goods that can be sold in inwards 
duty free shops.  Previously only eight classes of goods including alcoholic liquor, tobacco products, 
photographic film and perfumes could be sold in an inwards duty free shop.  

It is important to note that this regulation amendment makes no changes to the passenger 
concession amounts.  This means that whatever is actually purchased by inward passengers from 
the expanded range of goods at inwards duty free shops will still be added to their outwards duty free 
and overseas purchases for the purposes of calculating a passenger's duty concession entitlement.  
If any of the passenger concessions are exceeded, Customs will charge duty and tax on the entire 
importation or purchase within that group of items.   The current passenger concession amounts are 
set out at the end of this notice. 

The amendment allows for goods to be sold in an inwards duty free shop that meet the following 
criteria: 

(a) alcoholic beverages;   
(b) tobacco products; and  
(c) goods which have all of the following characteristics: 

(i) no more than $900 in value;  
(ii) no more than 7kg in weight;  
(iii) no more than 56cm in length, 36cm in height and 23cm in depth.   

The $900 value restriction on an individual item has been specified as it is identical to the current 
duty free concession for general goods for an individual traveller.  The size and weight restriction on 
an individual item has been imposed so that a traveller is able, on arrival, to access goods that they 
may otherwise have purchased overseas and brought in hand luggage to Australia.  

The following goods are excluded from the goods that can be sold in an inwards duty free shop: 

(a)  
(b)  

(c)  
(d)  
(e)  
(f)  

alcoholic beverages that are not in sealed containers; 
food and beverages which are capable of immediate consumption, other than 
commercially produced confectionery which is in sealed packaging and alcoholic 
beverages that are in sealed containers;  
fresh or dried fruits;  
fresh or dried vegetables;  
live plants; and  
fresh or dried cut flowers.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and 
the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958  

Terrorist Material 

Regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
(PI Regulations) and Regulation 3 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 
1958 (PE Regulations) prohibit without permission, respectively, the importation or 
exportation, of objectionable goods.   

In response to a Government initiative to ensure that material that advocates the doing 
of terrorist acts is not lawfully available within Australia, amendments to Regulation 
4A of the PI Regulations and Regulation 3 of the PE regulations insert new 
prohibitions on the importation and exportation, respectively, of publications and 
goods which advocate the doing of a terrorist act.  The importation or exportation of 
such publications or goods are now prohibited unless the Attorney-General or an 
authorised person had given written permission to import or export the goods.  The 
amendments specify when a publication or good advocates, or does not advocate, the 
doing of a terrorist act and provides that the term ‘terrorist act’ has the same meaning 
as given to the term by section 100.1 of the Criminal Code.   

These amendments complement  recent amendments made to the Classification 
(Publication, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 which require publications, films 
or computer games that advocate the doing of terrorist act to be ‘Refused 
Classification’.   

The amending Regulations commenced on 20 October 2007.  

Enquiries regarding this notice may be directed to Community Protection Policy on 
telephone (02) 6275 6114 or via email to community.protection@customs.gov.au.

Notices of Objection to Importation 
Copyright Act 1968 

The Copyright Act 1968 allows the owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, to object to the 
importation of goods that infringe copyright.  The owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, does this 
by lodging a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice 
of Objection remains in force for a period of four years from the date of commencement.    

The attached Schedule sets out the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, who have lodged a Notice of 
Objection under the Copyright Act 1968 since June 2007 (ACN 2007/34).  The Notices notify the objections 
of the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, to the importation of goods that infringe their copyright. A 
description of where copyright is claimed is also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Copyright Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
www.customs.gov.au > media publications and forms> Customs notices > Intellectual Property – Notices of 
Objection > copyright 

Goods identified by Customs at the border as potentially infringing copyright are liable to be seized by 
Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 
- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc); or 
the goods do not infringe the copyright. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Copyright Act 1968 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, 
as to the implications of the copyright legislation. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of 
each State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices 
of Objection, or Customs’ role in respect of those Notices, should contact the Customs Information and 
Support Centre on 1300 363 263 or the Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6275 6577.

Maritime Crew Visa becomes mandatory 1 January 2008 

From 1 January 2008 it will be mandatory for all foreign sea crew (including supernumerary 
crew) visiting Australia to hold a visa.  The transitional arrangements, which have been in place 
since the Maritime Crew Visa (MCV) was introduced on 1 July 2007, will end on 31 December 
2007.  Foreign crew of non-military ships will no longer be eligible for the grant of a Special 
Purpose visa (SPV).  

Customs officers, together with Regional Seaports Officers from the Department of Immigration 
and Citizenship (DIAC) will be responsible for the administration and operation of these new 
arrangements at seaports around Australia. It is important that crew, masters, agents and 
operators of vessels arriving in Australia are aware of these requirements and take appropriate 
action, in particular they should be aware of the following: 

Penalties 
From 1 January 2008 crew who arrive in Australia without an MCV or other appropriate visa for 
crew will be restricted on board their vessel.  A penalties regime, administered by DIAC will 
apply in relation to crew arriving without visas. A penalty of $5000 for each case applies for 
Masters, agents and operators who bring crew to Australia without an MCV. 

From 1 January 2008 crew arriving by sea must hold:  
•  a valid national passport  
•  an MCV granted for the same passport, and 
•  another document that establishes the crew member’s employment on the vessel. For 

example, crew list, articles, seaman’s book, or contract.  

Vessels carrying crew without an MCV will be permitted to enter Australia. However crew without 
a valid visa will be restricted on board the ship. All vessels must wait until they are immigration 
cleared by Australian Customs before any crew leave the ship. Crew who hold a visa but leave 
the ship without being cleared may have their visa ceased and be restricted on board the vessel.  

Crew in Australia around 31 December 2007 
Crew  who  arrive  in  Australia  before  31  December  2007  without  an  MCV,  and who 
have not departed before 1 January 2008, are able to remain in Australia lawfully as 
the SPV remains valid until they depart. Once they have left Australia, they can then 
apply for the MCV.  

Apply now

Notices of Objection to Importation  
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of a 
trade mark to lodge a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs), objecting to the 
importation of goods which infringe their trade mark.  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force 
for a period of four years (effective 23 October 2006) from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of 
Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since October 2007 (ACN 2007/58).  Descriptions of the relevant 
trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current trade mark Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
www.customs.gov.au > media publications and forms> Customs notices > Intellectual Property – Notices of 
Objection > trade marks 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  This 
refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a 
description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  
Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any 
Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject to 
the control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs if: 
− 

they have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively 
similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  
are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

− 
unless it can be established that the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may 
not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has 
been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, 
where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark and the goods 
are imported into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an 
infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, 
as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical 
with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

Where a registered trade mark owner or an authorised user with a current Notice of Objection in place request 
additional trade marks to be added to their Notice, only the additional trade marks are included at the end of 
this ACN.  The inclusion of additional trade marks in the ACN is to ensure that ACN subscribers have all the 
appropriate up-to-date information. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of 
each State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of 
Objection, or Customs role in respect of those Notices, should contact the Customs Information and Support 
Centre on 1300 363 263 or the Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6275 6577.

Revocation of Customs Notice No. 1 (2007) - certain steel wire 
imported under the Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement 

Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2007 was tabled in Parliament on 31 May 2007.  The Proposal 
removed the 4% customs duty applicable to “low relaxation prestressed concrete steel wire, 
ribbed or indented” classified to subheading 7217.10.00 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the 
Tariff) and imported under the Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA).  These 
alterations took effect on 1 June 2007.  (ACN 2007/27 refers). 

To maintain the effect of the Tariff Proposal after the prorogation of Parliament in October 2007, 
Customs Tariff Notice No. 1 (2007) was published in Special Commonwealth Gazette No. S205 
of 16 October 2007. 

As a result of an internal review of the classification of the above steel wire, Customs now 
considers that these goods should be classified under heading 7215 of the Tariff.  This heading 
provides a free rate of duty for goods imported under TAFTA, including the steel wire in 
question.  Accordingly, Customs will formally revoke Customs Tariff Notice No. 1 (2007) by 
publication of a notice of revocation in the Commonwealth Gazette, of 6 February 2008.  The 
notice of revocation will take effect on and from gazettal. 

The revocation of Notice No. 1 (2007) will remove the Free rate of duty provided under 
subheading 7217.10.00 in Schedule 6 of the Tariff for “low relaxation prestressed concrete steel 
wire, ribbed or indented”.  This change will not affect rates of Customs duty applicable to other 
steel wire products also classified to subheading 7217.10.00. 

Customs Tariff pages will be issued in connection with the revocation of Customs Tariff Notice 
No. 1 (2007), as follows: Customs Tariff Act page 15 (R.18) and Schedule 6 page 6/73 (R.3).

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2008-06.pdf,Indexation of certain customs and excise tariff duty rates – February 2008,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2008/06 
Indexation of certain customs and excise tariff duty rates – February 2008 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December Quarter 2007 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 23 January 2008.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921, 
the rates of customs and excise duties on spirits, beer (except “home brew”) and tobacco 
will increase on 1 February 2008.  The new rates are set out in tables 1 to 4 of this Notice.   

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, ie the December Quarter 2007 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
December 2007 index number (160.1) has been divided by the June 2007 index number 
(157.5) to establish an indexation factor of 1.017.  As this factor is more than one, rates of 
customs and excise duty have been increased by the application of this factor. 

Any inquiries concerning these matters should be directed to:

Control permit for non-commercial foreign craft in Australia 

Customs  will  be  trialling  a  new  permit  system  for  non-commercial  foreign  craft  in  Australia.  
Control Permits will replace Cruising Permits that were previously granted to eligible smallcraft. 

Control  permits  are  granted  to  eligible  applicants  where  Customs  is  satisfied  that  the  craft  is 
transiting Australia for specified non-commercial purposes such as: 

cruising/touring purposes 

• 
•  mooring purposes 
recreational use 
• 
repair/refit 
• 
specified racing events 
• 

Persons eligible to apply for a control permit must hold a valid passport and visa and must be a 
tourist  or  temporary  resident.    In  certain  circumstances  non-resident  Australians,  who  can 
demonstrate overseas residency, may be eligible for a control permit. 

Where a craft is owned by a corporation and more than 50% of the owners of the corporation 
are Australian residents, a control permit will not be granted. 

Control  Permits  can  be  issued  for  specified  period,  for  example,  three  months  however  the 
maximum length a permit will be granted will not exceed twelve (12) months.  At the expiration 
of the control permit the holder may apply for an extension.  Providing the applicant still meets 
eligibility  requirements  an  extension  may  be  granted  however  extensions  will  only  be  granted 
for a maximum of three years within a four-year period.  The four-year period commences from 
the date of arrival of the smallcraft in Australia. 

When  a  control  permit  expires  and  an  extension  has  not  been  sought,  the  craft  must  either 
depart  Australia  or  be  formally  imported  and  an  import  declaration  lodged.  If  the  craft  is 
imported duty and tax will be payable. 

There  are  a  number  of  conditions  attached  to  the  granting  of  a  control  permit  and  if  a  permit 
holder is found to be in breach of any of the conditions, for example, action has been taken to 
sell the craft, Customs may take further action such as revoke the permit and require the craft to 
be formally imported.  In some circumstances a security may be requested. 

The trial will be conducted over a twelve-month period and will commence on 1 March 2008. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to Cargo Reporting Policy (Sea) on telephone 
number (02) 6275 8068 or fax number (02) 6275 5745.

Import and export controls for UN-sanctioned goods. 

On 24 March 2008, the Customs Regulations 1926 (the Customs Regulations), the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the Prohibited Imports Regulations) and the Customs 
(Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (the Prohibited Exports Regulations) were amended 
respectively by the Customs Amendment Regulations 2008 (No. 2), the Customs (Prohibited 
Imports) Amendment Regulations 2008 (No. 1) and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) 
Amendment Regulations 2008 (No. 1). 

The amending Regulations implement amendments made to the Customs Act 1901 (the 
Customs Act) by the International Trade Integrity Act 2007 (the Trade Integrity Act). 

The Trade Integrity Act amended the Customs Act, with effect from 24 March 2008, to introduce 
UN-sanctioned goods and new criminal offences for: 
• 
•  providing information that is false or misleading in an application for a permission to import 

importing or exporting UN-sanctioned goods without permission; and 

or export UN-sanctioned goods. 

UN-sanctioned Goods 
New section 233BABAA of the Customs Act provides that the regulations may prescribe certain 
goods as “UN-sanctioned goods”.  New regulation 179AAA of the Customs Regulations 
provides that the goods specified in Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 1AB to the Customs Regulations 
are UN-sanctioned goods. 

A.) Part 1 of Schedule 1AB to the Customs Regulations lists as UN-sanctioned goods the 
following goods to which the Prohibited Imports Regulations apply: 
• 
• 

rough diamonds being imported from Cote d'Ivoire (regulation 4N);

4Y); and 
certain goods being imported from Iran (regulation 4Z). 

• 

B.) Part 2 of Schedule 1AB to the Customs Regulations lists as UN-sanctioned goods the 
following goods to which the Prohibited Exports Regulations apply: 
•  paramilitary equipment being exported to Sierra Leone (regulation 13CH); 
•  arms or related materiel being exported to Afghanistan, Liberia, Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire and Lebanon (regulations 13CI, 13CK, 13CL, 13CM, 13CN 
and 13CP respectively); 

•  arms or related materiel and certain luxury goods being exported to the Democratic 

People's Republic of Korea (regulation 13CO); 

•  acetic anhydride being exported to Afghanistan (regulation 13CJ); 
• 

certain goods being exported to Iran (regulation 13CQ), being goods to which the Charter of 
the United Nations (Sanctions - Iran) Regulations 2008 apply; and 

•  goods listed on the defence and strategic goods list (regulation 13E) that are for, or are 

intended for, the immediate or final destination of Afghanistan, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic

Notices of Objection to Importation  
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of a 
trade mark to lodge a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs), objecting to the 
importation of goods which infringe their trade mark.  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force 
for a period of four years (effective 23 October 2006) from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of 
Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since January 2008 (ACN 2008/01).  Descriptions of the relevant 
trade marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current trade mark Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
www.customs.gov.au > media publications and forms> Customs notices > Intellectual Property – Notices of 
Objection > trade marks 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  This 
refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a 
description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  
Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any 
Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject to 
the control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs if: 
− 

they have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively 
similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  
are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

− 
unless it can be established that the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may 
not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has 
been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, 
where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark and the goods 
are imported into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an 
infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, 
as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical 
with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

Where a registered trade mark owner or an authorised user with a current Notice of Objection in place request 
additional trade marks to be added to their Notice, only the additional trade marks are included at the end of 
this ACN.  The inclusion of additional trade marks in the ACN is to ensure that ACN subscribers have all the 
appropriate up-to-date information. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of 
each State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of 
Objection, or Customs role in respect of those Notices, should contact the Customs Information and Support 
Centre on 1300 363 263 or the Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6245 5484.

Packing Materials & Packing Containers for Imported Goods 

This notice is intended to provide guidance on the classification of packing materials and packing 
containers used for transporting imported goods.  Adherence to the following classification principles 
should provide industry with a simpler process for the classification of certain goods, particularly in the 
clothing sector.  

Packing materials 

Packing materials used for international transport (including, in some cases, display for retail sale) will 
vary according to the type of goods imported.  The classification of such material is governed by 
Interpretative Rule 5(b) of Schedule 2 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Act).  This provides, in part, 
that: 

“… packing materials and packing containers presented with the goods therein shall be 
classified with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packing such goods. However, 
this provision is not binding when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly 
suitable for repetitive use.”   

Customs considers that certain ephemeral matter, such as labels, tags, cardboard inserts and other 
printed matter may be considered part of the packing of goods.  Where these, or other packing 
materials, are imported already incorporated as part of the packaging of the goods and are of a kind 
normally used in the packing of such goods, they should be classified with the goods. 

Packing material for clothing can include garments being imported on hangers.  However, where 
garments are imported already hanging upon a hanger, then Interpretative Rule 5(b) provides an 
exception for those hangers “clearly suitable for repetitive use”.  Discerning which hangers may fall 
within such a category is not a simple issue for either Customs or industry.  For this reason, Customs 
considers that hangers for the transport of goods in Chapters 60 to 63 may be classified separately.  
The choice of whether to classify hangers on garments separately will rest with the individual importer. 

Packing containers 

ACN 94/9 deals with re-usable packing containers in the form of coat hangers.  This allows those coat 
hangers suitable for re-use to be eligible for Item 34 of Schedule 4 of the Act, subject to security 
lodgement and to the hangers being exported within twelve months of the date of entry for home 
consumption.    

In reviewing the operation of this Notice, Customs notes that Item 34 has not been utilised for hangers 
for at least five years and that alternative arrangements for re-using certain coat hangers have been 
developed by industry.  In view of these circumstances, Customs has revoked the operation of  
ACN 94/9 with effect from the date of this notice. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to Manager, Tariff Review on telephone number  
(02) 6275 6434 or fax number (02) 6275 6471 or by email at tarrev2@customs.gov.au

Increase in customs and excise duty applicable to certain spirit 
based pre-mixed drinks 

The Government advised on 26 April 2008 that the excise equivalent component of the 
Customs duty applying to certain imported spirit based pre-mixed drinks (having an alcoholic 
strength by volume exceeding 1.15% but not exceeding 10%) would increase from $39.36 per 
litre of alcohol to $66.67 per litre of alcohol.  These drinks are commonly known as “alcopops” 
or “RTDs” (“ready to drink”). 

The increased duty rates were given effect through the publication of Customs Notice 
(No. 1) 2008 in Special Commonwealth Gazette S 88 of 26 April 2008.  The increased rates of 
duty took effect on and from 27 April 2008.  Equivalent changes were also made to the rate of 
excise payable on similar locally manufactured goods.  Excise Notice No. 1 (2008) published in 
Special Commonwealth Gazette S 87 refers. 

Below is a list of the tariff classifications in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff that are affected by 
this increase.  These rate increases also apply to the same goods listed in Schedule 5 (US 
originating goods) and Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods) of the Customs Tariff.

Notices of Objection to Importation  
Trade Marks Act 1995 

The Trade Marks Act 1995 allows the registered owner, or in certain circumstances, the authorised user of a 
trade mark to lodge a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs), objecting to the 
importation of goods which infringe their trade mark.  Unless revoked, a Notice of Objection remains in force 
for a period of four years (effective 23 October 2006) from the date of commencement.   

The attached Schedule sets out the registered owners and authorised users who have lodged Notices of 
Objection under the Trade Marks Act 1995 since April 2008 (ACN 2008/14).  Descriptions of the relevant trade 
marks are also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current trade mark Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
www.customs.gov.au > media publications and forms> Customs notices > Intellectual Property – Notices of 
Objection > trade marks 

For each particular trade mark described, the Schedule makes reference to a particular “class” of goods.  This 
refers to the classes of goods prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and along with a 
description of the goods, is used to describe the type of goods for which the particular trade mark is registered.  
Prospective importers of such goods should seek further advice from Customs regarding the ambit of any 
Notice of Objection set out in the Schedule. 

Goods referred to in this ACN, that are manufactured outside and imported into Australia, and are subject to 
the control of Customs under the meaning of the Customs Act 1901 are liable to be seized by Customs if: 
− 

they have applied to them, or in relation to them, a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively 
similar to, a trade mark listed in the attached Schedule; and  
are goods in respect of which the notified trade mark is registered; 

− 
unless it can be established that the goods do not infringe the relevant trade mark. 

Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 details the circumstances in which the use of a trade mark may, or may 
not, amount to an infringement.  For example, a trade mark is not infringed where the mark in question has 
been applied to, or in relation to, goods with the consent of the registered owner of the trade mark.  However, 
where the trade mark is applied by, or with the consent of, an overseas owner of the trade mark and the goods 
are imported into Australia without the consent of the Australian trade mark owner, this may still represent an 
infringement. 

People who are intending to import goods that potentially may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Trade Marks Act 1995 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, 
as to the implications of the trade marks legislation, and the meaning of terms such as ""substantially identical 
with"", ""deceptively similar to"" and ""an infringement of"" a trade mark.   

Where a registered trade mark owner or an authorised user with a current Notice of Objection in place request 
additional trade marks to be added to their Notice, only the additional trade marks are included at the end of 
this ACN.  The inclusion of additional trade marks in the ACN is to ensure that ACN subscribers have all the 
appropriate up-to-date information. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of 
each State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices of 
Objection, or Customs role in respect of those Notices, should contact the Customs Information and Support 
Centre on 1300 363 263 or the Intellectual Property Rights Group on (02) 6245 5484.

Notices of Objection to Importation 
Copyright Act 1968 

The Copyright Act 1968 allows the owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, to object to the 
importation of goods that infringe copyright.  The owner of the copyright, or the exclusive licensee, does this 
by lodging a Notice of Objection with the Australian Customs Service (Customs).  Unless revoked, a Notice 
of Objection remains in force for a period of four years from the date of commencement.    

The attached Schedule sets out the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, who have lodged a Notice of 
Objection under the Copyright Act 1968 since December 2007 (ACN 2007/64).  The Notices notify the 
objections of the copyright owners, and exclusive licensees, to the importation of goods that infringe their 
copyright. A description of where copyright is claimed is also set out in the Schedule. 

A detailed list of all current Copyright Notices of Objection is available on the Customs website at 
www.customs.gov.au > media publications and forms> Customs notices > Intellectual Property – Notices of 
Objection > copyright 

Goods identified by Customs at the border as potentially infringing copyright are liable to be seized by 
Customs unless it can be established that: 

- 
- 

the goods are being imported otherwise than for the purposes of trade (sale, lease, hire, etc); or 
the goods do not infringe the copyright. 

People who have been intending to import goods that may be liable to seizure under the provisions of the 
Copyright Act 1968 should consider seeking advice from Customs, or a suitably qualified legal practitioner, 
as to the implications of the copyright legislation. 

Copies of the relevant Notices of Objection have been forwarded to the Customs office in the capital city of 
each State and Territory.  Importers, or their advisers, who require further information regarding the Notices 
of Objection, or Customs’ role in respect of those Notices, should contact the Customs Information and

Changes to the Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme 

Customs Determination of 27 June 2008 sets out cheese and curd quota allocations for the 

period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009.  This Determination is different from previous years' cheese 

and curd Determinations as it includes an extra condition to more clearly reflect the policy on 

the use of cheese and curd quotas.  

The purpose of this extra condition is to make clear that quota allocated in a particular financial 

year is only available to be utilized within that financial year. Unused allocation at the end of the 

financial year will not be carried over to a subsequent financial year or remain available to be 

used after the end of the financial year in which the allocation was made.  Any allocations unused 

by quota holders during a financial year will be cancelled at the end of that financial year.   

The Determination requires that the concessional rate of duty applicable to the cheese and curd 

quota be claimed at the time the cheese and curd is entered for home consumption.  The 

treatment code that identifies the cheese and curd quota must be included in the entry for home 

consumption of the eligible goods at the time such goods are entered for home consumption.  

Holders of cheese and curd quota under the scheme should use treatment code 462 to enter 

the eligible goods at the concessional rate. Quota holders will not be able to claim the 

concessional rate of duty for the imported goods through a refund if they do not include the 

relevant treatment code in the entry for home consumption of the goods.   

The changes outlined above will only apply to cheese and curd entered for home consumption 

on or after 1 July 2008. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to Supervisor, Tariff Concessions on telephone 

number (02) 6275 6483 or fax number (02) 6275 6376.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2008-29.pdf,Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco Content) Act 2008,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2008/29 

Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco Content) Act 2008 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco Content) Act 2008 amends the Customs Tariff Act 
1995 (the Customs Tariff) to clarify the existing references to 'tobacco content' found within the 
Customs Tariff. The amendment confirms that the customs duty payable on loose tobacco 
products classified in Chapter 24 of the Customs Tariff is based on the total weight of the 
goods. 

The customs duty rate for imported loose tobacco products (including bulk, pouch and tinned 
tobacco), classified in Chapter 24 of the Customs Tariff, is based on a dollar per kilogram rate of 
“tobacco content”. In practice, Customs calculate duty liability for loose tobacco based on the 
total weight of the loose tobacco, including moisture content and other additives. However, in 
respect of molasses tobacco products, Customs has previously made an administrative 
exception, assessing the duty liability on the tobacco leaf content.  

The amendment to the Customs Tariff inserts a definition of ‘tobacco content’ to include ‘any 
thing (including moisture) added to the tobacco leaf during manufacturing or processing’. The 
definition applies to the calculation of the customs duty payable on molasses tobacco products.   

The amendment commenced on 24 June 2008 and applies to goods imported into Australia on 
or after 1 November 1999, and also to goods that were imported before that date but on which 
the time for working out the rate of import duty on those goods had not occurred before that 
date. For example, goods that were warehoused on importation before 1 November 1999 and 
not entered into home consumption until on or after 1 November 1999. 

Application of amendment to molasses tobacco products 

In recognition of the administrative exception Customs has previously made in relation to 
molasses tobacco products, Customs will apply the amendment to molasses tobacco products 
entered for home consumption from 24 June 2008. This means that from 24 June 2008 the 
amount of duty payable on molasses tobacco products will be calculated on the total weight of 
the tobacco product as opposed to the tobacco leaf content.  

Customs will also allow a reasonable period of time where no action will be taken under the 
Infringement Notice Scheme (INS) for non-compliance. After that period has expired, normal 
compliance management actions will apply.   

From 24 June 2008 – 24 September 2008 a record of non-compliance will not be made and no 
action will be taken under the Infringement Notice Scheme (INS) if the amount identified in the 
quantity field of a statement is based on the tobacco leaf content as opposed to the total weight 
of the molasses tobacco product.  

However, it is expected that declarations lodged during this period will be reviewed by the 
owner of the goods or the owner’s agent and that any errors will be corrected and any customs 
duty owing will be paid. 

After the end of this period any false or misleading statements made to Customs, including any 
statements made in the period 24 June 2008 – 24 September 2008 that have not been 
corrected to take account of the definition of tobacco content, may be subject to action under 
the INS in accordance with the Infringement Notice Scheme Guidelines.

Increase to the Luxury Car Tax Threshold 

This notice is to advise of the recent increase in the Luxury Car Tax (LCT) threshold.  The 
Australian Taxation Office has advised in LCT Determination 2008/01 that, as of 1 July 2008, 
the Luxury Car Tax threshold has increased to $57,180 for the 2008-09 financial year.    

Any motor vehicle defined as a ‘luxury car’ in A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 
with a value above $57,180 is subject to luxury car tax on the portion of its value that exceeds 
the threshold. The LCT is imposed on luxury cars at the retail level and is calculated in addition 
to any GST that may be payable. 

All related information within the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) has been updated to reflect the 
new threshold.  For processing within the ICS, in cases where the LCT value exceeds the LCT 
threshold: 

•  each entry line must have one car only; and 
•  each entry line must be dealt with in one of the following ways:  

- 
-

Changes to Tariff Advice and Tariff Concession Order 
Applications 

Tariff Advice Applications 

In response to an increased demand for Tariff Advices, Customs will be screening all 
future Tariff Advice applications to ensure that supporting evidence is supplied.  This is 
expected to assist Customs’ capacity to meet service standards. 

From Monday 21 July 2008, Customs will expect all Tariff Advice applications to at least 
meet a minimum standard of supplied information.  Details of the information required are 
provided at Customs website (www.customs.gov.au) under “Guidelines for Lodgement of 
Tariff Advices”.  The information requirements for future Tariff Advice applications may be 
summarised as follows: 

•  detailed identification and description of the goods to be imported; 

•  detailed reasons for the claimed heading and subheading (as well as for the tariff 

headings considered and rejected); and 

• 

Illustrative Descriptive Material (IDM), other supporting evidence and/or sample 
(as appropriate) to be provided to Customs when lodging a manual application or 
within five days of entering the electronic Tariff Advice application. 

Customs will not process a Tariff Advice application that does not include clear and legible 
IDM, other supporting evidence and/or a sample as required.   

Where a Tariff Advice application is accepted but further information is requested by 
Customs, applicants will have 14 days to respond with the requested material.  Failure to 
respond at all within this period will mean the application is rejected.  Customs will 
consider an extension of the 14 day period, on a case-by-case basis, where a response 
has been received but the applicant requires more time to provide the information. 

Tariff Concession Order (TCO) Applications 

As a result of a similar increase in the number of applications for Tariff Concession Orders, 
Customs will require more information about the goods to be covered in future TCO 
applications as well as improved compliance in certain other aspects.   

Customs has accommodated deficient TCO applications in recent years by accepting the 
application at the screening period and then spending much effort and time pursuing more 
information from the applicants.  Although this meant there were few rejections of 
applications, it has also affected Customs ability to process all applications efficiently and 
effectively.

Change of Tariff Classification Practice and ACN 2008/18 

This ACN clarifies the provisions that apply when an advised change of administrative 
practice occurs in regard to the classification of particular goods.   

Where  such  a  change  of  practice  occurs,  Customs  will  not  apply  the  new  practice 
retrospectively.   

Where the change results in a higher rate of duty applying to particular goods, Customs 
will not seek to recover further duties for  

•  goods imported prior to advice of the change of practice; or  

•  on goods in transit at the time of the advised change  

provided  that  such  goods  were  entered  in  accordance  with  the  advised  practice 
applicable prior to the change. 

Where  the  change  of  practice  results  in  a  lower  rate  of  duty  applying  to  particular 
goods, section 166  of  the  Customs  Act  1901  applies.    Accordingly,  there  will  be  no 
entitlement (as a result of the change to practice) to refunds of any duty paid before the 
alteration of the practice. 

ACN 2008/18 provided guidance on a change of administrative practice in regard to the 
tariff  classification  treatment  of  various  packing  materials  and  packing  containers.  
ACN 2008/18  was  signed  on  26  May  2008 and  has  a  date  of  effect of  Friday 6  June

Special Safeguards on Canned Pineapple from Thailand 

By Notice published in the Commonwealth Gazette on 16 July 2008, and registered on 
the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries 
and Forestry has imposed special safeguards on imports of canned pineapple from 
Thailand. The provisions derived from Article 509 of the Thailand – Australia Free 
Trade Agreement relate to canned pineapple classified under tariff subheading 
2008.20.00 (Statistical codes 26 and 27).   

The effect of the provisions is that instead of being free of duty, all canned pineapple 
imported from Thailand will attract the general rate of duty of 5% from 16 July 2008 
until 31 December 2008 (Preference Scheme ‘GEN’ in ICS), unless ‘in-transit’ 
provisions apply (Preference Scheme ‘THSS’ in ICS).  Please also refer to ACN 2005/27 
for more information on claiming preferential rates of duty in the ICS. 

To qualify for ‘in-transit’ provisions, the goods must meet the requirements of being 
Thai originating, have a valid Thai Certificate of Origin at time of importation, and be 
exported from Thailand on or before 16 July 2008, under a contract entered into on or 
before 16 July 2008. 

The safeguards will cease to apply to goods imported on or after 1 January 2009. 

Please note that special safeguards have not been imposed on imports of non-canned 
pineapple classified under tariff subheading 2008.20.00 (Statistical code 28). 
Preference Scheme ‘TH’ in ICS is to be used to receive the preferential duty rate for 
these goods.

Amendments to the Customs Act 1901 – Customs brokers  

The Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) has been amended to update the brokers licensing 
provisions to recognise the changing nature of employment in the broker community.  These 
amendments are included in the Customs Legislation Amendment (Modernising) Act 2008 and 
commenced on 13 July 2008.  

The amendments repeal the conditions in section 183CD of the Customs Act that a nominee of 
a customs broker: 

• 
• 

cannot be the nominee of another customs broker (paragraph 183CD(1)(f)); and  
cannot be a customs broker at a place other than a place where the first-mentioned 
customs broker is a customs broker (paragraph 183CD(1)(j)).  

The repeal of these conditions means that a freelance or locum customs broker may be a 
nominee of more than one corporate customs broker at any one time. 

The amendments to the broker licensing provisions do not change the responsibility 
of a corporate customs broker to: 

•  always have at least one nominee broker associated with the brokerage; and 

•  advise Customs in writing within 30 days of any change in circumstances including (but 

not limited to) changes in the nominees employed by the brokerage (either 
commencing or ceasing). Customs must also be advised by the nominee, in writing, of 
the commencement of employment with a corporate customs brokerage. 

The lodgement of import or warehouse declarations in the Integrated Cargo System 
(ICS) by a nominee of a corporate customs broker is subject to a check that the 
nominee is recorded as being employed by the corporate brokerage.  Failure to 
advise Customs of any changes in the nominees employed by the corporate 
customs broker will result in the nominee being unable to lodge the declaration. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to Broker Licensing on telephone number 
(02) 6275 5088 or fax number (02) 6275 6601.

Indexation of certain customs and excise tariff duty rates – August 2008 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June Quarter 2008 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 23 July 2008.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921, 
the rates of customs and excise duties on certain spirits, beer and tobacco will increase on 
1 August 2008.  The new rates are set out in tables 1 to 4 of this Notice.   

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, ie the June Quarter 2008 number, by the previous highest December 
or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the June 2008 index 
number (164.6) has been divided by the December 2007 index number (160.1) to establish an 
indexation factor of 1.028.  As this factor is more than one, rates of customs and excise duty 
have been increased by the application of this factor.

Amendments to the Customs Act 1901  
Duty Recovery and Payment Under Protest 

This ACN supersedes ACN 2003/60. 

The Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) has been amended to modernise provisions relating to 
customs duty recovery and payments under protest and to allow refunds to be applied against 
unpaid duty in some circumstances.  These amendments are included in the Customs 
Legislation Amendment (Modernising) Act 2008 (Modernising Act).  A copy of this Act is 
available at www.comlaw.gov.au. The amendments commence on 9 August 2008.  

Duty recovery 
Previously, duty recovery provisions were detailed in sections 153 and 165 of the Customs Act.     
The Modernising Act repeals sections 153 and 165 and replaces those provisions with a new 
section 165.  In addition, the Modernising Act formalises the policy previously advised in ACN 
2003/60. 

The new section 165 provides that: 

1)  An amount of duty that is due and payable in respect of goods, is a debt due to the 

Commonwealth and is payable by the owner of the goods; 

2)  An amount of a drawback, refund or rebate of duty that is overpaid to a person is a debt 

due to the Commonwealth and is payable by the person. 

Demand for duty 
Under new section 165, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) may make a written demand for the 
payment of an amount of duty that is a debt due to the Commonwealth.  The demand must 
specify the amount of the duty or overpayment being demanded and must include an 
explanation of how the amount has been calculated. 

Time limit for recovery of duty 
New section 165 limits the time for recovery of customs duty to four years, except in the case of 
fraud or evasion where no time limit will apply.  The time limits outlined below apply only  
to situations that do not involve fraud or evasion.  

For an amount of duty that is due and payable in respect of goods, a demand must be made 
within four years of the date the amount was to be paid under the Customs Act. 

For example, in the case of goods entered for home consumption under section 71A of the 
Customs Act, duty is payable at the time of the entry of goods for home consumption (section 
132AA of the Customs Act).  Therefore, in this situation, a demand must be made within four 
years of the date of entry for home consumption. 

For an amount of a drawback, refund or rebate of duty that is overpaid to a person, a demand 
must be made within four years of the date the amount was paid. 

New section 165 brings the recovery of customs duty in line with the recovery of GST and other 
indirect taxes under the Taxation Administration Act 1953.

Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has imposed special safeguards on imports of 
prepared or preserved tuna from Thailand.  The provisions derived from Article 509 of

(Sarda spp.) which are classified under tariff subheading 1604.14.00.   

The effect of the provisions is that instead of being free of duty, all prepared or

Australia from Thailand from 11 September 2008 until 31 December 2008 will attract 
the general rate of duty, even if the goods are not entered for home consumption until

provisions apply (Preference Scheme ‘THSS’ in ICS).  Please also refer to ACN 
2005/27 for more information on claiming preferential rates of duty in the ICS. 

Importation occurs when goods are landed in Australia, or brought within a port for the 
purpose of landing them in Australia, or when the carriage of the goods arriving from 
overseas is ended or its continuity is in some way broken. 

To qualify for ‘in-transit’ provisions, the goods must meet the requirements of being 
Thai originating, have a valid Thai Certificate of Origin at time of importation, and be

Revocation of Gift Concession 

Under Item 32B of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 there are several by-laws that provide 
duty and tax free import concessions.  One of these by-laws (number 9740019 of 17 September 1997) 
is commonly known as the ‘gift concession’.  It applies to unsolicited gifts of a non-recurring nature as 
follows: 

……..sent to an individual in Australia by or on behalf of an individual outside Australia, being 
goods, or part thereof, to a maximum value of $200 per consignment.  For the purposes of this 
by-law, ""goods"" does not include:  

(a) tobacco products, as follows;  

(i) in excess of 250 cigarettes; OR  
(ii) in excess of 250 grams of cigars or tobacco products, other than  
    cigarettes;  

(b) alcoholic liquor in excess of 1 litre;  
(c) goods imported by a passenger arriving in Australia from overseas;  
(d) goods imported by a member of the crew of a ship or aircraft arriving from  
     overseas; OR  
(e) goods forming part of a bulk order placed on the overseas supplier.  

Since October 2005, usage of the gift concession has significantly decreased following the 
introduction of a uniform duty and tax free threshold for all imported goods (except for alcoholic 
beverages and tobacco products) up to a value of $1,000.   

The gift concession also highlights an inconsistency in the tax treatment of imported alcoholic 
beverages and tobacco products.  While such products are excluded from import concessions under 
the uniform import threshold for goods, they remain eligible for duty and tax exemptions under the gift 
concession.   

To remove this inconsistency, Customs will be revoking the gift concession (by-law number 9740019) 
on and from 1 October 2008. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to Manager, Schedule 4 Concessions on telephone 
number (02) 6275 6542 or fax number (02) 6275 6471.

Special Safeguards on Prepared or Preserved Tuna from Thailand 

This Australian Customs Notice replaces Australian Customs Notice No. 2008/42 dated 
10 September 2008.  

By Notice published in the Commonwealth Gazette on 10 September 2008, and 
registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments, the Minister for 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has imposed special safeguards on imports of 
prepared or preserved tuna from Thailand.  The provisions derived from Article 509 of 
the Thailand – Australia Free Trade Agreement relate to tuna, skipjack and bonito 
(Sarda spp.) which are classified under tariff subheading 1604.14.00.   

The effect of the provisions is that instead of being free of duty, all prepared or 
preserved tuna, skipjack and bonito (HS classification 1604.14.00) imported into 
Australia from Thailand from 11 September 2008 until 31 December 2008 will attract 
the general rate of duty, even if the goods are not entered for home consumption until 
after 31 December 2008 (Preference Scheme ‘GEN’ in ICS), unless ‘in-transit’ 
provisions apply (Preference Scheme ‘THSS’ in ICS).  Please also refer to ACN 
2005/27 for more information on claiming preferential rates of duty in the ICS. 

Importation occurs when goods are landed in Australia, or brought within a port for the 
purpose of landing them in Australia, or when the carriage of the goods arriving from 
overseas is ended or its continuity is in some way broken. 

To qualify for ‘in-transit’ provisions, the goods must meet the requirements of being 
Thai originating, have a valid Thai Certificate of Origin at time of importation, and be 
exported from Thailand on or before 10 September 2008, under a contract entered into 
on or before 10 September 2008. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to origin@customs.gov.au, or to the 
Valuation and Origin Section on telephone number (02) 6275 6556, or fax number 
(02) 6275 6477.

Customs Broker Licensing – Approved Courses of Study 

This Australian Customs Notice is to provide potential applicants for a customs broker licence 
with information regarding the approved courses of study.  

Background 

Applications for a broker’s licence must be made in accordance with the requirements of the 
Customs Act 1901 (the Act). Among other things, the Act requires that the Chief Executive 
Officer of Customs (the CEO) grant a broker’s licence only if, in his opinion, the applicant is 
qualified to be a customs broker. A qualified customs broker must:  

(1) unless exempted by the CEO, have complete an approved course of study or instruction; and  
(2) have the acquired experience that fits the applicant to be a customs broker.  

Current Approved Course  

For the purposes of section 183CC of the Act, certain specified units from the now superseded 
Transport and Distribution Training Package provided by Registered Training Organisations 
(RTO’s) have formed the approved course of study for a broker’s licence since 2006. 
Completion of these units is recognised as completion of the ‘approved course of study’. The 
specified units, referred to as the existing course, are:  

TDTA997C    Complete and Check Import-Export Documentation 

TDTA4804A  Carry out Border Clearance Functions 

TDTA4904A  Implement Specialist Permit Requirements as Part of Customs Broking 

Activities 

TDTA5004A  Implement GST Regulations as Part of Customs Broking Activities 

TDTA5104A  Carry Out Non-Commodity Quarantine Procedures  

TDTA5204A  Carry Out Customs Clearance Practices 

TDTA5304A  Carry Out Customs Valuation  

TDTA5404A  Classify Commodities for the Import and Export of Goods Through Customs 

TDTA5504A  Classify Complex Commodities for the Import and Export of Goods Through 

Customs 

TDTA5604A  Carry Out Complex Valuation 

TDTA5704A  Analyse, advise and Carry Out Integrated Border Clearance Transactions 

Registered Training Organisations will no longer be offering enrolment in the above units to 
new students and will cease to offer these units to existing students after October 2010.  

New Approved Course  

As a result of the standard review of the previous Training Package by the Department of 
Education, Science and Training (DEST), units that form the approved course have now been 
re-named as part of that Training Package review. The content of the newly named units has 
remained effectively the same and the quantum of units comprising the approved course 
(eleven) is unchanged.  As a result of those changes the CEO of Customs has now also 
approved the following competencies as a course of study for a broker’s licence:

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2008-50.pdf,Increase to the Luxury Car Tax rate,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2008/50 

Increase to the Luxury Car Tax Rate 

This notice is to advise of Customs’ implementation of the Government’s 2008–09 Budget 
increase to the Luxury Car Tax (LCT) rate as it applies to imported vehicles.  This means that 
the luxury car tax rate will increase from 25 per cent to 33 per cent for certain vehicles valued 
over the luxury car tax threshold ($57,180 for the 2008–09 year). 

The increased rate will be applied retrospectively to importations from 1 July 2008. 

Legislation to increase the LCT rate from 1 July 2008 came into force on 3 October 2008, and 
includes an exemption from LCT payment for certain fuel efficient cars under the fuel efficient 
car limit ($75,000 for the 2008–09 year). While exemptions may be claimed immediately 
through the Customs Integrated Cargo System (ICS), Customs will issue a separate ACN 
regarding the arrangements for fuel efficient cars. 

Definition of Luxury Vehicle 

Any motor vehicle defined as a ‘luxury car’ in A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 
with a value above $57,180 is subject to LCT on the portion of the value that exceeds the 
$57,180 threshold.  

Importers of motor vehicles that were subject to the increased LCT at the time of importation on 
or after 1 July 2008 will be required to pay the differential amount.  Importers should make 
arrangements to pay additional LCT to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).   

Further information regarding payment of additional LCT is available on the ATO website 
www.ato.gov.au or by contacting the ATO on 13 28 66.  

Import Entry requirements 

All related information within the ICS has been updated to give effect to the increased LCT rate.  
Where the value of vehicle exceeds the LCT threshold, the following applies: 
•  each entry line must have one motor vehicle only; and 
•  each entry line must be dealt with in one of the following ways:  

- 
- 
- 

by quoting the importer’s valid Australian Business Number (ABN); or 
using a valid exemption code; or 
paying the LCT. 

Deferred Payment Arrangements 

Importers who quote their ABN and defer payment of LCT at the time of importation will need to 
make arrangements with the ATO to report and/or pay any increased LCT liability incurred from 
1 July 2008. 

Exemption 

Importers who have claimed and received an exemption from LCT are excluded from these 
provisions.

Amendments to Luxury Car Tax Legislation – Fuel Efficient Luxury Cars 

As notified in Australian Customs Notice 2008/50, from 1 July 2008 the rate of luxury car tax 
(LCT) increased from 25 per cent to 33 per cent for cars valued over the LCT threshold 
($57,180 for the 2008–09 year). The legislation to increase the rate of LCT also makes available 
some new concessions including an exemption from LCT for certain fuel efficient luxury cars.  
Fuel efficient luxury cars with a customs value under the fuel efficient car threshold ($75,000 for 
the 2008–09 year) are exempt from LCT.  The amendment regarding the LCT exemption for 
fuel efficient luxury cars commenced on 3 October 2008. 

This notice is to outline arrangements for importers of fuel efficient luxury cars that are exempt 
from LCT at the time of importation on or after 3 October 2008. 

Fuel Efficient Luxury Cars 

For luxury car tax purposes, fuel efficient luxury cars are cars that have a fuel consumption of 
7 litres per 100 kilometres or less. LCT does not apply to fuel efficient cars under $75,000 for 
the 2008-09 financial year. 

Further information regarding Fuel Efficient Luxury Cars is available on the ATO website 
www.ato.gov.au or by contacting the ATO on 13 28 66.  

An exemption code “FEV” is available in the Customs Integrated Cargo System (ICS) to enable 
importers of fuel efficient luxury cars to claim the luxury car tax exemption when an import 
declaration is lodged. 

Import Declaration requirements 

All related information within the ICS is now updated to allow the use of the exemption from LCT 
for fuel efficient luxury cars below the fuel efficient luxury car threshold of $75,000 for 2008-09 
year.   

Where the value of a car exceeds the LCT threshold, the following applies: 

•  each line on the declaration must have one motor car only; and 
•  each line on the declaration must be dealt with in one of the following ways:  

(cid:57)  by quoting the importer’s valid Australian Business Number (ABN) and setting the LCT 

quote indicator to “yes”; or 
(cid:57)  using a valid exemption code; or 
(cid:57)  paying the LCT. 

The exemption code “FEV” may only be used if the customs value for that declaration line is 
below the fuel efficient luxury car threshold.

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 
1956 - repeal of the import control on electric dog collars 

On 1 December 2008, a regulation repealing the import control on certain electric dog collars 
under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1956 was registered on the 
Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. The regulation takes effect from 2 December 2008. 

Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 2008 (No. 5), repeals the import control 
under Item 10(a) of Schedule 2 of the Regulations on dog collars incorporating apparatus 
designed to cause an electric shock. Consequently, an import permission is no longer required 
for these collars. 

The change relates only to the importation of these goods.  Some State and Territory authorities 
have their own requirements relating to the possession and use of this type of dog collar.  It is 
the importer’s responsibility to make whatever enquiries are necessary to determine what, if 
any, requirements may apply in this regard. 

The import control in relation to dog collars incorporating protrusions designed to bruise or 
puncture an animal’s skin, formerly Item 10(b), is retained as Item 10 of Schedule 2 of the 
amended regulations. 

Inquiries  concerning  this  notice  may  be  directed  to  the  Manager,  Environment  and  Wildlife, 
Community Protection on telephone number (02) 6275 6047 or fax number (02) 6229 3840.

Change to the import control on “mosquito zappers” 

The application of the import control on hand-held electric devices designed to administer an 
electric shock on contact is being changed, as it relates to hand-held insect electrocutors. 
These devices, commonly known as “mosquito zappers”, are controlled within Item 12 of 
Schedule 2 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. 

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the ACCC), the policy agency that 
provides advice to Customs on this control, has advised that it is prepared to support the 
availability of certain types of the device in the market place. 

The ACCC has made this decision based on the view that, provided the devices meet certain 
standards, they pose a negligible risk to human safety in normal operating conditions. 

Based on the ACCC’s decision, Customs has determined that mosquito zappers may now be 
imported without a permit if they are powered by a storage battery capacity not exceeding 
6 volts, and the electrified grid is shielded in such a way as to prevent contact with the live 
component. 

The revised control can be accommodated without amending existing legislation. Consequently, 
it takes effect immediately. 

The ACCC remains concerned about the potential risks these devices pose if the voltage 
capacity of the storage batteries increases above the levels currently seen in the devices.  In 
particular, the ACCC would not support the availability of devices with a storage battery capacity 
exceeding 6 volts. 

Neither the ACCC or Customs is aware of any devices currently available with a storage battery 
capacity exceeding 6 volts.  However, if such devices were to become available, consideration 
would be given to a regulation amendment specifically designed to address the ACCC’s 
concerns. 

Inquiries  concerning  this  notice  may  be  directed  to  the  Manager,  Environment  and  Wildlife, 
Community Protection on telephone number (02) 6275 6047 or fax number (02) 6229 3840.

Introduction of the Post Import Permission Scheme 

On 12 July 2008, the Customs Amendment (Strengthening Border Controls) Bill 2008 received 
Royal Assent. The amendments to the Act introduced a number of changes, including the 
establishment of a post import permission scheme: see Subdivision GC of Division I of Part XII 
of the Act. This scheme allows a permission to be granted after importation in respect of certain 
classes of goods, as specified in the PI Regulations, so long as the goods were not concealed 
when imported. The Customs Regulations 1926 were amended to include a list of goods that 
are subject to the new post import permission scheme: Regulation 170AA applies. 

Upon identification of imported goods eligible for inclusion in the post import permission 
scheme, Customs will detain the goods for 30 days, or other prescribed period, while the 
importer/owner seeks appropriate import permission. Within this period, the importer will be 
required to provide to Customs written evidence that s/he has sought permission to import the 
goods. If that does not occur, then Customs will seize the goods in accordance with the Act.  

If permission to import the goods is refused, then Customs will seize the goods in accordance 
with the Act. If permission is granted, then it will be deemed that the permission was granted 
prior to the import and Customs will release the goods.  

The post import permission option is available regardless of whether the goods were imported 
by sea, air, post or passengers. It only applies to certain controlled items and it does not 
weaken the border controls on prohibited items. Importantly, the post import permission scheme 
does not replace the existing requirement to obtain import permission from the relevant permit 
issuing authority prior to importation; rather, it allows flexibility to Customs in dealing with 
importers who genuinely were not aware, or were unable to obtain import permission prior to 
importation. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to community.protection@customs.gov.au or 
to  the  Manager,  Community  Protection  Section  on  telephone  number  (02)  6275  5963  or  fax 
number (02) 6229 3840.

Indexation of certain customs and excise tariff duty rates – February 2009 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December Quarter 2008 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 28 January 2009.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921, 
the rates of customs and excise duties on certain spirits, beer and tobacco will increase on  
2 February 2009.  The new rates are set out in tables 1 to 4 of this Notice.   

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, ie the December Quarter 2008 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
December 2008 index number (166.0) has been divided by the June 2008 index number 
(164.6) to establish an indexation factor of 1.009.  As this factor is more than one, rates of 
customs and excise duty have been increased by the application of this factor.

Customs Requirements for Cargo Outturn Reporting by Air Cargo 
Terminal Operators (CTOs) and Air and Sea Depot Operators 

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice (ACN) is to explain the obligations of air 
CTOs and air and sea depot operators to communicate an outturn report in respect of 
cargo. 

When is an outturn report required to be communicated? 

The obligation to communicate an outturn report is set out in section 64ABAA of the 
Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act). 

An outturn report is required to be lodged to Customs by a CTO operator when cargo is 
unloaded from an aircraft.  Outturn reports are also required to be communicated by the 
person in charge of a Customs place (other than a warehouse) receiving cargo that is 
moved under a permission given under section 71E (underbond movement). 

An outturn report must be lodged in accordance with the following timeframes: 

•  When cargo is unloaded from an aircraft, an outturn report must be communicated 

• 

• 

• 

within 24 hours of the aircraft’s arrival (or other period as prescribed by the 
regulations); 
If containerised cargo is received at a depot but not unpacked at that depot, an 
outturn report must be provided within 24 hours after the person in charge of the 
depot records receipt of the container (or other period as prescribed by the 
regulations); 
If containerised cargo is received at a depot and is unpacked at that depot, the 
operator of the depot is required to provide Customs with an outturn report within 24 
hours after the container has been unpacked (or other period as prescribed by the 
regulations); and 
If the cargo is not in a container, an outturn report must be provided to Customs the 
day after the day on which the person in charge of that place recorded a receipt of 
the cargo at that place (or other period as prescribed by the regulations).  Note: 
“Day” does not include Sundays or public holidays.

Australia–Chile Free Trade Agreement – Rules of Origin 

Goods that originate in Chile will be entitled to preferential rates of customs duty when the 
Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement (ACl-FTA) enters into force on the 06 March 2009. 

The purpose of this Australian Customs Notice (ACN) is to summarise the rules for determining 
whether a good originates in Chile. 

Legislation 

Preferential rates of customs duty 

The Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff), as amended by the Customs Tariff Amendment 
(Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Act 2008, will provide preferential rates 
of customs duty for goods that are Chilean originating goods. 

The preferential rates of customs duty will apply to Chilean originating goods that are imported 
on or after the day that ACl-FTA enters into force, or goods imported before that day and 
entered for home consumption on or after that day. 

Detailed information on the preferential rates of customs duty to apply to Chilean originating 
goods will be the subject of a separate ACN. 

Other duties and taxes 

While Chilean originating goods will be eligible for preferential rates of duty, excise-equivalent 
duties, goods and services tax, dumping duties and other taxes and levies, including cost 
recovery charges, if relevant, will still be payable in relation to such goods. 

Rules of origin 

Goods will be Chilean originating goods if they satisfy the requirements of: 

• 

• 

Division 1F of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act), as inserted by Part 1 of 
Schedule 1 of the Customs Amendment (Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation) Act 2008; and 

the Customs (Chilean Rules of Origin) Regulations 2008 (the ACl-FTA Regulations). 

There are rules of origin for the following categories of goods: 

• 

• 

• 

goods that are wholly obtained in Chile; 

goods that are produced in Chile, exclusively from originating materials; and 

goods produced in Chile or in Chile and Australia from non-originating materials, or a 
combination of non-originating and originating materials.

Australia–Chile Free Trade Agreement – Customs Tariff 
Amendments 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation) 
Act 2008 (the Act) received Royal Assent on 27 November 2008, as Act No. 128 of 2008.  The 
Act contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff) to implement the duty 
reductions contained in the Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement (ACl-FTA) by: 

• 

• 

• 

providing Free and preferential rates of customs duty for goods that are Chilean 
originating goods in accordance with new Division 1F of Part VIII of the Customs 
Act 1901; 

phasing the preferential rates of customs duty for certain goods to Free by 2015; and 

creating a new Schedule 7 in the Tariff to accommodate the preferential and phasing 
rates of duty. 

The amendments to the Tariff contained in the Act provide that a Free rate of duty applies to 
Chilean originating goods, unless a rate is specified in new Schedule 7 opposite the tariff 
classification that applies to those goods. 

Reference should be made to ACN No. 2009/11, which sets out the rules for determining 
whether goods are Chilean originating goods, for the purposes of the Tariff. 

The amendments relating to the ACl-FTA will come into effect on 6 March 2009.  The Act also 
provides that the rates for Chilean originating goods will apply to goods imported into Australia 
before 6 March 2009, where the time for working out the rate of import duty on the goods had 
not occurred before that date. 

Alterations contained in Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2009 – certain 
alcohol and tobacco products 

Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2009, tabled in the Parliament on 25 February 2009, contains 
alterations to the rates of duty, specified in Schedule 7, for certain alcohol and tobacco products 
that are Chilean originating goods.  These alterations reflect increases in the rates of excise 
equivalent customs duty that took effect on 2 February 2009, following the release of the 
December 2008 CPI figures. 

The above Tariff Proposal also contains alterations to the rates of duty for those items in 
Schedule 7 that are applicable to ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages.  These rates reflect the 
rates of excise equivalent customs duty specified for those goods in the Customs Tariff 
Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009, tabled in the Parliament on 11 February 2009. 

The above alterations will ensure that excise equivalent rates of customs duty imposed on 
alcohol and tobacco products, when imported as Chilean originating goods under the

Amendment to Item 15 By-laws 

On 1 April 2009, item 15 of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff) By-
law No. 0540001 and 0540002 will be superseded by By-law No. 0906049 (for the passenger 
concession) and By-law No. 0906051 (for unaccompanied personal effects) following the 
Australian Human Rights Commission's report ""Same-Sex:  Same Entitlements"". All 
Commonwealth legislation is progressively being amended to remove discrimination, to enable 
same-sex couples and their children to be recognised by Commonwealth law.   

The definition of ""family"" in the fore-mentioned by-laws did not include same-sex couples and 
their children, with the result that such couples and children could not access the concessions 
granted by item 15 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff.  The laws will be amended to reflect a 
broader definition of family. 

This extends the previous definitions in By-law No. 0540001 and 0540002 to a person and his 
or her de facto partner (within the meaning of section 22A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901), 
and any of their children who are under the age of 18 years.  Under the definition of de facto 
partner in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, a person can be a de facto partner of another person 
if they are of the same sex as the other person.  Therefore, an eligible same-sex couple and 
any of their children under 18 years will be able to access the concession granted under item 15 
from 1 April 2009. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to (Manager, Cargo Clearance) on telephone

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2009-16.pdf,Singapore Australia Free Trade Agreement – changes to Certificate of Origin requirements,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2009/16 

Singapore Australia Free Trade Agreement –  
changes to Certificate of Origin requirements 

The  Singapore-Australia  Free  Trade  Agreement  (SAFTA)  entered  into  force  for  Australia  on 
28 July  2003.    The  SAFTA  provided  for  Ministerial  reviews  of  the  SAFTA  to  allow  for  the 
SAFTA to be amended ensuring that the SAFTA remains relevant and able to offer additional 
benefits to business. 

At the Ministerial Review of the SAFTA, the parties agreed to amendments to Articles 11 and 
12  of  Chapter  3  of  the  SAFTA  to  incorporate  changes  to  Certificates  of  Origin  (CoO)  and 
Declaration requirements.   

Under the SAFTA, an importer of goods from Singapore into Australia requires a CoO (issued 
by  the  Government  of  Singapore)  and  a  Declaration  (made  by  the  Singaporean  exporter)  in 
order to claim a preferential rate of duty for the goods under the SAFTA.   

Under  previous  Articles  11  and  12  of  Chapter  3  of  the  SAFTA,  a  CoO  could  be  used  for 
multiple  shipments  of  goods  to  which  that  Certificate  relates  within  two  years  of  its  issue, 
provided  that  the  first  shipment  occurred  within  the  first  year  of  issue.    By  contrast,  an 
accompanying  Declaration  must  have  been  made  for  every  shipment  of  the  relevant  goods.  
Further, both the CoO and Declaration must have been issued or made and possessed by the 
importer before the goods to which these documents relate were exported.  Both documents 
were  also  required  to  be  produced  by  the  importer  to  an  officer  of  Customs  and  Border 
Protection upon request. 

New  documentary  requirements  under  the  SAFTA  enable  a  CoO  to  be  used  for  a  single 
shipment (provided it is used within a year of its issue) or for multiple shipments (provided the 
shipments  occur  within  two  years  of  its  issue  and  the  first  shipment  occurred  within  the  first 
year).  Where a CoO is used for a single shipment of goods, a Declaration is not necessary.  
Where a CoO is used for multiple shipments of goods, a Declaration is not necessary for the 
first shipment but is required for every subsequent shipment. At a practical level, this will mean 
that a Declaration will not be required by the importer for the first shipment of goods specified 
in a CoO.  

The amendments will also require both the CoO and Declaration, if required, to be issued and 
possessed  by  the  importer  before  the  goods  to  which  the  documents  relate  are  entered  in 
Australia, as opposed to before the goods are exported.  This provides more time for the CoO 
and the Declaration to be obtained. 

The CoO and the Declaration, where required, must still be produced to an officer of Customs  
and Border Protection upon request. 

Subsection 153VE(1) of the Customs Act 1901 has been repealed and substituted by a new 
subsection. New subsection 153VE(1) implements the new documentary requirements under 
the  amendments  with  respect  to  a  claim  for  preferential  tariff  treatment  for  goods  imported 
from Singapore.  New subsection 153VE(1) provides that goods claimed to be the produce or

Amendment to Credit Card Surcharge on accounts payable to 
the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. 

From 15 April 2009, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will

August 2002. 

A surcharge has been payable for Internet and phone payments since 2004, 
and for payments received by Customs and Border Protection cashiers and 
duty collectors since May 2007. 

The rates that will apply for each card type from 15th April 2009 are:

•  MasterCard  0.94%  
1.54%

Form 43 Requirement For Ships’ Bunkers 

Section 129 of the Customs Act 1901(the Act) requires that the master or owner of a ship may 
make application to a Collector for the approval of the Collector to take ships stores on board 
the ship, having regard to the voyage to be undertaken and the number of passengers/crew.  
Application is to be made before the stores are taken on board. 

Ships stores are defined in Section 130C of the Act as stores for the use of the passengers or 
crew of a ship, or for the service of a ship.  Ships bunkers are stores for use in the service of a 
ship, and require the prior approval of a Collector to load on board. 

When bunkers are to be loaded at a port, the vessel’s master or delegate (usually the ship’s 
agent) is required to seek the approval of a delegate of the Collector by lodging a Form 43 prior 
to loading.  The form 43 will detail the types and quantities to be loaded. 

The master will advise Customs of the actual quantities and types of bunkers loaded by 
endorsing the Form 43. 

These changes take effect from 20 April 2009. 

Inquiries  concerning  this  notice  may  be  directed  to  seaports@customs.gov.au,  or  to  the

Repeal Of Customs Regulations 102 and 104 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service advises that two provisions of the 
Customs Regulations 1926 (the Customs Regulations) have been repealed with effect from 6 
June 2009.  These provisions are outlined below.   

Regulation 102 

Regulation 102 of the Customs Regulations provided that a Certificate of Clearance may be 
granted in respect of a ship only if: 

(a)  an application for the certificate has been made under subsection 118 (2) or (5) 

of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act); and 

(b)  an application has been made in accordance with Form 40. 

As Regulation 102 has been repealed, a Form 40 will no longer be required when applying for a 
Certificate of Clearance.  The application for clearance is prescribed by Regulation 98D, and is 
the Departure Report currently lodged in the ICS prior to obtaining clearance. 

Regulation 104 

Regulation 104 of the Customs Regulations required a Master of an overseas vessel to produce 
a Form 22A transire and produce it to Customs and Border Protection at or before the time of 
clearance at the first and each subsequent port of call in Australia.   

A Form 22A is now no longer required with the repeal of this Regulation.

Enhanced Project By-law Scheme (Item 71 of Schedule 4) – 
eligibility and compliance 

Before claiming concessional entry under an item of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995, 
importers and customs brokers must make certain that all goods are eligible.  For Enhanced 
Project By-law Scheme (EPBS) item 71, particular attention must be paid to ensuring that: 

1.  all goods satisfy the terms of item 71; and 
2. 

the imported equipment is specified in an AusIndustry Determination granted for the 
relevant project. 

Only then should treatment code 471, the relevant AusIndustry Determination and the access 
PIN be quoted on an import declaration. 

Through item 71, the EPBS provides for the duty free entry of eligible capital goods for major 
investment projects in the following industries: 

resource processing; 

•  mining; 
• 
•  agriculture; 
food processing; 
• 
• 
food packaging; 
•  manufacturing; 
•  gas supply; 
•  power supply; and 
•  water supply. 

The Minister of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Innovation) has policy 
responsibility for the EPBS, which is administered by the AusIndustry Division of the 
Department of Innovation.  According to current EPBS guidelines, to qualify for this concession 
investment projects must have a total project expenditure on capital goods of $10 million or 
greater.  Eligible goods are essentially capital equipment purchased for the project, such as: 

•  Functional units - One or more pieces of machinery, equipment or their components 

that are integrally connected to perform a process; or 

•  Procurement/equipment packages - A quantity of the same type of machinery, 

equipment and their components which is used across a project; or 

•  Pipes, pipelines, conveyors, flexible flow lines etc used to convey gas, liquids, minerals 

or other things; or 

•  Stainless steel materials to be directly incorporated into the goods identified above. 

Only eligible goods that are not produced in Australia, or are technologically superior to those 
made in Australia, are eligible for a concession under the EPBS.

100 Point identification requirement for ‘fit and proper person’ 
checks – Warehouse, Depot and Broker licence applications  

In 2002 Customs and Border Protection published an ACN (2002/22) outlining the requirements 
for establishing the identity of applicants for depot licences required to undergo a ‘fit and proper 
person’ check.  This notice replaces ACN 2002/22 and clarifies that the requirement applies to 
all applications for depot, broker and warehouse licences.   

When applying for a warehouse or depot licence, Customs and Border Protection requires 
information about persons nominated as directors, shareholders or employees who will 
participate in the management and/or control of a proposed premises. The applicant is advised 
that such persons will be the subject of a police records check.  The same requirement applies 
for applicants for a corporate or nominee brokers licence.  These persons are all required to 
complete a ‘consent to obtain personal information’ form.  Since 2002, as part of the application 
process and for each person completing the ‘consent to obtain personal information’ form, 
Customs and Border Protection has required 100 points of identification.  

In addition, any person who commences employment in a position of management or control in 
a licensed warehouse or depot subsequent to the granting of a licence or becomes a director of 
a licensed corporate brokerage is also subject to these checks.  

Each person required to establish their identity must do so by providing certified copies of the 
following documents which total 100 points or more: 

Primary Documents (70 points) - One document must be supplied from this category. No 
additional points for multiple documents. 

•  Birth Certificate 
•  Citizenship Certificate 
•  Current Passport 
•  Expired Passport which has not been cancelled and was current within the preceding 

two years 

•  Other document having the same characteristics as a passport including diplomatic 

documents and some documents issued to refugees 

Secondary Documents - One document from each point category can be used for the 
additional point score. 

Category 1 (40 Points) - Must have a photograph and a name  

•  Driver’s Licence issued by an Australian State or Territory 
•  Licence or permit issued under a law of the Commonwealth, State or Territory 

• 
• 

Government - (e.g. a boat licence) 
Identification card issued to a public employee 
Identification card issued by the Commonwealth, State or Territory Government as 
evidence of the  

•  person’s entitlement to a financial benefit 
•  An identification card issued to a student at a tertiary institution

Amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
Regulation 4C – Importation of asbestos. 

On 15 August 2009, regulation 4C of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 was 
amended by the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 2009 (No. 4). 

The amendment to regulation 4C removes the import control that applies to ships and resources 
installations containing in-situ amphibole or chrysotile asbestos, where the ship or resources 
installation 
• 
• 
• 

is of at least 150 gross tonnage; and 
the asbestos was fixed or installed before 1 January 2005; and 
the asbestos will not be a risk to any person unless it is disturbed. 

This amendment complements existing domestic occupational health and safety laws and does 
not alter industry’s obligations and responsibilities in respect of providing a safe workplace.  Ships 
and resources installations no longer subject to the import control are workplaces, and must 
comply with the relevant Commonwealth, State and/or Territory occupational health and safety 
laws, including those dealing with the management of asbestos in the workplace. 

The import control continues to prohibit the importation of ships or resources installations where 
the asbestos was fixed or installed after 1 January 2005 including where: 
• 

construction of a ship or resources installation began before 1 January 2005 but was not 
completed until 1 January 2005 or after; or 

•  due to repairs, refits or renovations, asbestos fixed or installed before 1 January 2005 is re-

fixed, re-installed, or replaced with other asbestos, on or after 1 January 2005. 

The gross tonnage threshold will ensure that smaller ships, including recreational vessels, and 
resources installations, remain subject to the import control. 

For queries concerning this ACN, please contact the Manager – Environment and Wildlife,

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2009-33.pdf,Indexation of certain customs and excise tariff duty rates – August 2009,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2009/33 

Indexation of certain customs and excise tariff duty rates – August 2009 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June Quarter 2009 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 22 July 2009.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the rates 
of customs and excise duties on certain spirits, beer and tobacco will increase on  
1 August 2009.  The new rates are set out in tables 1 to 5 of this Notice.   

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, ie the June Quarter 2009 number, by the previous highest December 
or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the June 2009 index 
number (167.0) has been divided by the December 2008 index number (166.0) to establish an 
indexation factor of 1.006.  As this factor is more than one, rates of customs and excise duty 
have been increased by the application of this factor.

 Luxury Car Tax in the Integrated Cargo System – Update  

This ACN supersedes ACN 2008/51 

This notice clarifies the reporting requirements for importers of certain fuel efficient luxury cars that 
are exempt from luxury car tax (LCT) at the time of importation on or after 3 October 2008. 
It also clarifies how the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) currently calculates LCT payable on fuel 
efficient luxury cars with a value exceeding the fuel efficient luxury threshold. 

Legislative Framework 

The A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 (LCT Act) is the legislative basis for the 
imposition of LCT on importation of luxury cars and fuel efficient luxury cars. 

LCT applies to motor vehicles (except motor cycles or similar vehicles) with a luxury car value that 
exceeds the LCT threshold of $57,180 that are: 

(cid:131)  designed to carry a load of less than two tonnes and fewer than nine passengers; and 
(cid:131)  which have a luxury car value (see below) above the threshold 

For LCT purposes, the definition of a car includes limousines regardless of the passenger 
carrying capacity. 

Fuel efficient luxury cars, are cars that have a fuel consumption of 7 litres per 100 kilometres or 
less as a combined rating under vehicle standards in force under section 7 of the Motor Vehicle 
Standards Act.  

LCT does not apply to fuel efficient cars below the fuel efficient luxury threshold of $75,000 for the 
2008-09 financial year. 

Certain luxury cars and fuel efficient luxury cars are entitled to exemption from the LCT. These 
include to certain emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire trucks and some vehicles specially 
fitted to transport people confined to wheel chairs. More information is available from 
www.ato.gov.au . 

How the Luxury Car value is calculated (for LCT purposes) 

The luxury car value (also known as luxury car tax value) is determined by the application of the 
formula below; 

Luxury car value = Value of the Taxable Importation (VoTI) + Goods and Services Tax (GST) 

                                   = VoTI x 11/10 

Where the VoTI is the sum of: 

(cid:131) 
the customs value;  
(cid:131)  any duty payable; and  
(cid:131) 

the amount paid or payable to transport the vehicle to Australia and to insure the 
vehicle for that transport. 

Example 1 – Importation of a luxury car with a customs value of $55,000 

(cid:131)  Duty payable (5%)  = $2,750 
(cid:131)  Transport and Insurance = $1,750 

Luxury car value = ($55,000 + $2,750 + $1,750) x 11/10 = $65,450

Tariff changes resulting from the commencement of the Customs Tariff 
Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Act 2009 – ‘Alcopops’, Beer and Grape 
Wine Product 

On 13 August 2009 the Senate passed the Customs Tariff Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) 
Bill 2009.  The legislation will commence the day after this Bill receives Royal Assent.  The Act 
amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff) by enacting changes previously 
included in the following Customs Tariff Proposals: 

•  No. 1 (2008) – Implemented new duty rates for certain alcoholic beverages (‘alcopops’); 
•  No. 3 (2009) – Continued in force the new duty rates.  

The legislation also changes the definitions for beer and grape wine product and inserts eight 
new tariff subheadings into Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff.   

The new definitions for beer and wine will exclude products that mimic spirit based pre-mixed 
drinks, commonly known as ‘alcopops’ or ‘RTD (ready to drink)’ beverages.  This will ensure 
that beer and wine based drinks that mimic ‘alcopops’ are taxed at the same rate as ‘alcopops’. 

Due to the change in definitions for beer and grape wine product, two existing tariff subheadings 
relating to beer will be deleted in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff and eight new subheadings 
will be created.  These changes will provide for goods that no longer meet the revised 
definitions of beer and grape wine product.  These goods will also be subject to higher or new 
excise equivalent duties as well as the ad valorem component of customs duty, where 
applicable. 

As drafted, the Bill did not include rates of duty that reflected the August 2009 CPI adjustments.  
Accordingly, a Customs Notice will be published in the Commonwealth Gazette to bring the 
excise equivalent component of the duty rates into line with that applying to excisable goods.  

Corresponding changes have been made to the relevant items and rates in Schedule 5 (US 
originating goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), and Schedule 7 (Chilean originating 
goods). 

The changes will take effect on the day after the legislation receives Royal Assent.  The 
commencement day will be advised when known.  Notification of the commencement day will 
be posted on the Customs and Border Protection website and the Integrated Cargo System. 

Existing statistical codes or subheadings that have been deleted will not operate on and from 
the commencement day.  The new subheadings and statistical codes must be used on import 
declarations on and from that day.  Tariff Working Pages to reflect these changes will be coded 
with ‘Operative AAA’. 

Equivalent changes will be made in the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the A New Tax System 
(Wine Equalisation Tax) Regulations 2000 (for grape wine product). 

Attached are details of the Tariff changes resulting from the legislative amendments.

 Luxury Car Tax in the Integrated Cargo System - Update (Amendment)  

This ACN supersedes ACN 2008/51 

This notice clarifies the reporting requirements for importers of certain fuel efficient luxury cars that 
are exempt from luxury car tax (LCT) at the time of importation on or after 3 October 2008. 
It also clarifies how the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) currently calculates LCT payable on fuel 
efficient luxury cars with a value exceeding the fuel efficient luxury car threshold. 

Legislative Framework 

The A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 (LCT Act) is the legislative basis for the 
imposition of LCT on importation of luxury cars and fuel efficient luxury cars. 

LCT applies to motor vehicles (except motor cycles or similar vehicles) with a Luxury Car value 
that exceeds the LCT threshold of $57,180 that are: 

(cid:131)  designed to carry a load of less than two tonnes and fewer than nine passengers; and 
(cid:131)  which have a Luxury Car value (see below) above the threshold. 

For LCT purposes, the definition of a car includes limousines regardless of the passenger 
carrying capacity. 

Fuel efficient luxury cars, are cars that have a fuel consumption of 7 litres per 100 kilometres or 
less as a combined rating under vehicle standards in force under section 7 of the Motor Vehicle 
Standards Act 1989.  

LCT does not apply to fuel efficient cars below the fuel efficient luxury car threshold of $75,000 for 
the 2008-09 financial year. 

Certain luxury cars and fuel efficient luxury cars are entitled to exemption from the LCT. These 
include certain emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire trucks and some vehicles specially 
fitted to transport people confined to wheel chairs. More information is available from 
www.ato.gov.au . 

How the Luxury Car value is calculated (for LCT purposes) 

The Luxury Car value (also known as Luxury Car tax value) is determined by the application of the 
formula below: 

Luxury Car value = Value of the Taxable Importation (VoTI) + Goods and Services Tax (GST) 

                                   = VoTI x 11/10 

Where the VoTI is the sum of: 

(cid:131) 
the customs value;  
(cid:131)  any duty payable; and  
(cid:131) 

the amount paid or payable to transport the vehicle to Australia and to insure the 
vehicle for that transport.

ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation 

Agreement 

The Agreement Establishing the ASEAN–Australia–New Zealand Free Trade 
Area (AANZFTA) was signed by the Minister for Trade, The Hon Simon Crean 
and his ASEAN and New Zealand counterparts, on 27 February 2009 in Hua 
Hin, Thailand. 

The ASEAN Member States are Brunei Darussalam, the Kingdom of Cambodia, 
the Republic of Indonesia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the 
Union of Myanmar, the Republic of the Philippines, the Republic of Singapore, 
the Kingdom of Thailand and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 

Entry into Force 

The AANZFTA will enter into force for Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, 
Myanmar (Burma), Brunei, the Philippines, and Vietnam on 1 January 2010. 

The entry into force date for the remaining ASEAN Member States (Thailand, 
Malaysia, Indonesia, Laos and Cambodia) is subject to implementation of 
domestic legislative requirements by those countries.   

Imported goods from these countries are not originating goods until the 
AANZFTA enters into force for these countries.  It is therefore not possible to 
apply the AANZFTA to goods imported from these countries until this occurs.   

A further ACN will be issued when the entry into force date for those countries is 
known.   

Preferential rates of customs duty 

The Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff), as amended by the Customs Tariff 
Amendment (ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation) Act 2009, will provide preferential rates of customs duty for 
AANZ originating goods.

Definition of “consignor” and “consignee” and Compliance 
Approach for the purposes of reporting cargo 

Purpose 

The purpose of this document is to clarify the reporting requirements as they relate to 
cargo arriving in Australia from a place outside Australia. In particular, the information 
required for advising consignee and consignor details on a cargo report submitted for 
the purposes of section 64AB of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act).  

Requirements 

Customs and Border Protection requires cargo reporters to report all goods they have 
arranged to be carried to Australia. Cargo reporters are obliged to report a separate 
cargo report for each consignee/consignor combination.  All cargo reports must be 
submitted through the Integrated Cargo System (ICS). 

Definitions of ‘consignee’ and ‘consignor’ for the reporting of cargo arriving in 
Australia 

Section 64AB(5a)and(5aa) of the Act defines a consignor as a supplier of goods who is 
located outside of Australia and who either initiates the sending of goods to a person in 
Australia, or complies with a request from a person in Australia to send goods to the 
person. 

Section 64AB(5b) of the Act defines a consignee as the ultimate recipient of the goods 
that have been sent from outside Australia whether or not the person ordered or paid 
for the goods.   

For each consignee/consignor combination, a separate cargo report must be provided 
through the ICS. Cargo reporters who have been engaged to assemble orders made 
up of consignments from multiple suppliers are required to enter into the ICS a cargo 
report for each supplier (consignor) and consignee.   

The reporting of logistics service provider details in the consignor and consignee fields 
of a cargo report will not meet the requirements of section 64AB (5) of the Act if: 

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

the logistics service provider is not the supplier of the goods or ultimate recipient 
but an intermediary or service provider; and  
the required information is available to the cargo reporter. 

When am I not required to provide the details of the actual consignor or 
consignee? 

The requirement to report consignee and consignor details set out above do not apply 
to cargo reporters who have entered into an arrangement for the carriage of the 
consignment on behalf of another cargo reporter.  In these circumstances, reporting 
requirements are covered under section 64AAB(2)and(3) of the Act.

Tariff, duty rate and statistical code changes for 1 January 2010 

This notice summarises tariff and statistical code changes that will occur on 1 January 2010. 

Reduction of duty rates for passenger motor vehicles and components 

Duty rates for passenger motor vehicles and parts components will be reduced from 10% 
(General rate of customs duty) to 5%, on 1 January 2010.  Duty rates will also be adjusted for 
preference countries in accordance with Australia's System of Tariff Preferences, provided 
under the Centralised System of Preferences.  The new duty rates for these goods are set out 
in the Customs Tariff Working Pages (Schedule 3) and, where required, in Schedules 5, 6 and 7 
(US, Thai and Chilean originating goods).  New Schedule 8 will also specify rates of duty 
applicable to AANZ originating goods, from 1 January 2010 (more information is available below 
on the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement). 

Reduced duty rates will apply to new and second hand passenger motor vehicles of heading 
8703 and to motor vehicle components classified in heading 8708 and other headings of the 
Customs Tariff. 

These duty rate reductions will not affect existing tariff classification numbers or their associated 
statistical codes. 

Item 53C in Schedule 4 

Item 53C in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff) provides reduced rates 
of duty (from 10% to 5%) for certain goods when not of a kind used as components in 
passenger motor vehicles.  Following the reduction of duty rates for motor vehicle components 
to 5%, item 53C will be redundant. 

Item 53C operates through treatment code 853.  Section 18(1) of the Customs Tariff provides 
that a concessional item in Schedule 4 can only be used if the concessional rate of duty is less 
than the rate provided through Schedules 3, 5, 6, 7 or 8. 

In accordance with this provision, importers should note that treatment code 853 will not operate 
in the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) from 1 January 2010.  Importers should take action to 
remove treatment code 853 from import declarations created in the ICS from that date. 

Amendment to Schedule 4 item 59 

Item 59 in Schedule 4 provides the mechanism to remove the duty of $12,000 per vehicle on 
used or second hand vehicles, subject to conditions specified in Customs by-laws. 

The applicable duty rate of 10% for this item will be reduced to 5%.

Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement – Change in refund 
circumstance for safeguard goods 

Special safeguard provisions which apply to certain Thai originating goods that are defined 
under section 16A of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff Act) as ‘safeguard goods’, 
concluded on 31 December 2008.  

Section 16A of the Tariff Act specified the quantities of Thai safeguard goods that could be 
imported into Australia in a particular calendar year (between 2005 through to 2008) with a 
‘Free’ rate of customs duty, provided that other requirements of the Thailand-Australia Free 
Trade Agreement were met.  Any safeguard goods imported in excess of these quantities 
during that calendar year were dutiable at the full rate of customs duty.   

From 1 January 2009 onwards, all quantities of safeguard goods can be imported with a ‘Free’ 
rate of customs duty.   

Regulation 126B of the Customs Regulations 1926  (the Regulations) prescribes the 
circumstances under which refunds of customs duty can be made for Thai originating goods 
excluding ‘safeguard goods’.  As the safeguard measure has become inoperative from 
1 January 2009, subregulation 126B(2) of the Regulations has been amended to allow refunds 
of customs duty to be paid on Thai originating goods that are safeguard goods, where the 
goods have been imported into Australia on or after 1 January 2009.  For Thai originating goods 
which were safeguard goods imported before 1 January 2009, the refund exclusion will still 
apply.   

This change takes effect from 28 November 2009.

End-date for item 53C in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 

Item 53C in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 provides a mechanism to reduce rates 
of Customs duty for goods that are not “of a kind used as components in passenger motor 
vehicles”, to the rate that applies to other manufactured goods.  Item 53C reduces the General 
rate of duty from 10% to 5% for such goods. 

On 1 January 2010, the General rate of Customs duty for components for passenger motor 
vehicles will fall from 10% to 5%.  (Australian Customs Notice 2009/49 refers).  As a 
consequence, there will no longer be a need for the item 53C concession and the item will be

INCREASED PENALTIES FOR ‘COMMERCIAL’ IMPORT/EXPORT OF 
OBJECTIONABLE GOODS 

The penalties applying to the commercial importation and exportation of objectionable goods have 
increased with effect from 16 December 2009. 

 Penalties exist for all breaches of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and Customs 
(Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958.  For more serious breaches, the Customs Regulations 1926 
provide higher levels known as Tier 1 and Tier 2 that attract higher penalties. Tier 1 offences currently 
attract penalties of up to $110,000 in fines and/or five years imprisonment. Tier 2 currently attracts 
penalties of $275,000 and /or 10 years imprisonment.  

The importation and exportation of objectionable goods is prohibited by regulation 4A of the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and Regulation 3 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 
1958. The criteria for determining objectionable goods are consistent with the RC (Refused Classification) 
criteria in the National Classification Code and the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer 
Games) Act 1995. 

‘Objectionable’ covers a wide range of material, including offensive or sexualised violence, illustrations of 
beastiality, harmful or disgusting fetishes, offensive fantasies, terrorist material and drug use.  It can be 
contained in publications, films, computer games or computer generated images.  It may also include the 
more serious offences of child pornography and child abuse material that are already subject to Tier 2 
penalties. 

From 16 December 2009 ‘commercial quantities’ of objectionable goods are listed as Tier 1 goods under 
the Customs Regulations 1926 (the Regulations).    The new penalties apply to the import/export of 
objectionable goods above a set threshold or the import of objectionable goods for a prescribed purpose 
(as described below).   

Tier 1 penalties apply to categories of objectionable material defined in the Customs Regulations 1926 as 
either: 

i) The import or export of 25 items or more; or  
ii) Goods imported for the purpose of: 

(a) selling the good;  
(b) letting the good for hire;  
(c) by way of trade, offering or exposing the good for sale or hire;  
(d) distributing the good for the purpose of trade; or 
(e) exhibiting or displaying the good in public. 

The new provisions do not affect the existing Tier 2 penalties for more serious offences involving child 
pornography and child abuse material.   

Enquiries regarding the policy can be made to the Attorney-General’s Department on telephone (02) 6141 
3464 or via email to christopher.lee@ag.gov.au  Further information on classification requirements can be 
found at www.classification.gov.au

tobacco products – operative on and from 30 April 2010 

The Government announced today (29 April 2010) increases in the excise and excise-equivalent rates of 
duty for tobacco and tobacco products. 

Customs Notice (No. 1) 2010 was published in Special Commonwealth Gazette No. S 62 of 29 April 2010 
to give effect to that announcement.  This Notice increases the excise-equivalent rates of customs duty 
applying to tobacco products from $0.26220 (as at 1 February 2010) to $0.32775 per stick not exceeding 
in weight 0.8 grams actual tobacco content, and from $327.77 (as at 1 February 2010) to $409.71 per 
kilogram of tobacco content for ‘other’ tobacco.   

The new rates will come into effect on and from 30 April 2010 and will apply to goods: 

(a)  imported into Australia on or after 30 April 2010; and 

(b)  imported into Australia before 30 April 2010, where the time for working out the rate of import duty 

on the goods had not occurred before that date. 

Equivalent changes will also be made to the duty rates for the corresponding items in the Excise Tariff  
Act 1921, on that date. 

The new rates of customs duty will apply to goods imported from all sources, including under Australia’s 
Free Trade Agreements: Schedule 5 (US originating goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), 
Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods) and Schedule 8 (AANZ originating goods) in the Customs Tariff. 

The following Table sets out the new rates of duty.

Applicant’s obligations when applying for a Tariff Concession 
Order (TCO)  

Customs and Border Protection has introduced a new application form (B443) for Tariff 
Concession Orders (TCOs) to take effect 29 March 2010. 

The new form reinforces obligations for TCO applicants to provide evidence that satisfies the 
CEO (Chief Executive Officer) that there are reasonable grounds for asserting that the TCO 
application meets core criteria.  Specifically, the legislation requires provision of all information 
that an applicant has, or can reasonably be expected to have, and all inquiries that an applicant 
has made or can reasonably be expected to make. (Section 269FA of the Customs Act 1901). 

This notice provides advice for applicants for TCOs on how to complete the new Approved 
Form (B443) when making an application.  

An application meets the core criteria if, on the day of lodgement of the application, no 
substitutable goods were produced in Australia in the ordinary course of business. 

The legislation and relevant policy guidelines require that Customs and Border Protection be 
rigorous in ensuring applicants meet their obligations when lodging an application. 
This is because some applicants for TCOs are providing less than reasonable information and 
conducting less than reasonable inquiries to determine whether Australian manufacturers of 
substitutable goods exist.   

Customs and Border Protection has noted that, in some instances, the level of information 
provided in applications has been superficial and has, accordingly, rejected those applications.   
Customs and Border Protection is aware of occasions when TCOs have been applied for when 
it is clear, from subsequent investigation and/or legal challenge, that the applicant must have 
known that substitutable goods were produced, or potentially produced, yet failed to provide this 
information on the form.  It is not the intent of the Tariff Concession System that an applicant 
should apply for a concession in the hope that a potential producer of substitutable goods will 
not object.  

As a result of these concerns, Customs and Border Protection has amended the approved form 
for TCO applications which now requests more specific responses from applicants.  This form 
replaces the old Form B443, which should not be used after 29 March 2010.  The new form can 
be downloaded from Customs’ website – www.customs.gov.au 

The form has been amended to reflect a practice where the applicant is not always the importer 
of the goods, but may be an agent, consultant or broker who does not always have first-hand 
knowledge of the particular goods or industry involved.  It is important, where the importer is not 
the applicant, that information is provided by the intended importer of the goods to the applicant 
and included in the form.

Indexation of certain customs and excise tariff duty rates – February 2010 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December Quarter 2009 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 27 January 2010.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the rates 
of customs and excise duties on certain spirits, beer and tobacco increased on  
1 February 2010.  The new rates are set out in tables 1 to 6 of this Notice. 

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, i.e. the December Quarter 2009 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
December 2009 index number (169.5) has been divided by the June 2009 index number (167.0) 
to establish an indexation factor of 1.015.  As this factor is more than one, rates of customs and 
excise duty have been increased by the application of this factor.

NEW IMPORT CONTROL ON TABLET PRESSES 

The importation of tablet presses is to be controlled under Regulation 4G of the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (PI Regulations).  The control will come into effect on 
1 March 2010. 

It is being introduced to reduce the supply of illicit drugs.  Tablet presses are highly sought after 
by criminal organisations for use in the domestic manufacture of these drugs.  

Tablet presses are defined as semi-automatic or fully automatic equipment that can be used for 
the compaction or moulding of powdered or granular solids, or semi-solid material, to produce 
coherent solid tablets.  The control does not include encapsulators or tablet press parts such as 
punches or dies. 

The Attorney-General’s Department has policy responsibility for the control and will initially 
administer the permission arrangements.  The permission regime will be based on “registered” 
importers.  importers must apply to the Attorney-General’s Department in writing using the 
application form which an be found on the Attorney-General’s Department website at 
http://www.ag.gov.au/tabletpresses  

A permission can specify conditions or requirements such as the length of time for which an 
approval is valid, and/or the number of tablet presses that can be imported.  The Minister or an 
authorised person has the power to revoke a permission where the holder does not comply with 
a condition or requirement.

Customs and Border Protection Officers’ Power to Enter and 
Remain In Certain Places 

In the course of their duties, Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officers (and 
persons assisting an officer) will be required to access certain places to carry out their role as 
Commonwealth law enforcement officers. An officer’s power to enter and remain in certain 
places is granted through the operation of various legislative instruments, in particular through 
Section 193 of the Customs Act 1901.  This Notice provides advice on the places/locations 
officers may access, equipment they may carry, how officers will enforce these powers and 
what obligations (if any) are placed upon the occupiers (including owners and operators) of 
these places. 

What status do Customs and Border Protection officers hold? 

Officers of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service are law enforcement officers 
through  the  operation  of  a  range  of  legislative  instruments,  in  particular  Division  146.1  of  the 
Criminal  Code  Act  1995,  Section  3  of  the  Crimes  Act  1914  and  Section  151  of  the  Maritime 
Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 (MTOFSA). 

What places can officers access? 

Officers can enter and remain in the following places (whether they are public areas or privately 
owned),  without  the  need  for  a  warrant  or  the  permission  of  the  relevant  owner,  occupier  or 
operator: 
•  the coast, including but not limited to: 

o the shores, banks and beaches of the coast; 
o any man-made structure in or on the coast; 
•  a port, bay or harbour, including but not limited to: 

o the shores, banks and beaches of the port, bay or harbour; 
o any man-made structure in or on the port, bay or harbour; 

•  an airport or airstrip; 
•  a lake or river, including but not limited to: 

o the shores, banks and beaches of the lake or river; 
o any man-made structure in or on the lake or river; 

•  for the purpose of entering and remaining upon a place mentioned above - an area of land or 

water that is adjacent to that place. 

When in these places, officers will be completing a range of border protection (and associated) 
activities,  including  the  boarding  of  ships  and  aircraft  and  exercising  their  powers  to  search 
goods, people, vehicles, ships and aircraft. 

What  about  places  where  regular  or  ongoing  access  is  required  e.g.  ports, 
wharves, etc? 

Where  officers  have  identified  an  ongoing  requirement  to  access  certain  places  they  will 
establish contact with occupants to identify a reasonable means of regular access to that place. 
In most cases this will require occupants to provide officers with the appropriate ‘swipe-cards’, 
keys  or  other  relevant  access  device  to  enable  immediate  access  to  places  as  operational 
requirements dictate.

New United Nations sanctions on trade in arms and related matériel to and 
from Eritrea 

On 23 December 2009, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted resolution 1907, 
banning trade in arms and related materiel to and from Eritrea. The resolution was adopted in 
response to ongoing border disputes between Djibouti and Eritrea, and Eritrea’s support of armed 
groups in Somalia which constitute a threat to international peace and security.  

Resolution 1907 obliges Member States to take steps to prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale 
or transfer to and from, Eritrea of arms or related matériel, including paramilitary goods. Australia 
complies with UNSC Sanctions through a range of measures, including administration and 
enforcement of the Customs Regulations.  

Accordingly, as of 2 March 2010, the importation from Eritrea of arms and related matériel 
(including paramilitary equipment) is prohibited under Regulation 4ZA of the 
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 unless permission has been granted by 
the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  

Also as of 2 March 2010, the exportation of arms and related matériel whose immediate or final 
destination is, or is intended to be, Eritrea is prohibited under Regulation 13CR of the 
Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 unless permission has been granted by the 
Minister for Foreign Affairs. Regulation 13CR does not include goods listed in the 
Defence and Strategic Goods List, which are covered under Regulation 13E.   

The import or export of goods in contravention of these regulations is an offence under the 
Customs Act 1901. Penalties for individuals can include imprisonment for up to 10 years, or a fine of 
up to three times the value of the goods or $275 000, whichever is the greater. Penalties for bodies 
corporate can include fines of up to three times the value of the goods or $1 100 000 whichever is 
the greater.  

Public enquiries on permit requirements and application processes under these regulations should 
be directed to:

Definition of import sales transaction 

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) seeks to clarify the definition of “import 
sales transaction” within the valuation provisions in Division 2 of Part VIII of the 
Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) and to ensure that the correct customs value 
is determined when an importation has multiple contracts of sale.   

Since the commencement of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade 
Agreement (AANZFTA), the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service 
has received numerous questions from importers and brokers in regard to the 
Free on Board (FOB) price on the certificate of origin (CoO) being different from 
the FOB price on the invoice used to determine the customs value.   

Our enquiries have established that the cause of the problem is not an incorrect 
FOB price on the CoO but the use of an incorrect sales contract as the import 
sales transaction.  The use of an incorrect sales contract as the import sales 
transaction has resulted in the determination of an incorrect customs value 
which is higher than that which would have been determined if the correct 
import sales transaction was used. 

The following example illustrates this problem.

Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010 – End-dates for items 53C, 61 
and 73 in Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff 

The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010 was introduced into the House of 
Representatives on 11 March 2010.  When enacted, the Bill will amend the Customs Tariff  
Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff) to provide end-dates for three concessional items in Schedule 4, 
as follows: 

•  Legislate an end-date of 31 December 2009 for item 53C; 
• 
Insert an end-date of 30 June 2010 for item 61; and 
•  Amend the end-date of item 73 from 30 June 2017 to 30 June 2011. 

Item 53C 

Item 53C in Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff provided a mechanism to reduce the general rate 
of customs duty from 10% to 5% for certain goods entered for home consumption on or  
after 1 January 2005, and that were not of a kind used as components in passenger motor 
vehicles.   

On 1 January 2010, the general rate of customs duty of 10% on passenger motor vehicles and 
their parts and components fell to 5%, in accordance with previous legislation.  Consequently, 
item 53C became redundant from that date.   

The insertion of the 31 December 2009 end-date into item 53C was previously given effect 
through the publication of Customs Notice (No. 3) 2009 in Special Commonwealth Gazette 
S213 of 14 December 2009, under the provisions of section 273EA of the Customs Act 1901.  
ACN 2009/54 refers.  Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010 contains an amendment to 
incorporate that end-date into item 53C in the Customs Tariff. 

Items 61 and 73 

The amendments to items 61 and 73 relate to import concessions for the textile, clothing and 
footwear (TCF) industries.  Item 61 gives effect to the Expanded Overseas Assembly Provisions  
(EOAP) Scheme and item 73 to the Product Diversification Scheme (PDS) for certain clothing 
and finished textiles.  

The amendments to these items reflect the Government's change of policy, from providing 
assistance through tariff concessions to providing a wider range of support to TCF industries, as 
set out in the Government’s TCF Innovation Package, announced in the 2009-10 Budget. 

The EOAP provides duty concessions, through item 61, for certain TCF goods that are 
manufactured overseas from Australian fabric and are subsequently imported back to Australia.   

The amendment to item 61 inserts the text “and entered for home consumption on or before  
30 June 2010” into the item.  This amendment provides an end-date of 30 June 2010 for the 
item, but also requires that goods that are potentially eligible for the item 61 concession must be 
entered for home consumption, on or before 30 June 2010. 

Importers should note that treatment codes 461 and 561 that give effect to item 61 will not 
operate on and from 1 July 2010.

Introduction of Duty Drawback claim functionality in the  
Integrated Cargo System 

Recent enhancements to the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) provide for electronic lodgement of 
duty drawback claims via the Customs Interactive (CI) facility effective from 23 March 2010.  
The CI functionality includes lodgement, search, amendment and withdrawal. 

To assist users with the electronic lodgement of drawback claims in the ICS, a user support 
manual is available from the Customs and Border Protection website at www.customs.gov.au 
then selecting Import/Export > Exporting Goods > Facilitation and concession schemes. 

The system has been trialled successfully with selected industry partners for more than six 
months and is now available for widespread use by industry.  The use of software or electronic 
data interchange (EDI) to lodge duty drawback claims is not available.    

Electronic lodgement of drawback claims will improve efficiencies and effectiveness of the 
scheme for both industry and Customs and Border Protection.  Such improvements will include 
faster payment of claims that go green-line, savings through reductions in paper-based 
transactions, and a capability for industry to monitor the progress of the transaction via the ICS. 

If you have not already communicated electronically with the ICS, there are some preparatory 
steps that must be followed beforehand.  These steps are outlined on the Customs and Border 
Protection website (www.customs.gov.au) by selecting from the home page Cargo Support > 
Connecting to the ICS > First Time Users.  These steps include the purchase of a digital 
certificate, downloading free software and ICS registration. 

For any further assistance with communicating electronically with the ICS, please contact the 
Cargo Support section at cargosupport@customs.gov.au or 1300 558 099.  

It is important to note that duty drawback claims for excise equivalent goods (such as alcohol 
and tobacco) and those claims containing dumping or interim dumping duty are not currently 
eligible for electronic lodgement in the ICS.  Such claims must continue to be lodged via the 
current manual process.   

The manual lodgement facility will remain in place as an alternative and information on that 
process can be obtained from the ‘Export Concessions Duty Drawback Scheme’ Fact Sheet 
which is located on the Customs and Border Protection website (www.customs.gov.au). 

Inquiries concerning this notice can be directed to either drawbacks@customs.gov.au or to the 
Drawbacks Section national contact number 1300 304 322.

On 19 March 2010, the Government announced as part of its better regulation and

Schedule 4 provides tariff concessions for a range of imported goods under different

Customs Notice (No. 1) 2010 – Increased rates of duty for tobacco 
products 

The Government announced on 29 April 2010 increases in the excise and excise-equivalent 
rates of duty for tobacco and tobacco products. 

The excise-equivalent component of the customs duty increased from $0.26220 (as at 
1 February 2010) to $0.32775 per stick (applying to cigarettes, cigars etc not exceeding 0.8 
grams per stick of tobacco content) and from $327.77 (as at 1 February 2010) to $409.71 per 
kilogram of tobacco content for ‘other’ tobacco.   

Publication of Customs Notice (No. 1) 2010 in Special Commonwealth Gazette No. S 62 of 29 
April 2010 gave effect to the new rates.  Excise Notice (No. 1) 2010, published in Special 
Commonwealth Gazette No. S 63 of 29 April 2010 made equivalent changes to the duty rates 
for the corresponding items in the Excise Tariff Act 1921, for locally manufactured goods. 

The new rates came into effect from 30 April 2010 and apply to goods imported into Australia on 
and from 30 April 2010. 

Tariff classifications in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff affected by the increase are set out in 
the Table below.  These rate increases apply to goods imported from all sources, including 
under Australia’s Free Trade Agreements: Schedule 5 (US originating goods), Schedule 6 (Thai 
originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods) and Schedule 8 (AANZ originating 
goods) of the Customs Tariff. 

Any inquiries concerning these matters should be directed to the Manager, Tariff Legislation 
telephone (02) 6275 6542. 

Customs Tariff pages to be issued in connection with these changes are Schedule 3 Chapter 
24/3 (R.33), Schedule 5 5/3 (R.17), Schedule 6 6/3 (R.16), Schedule 7 7/3 (R.4) and 
Schedule 8 8/3 (R.2). 

The above tariff reprint pages will be issued in the week commencing 10 May 2010.

Infringement Notice Scheme (INS): 

Legislation and Guidelines Amendments 

Background 

On 22 May 2009 the Customs Amendment (Enhanced Border Controls and Other 
Measures) Act 2009 received royal assent. This legislation was introduced to formalise 
the undertaking to industry that when considering sanctions, Customs and Border 
Protection would base its calculations for Cargo Report timeliness on the Actual Arrival 
of a vessel or aircraft. This refers to consideration for sanctions only and does not 
negate the legal requirement for Cargo Reporters to lodge their reports based on the 
estimated time of arrival. 

New offences were also introduced relating to accounting for and keeping safe goods 
that are subject to the control of Customs and Border Protection, including goods 
unloaded and stored at a Cargo Terminal Operator (wharf or airport), and goods held in 
a section 77G licensed depot or a section 79 licensed warehouse. 

Failing to Account for Goods and Keeping Goods Safely 

The Customs Act 1901 requires people who deal with dutiable goods that are subject 
to the control of Customs and Border Protection (i.e. between importation and delivery 
following the payment of duty, GST etc) to keep those goods safely and account for 
them if requested. If these obligations are not satisfied, Customs and Border Protection 
can demand the payment of the duty on those goods. 

Prior to this legislative change, there was no appropriate penalty to enforce the 
requirement to keep non-dutiable goods safe. While no duty applies to these goods, 
the goods still need to be accounted for as the goods may be prohibited by or subject 
to a restriction under the Customs Act 1901 or another law of the Commonwealth. 

New offences have been created for failing to keep goods which are subject to the 
control of Customs and Border Protection safely and failing to account for such goods 
to the satisfaction of a Collector of Customs and Border Protection if required to do so.

No updates to the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity 
Classification on 1 July 2010 

The Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) is compiled by the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and is based on the six-digit international harmonized 
system developed by the World Customs Organization for describing internationally traded 
goods. 

The AHECC is designed for use by exporters, customs brokers and freight forwarders for the 
classification of goods when providing export declarations to the Australian Customs and 
Border Protection Service, and to assist users in the interpretation of export statistics published 
by the ABS. The classification is normally updated on 1 January and 1 July each year. 

The January 2010 issue is the current version of the AHECC.  There have been no 
changes to the classification since January 2010. 

Copies of the entire AHECC and previous AHECC updates are available from the 
ABS web site free of charge.  To access these documents, go to the ABS web site 
www.abs.gov.au and type in AHECC in the search field.   

Enquires about this ACN should be directed to the Classification and Confidentiality 
Manager, at the ABS, on (02) 6252 5409 or by email international.trade@abs.gov.au.

Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2010 – Schedule 4, 
items 53C, 61 and 73 / confirmation of statistical codes for 
1 July 2010 

The Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2010 (the CTAA) received Royal Assent on 
28 June 2010 as Act No. 64 of 2010.  The CTAA amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the 
Tariff Act) by end-dating import concessions items 53C, 61 and 73 of Schedule 4 (Australian 
Customs Notices No. 2009/54 and 2010/14 refer). 

Item 53C in Schedule 4 

Item 53C provided a mechanism for the reduction of the general rate of customs duty from 10% 
to 5% for goods that were not of a kind used as components in passenger motor vehicles.  
Item 53C became redundant on 1 January 2010 and was end-dated by Customs Notice (No. 3) 
2009 and Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2010.  The CTAA provides an  
end-date of 31 December 2009 for item 53C.  

As previously advised in ACN 2009/54, treatment code 853 for item 53C ceased operation in 
the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) from 1 January 2010. 

Items 61 and 73 in Schedule 4 

The CTAA provides an end-date of 30 June 2010 for concessional item 61 relating to the 
Expanded Overseas Assembly Provisions Scheme and an end-date of 30 June 2011 for  
item 73 relating the Product Diversification Scheme (PDS) for certain clothing and finished 
textiles. 

A person seeking to rely on item 61 must ensure the relevant goods enter home consumption 
on or before 30 June 2010.  Treatment codes 461 and 561 that give effect to item 61 will cease 
operation on 1 July 2010.

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Act 2010 (the CTATA) received Royal Assent on 
29 June 2010 as Act No.77 of 2010.  The CTATA amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to

content, and from $327.77 to $409.71 per kilogram for other tobacco.  Customs Tariff Proposal 
(No. 2) 2010 previously notified these changes. 

The Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Act 2010 amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 for locally

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2010-33.pdf,Changes to the calculation of the Value of Taxable Importation (VoTI) for domestic transport supplies,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2010/33 

Changes to the calculation of the Value of Taxable Importation (VoTI) for 
domestic transport supplies 

This notice is to advise of amendments to the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 
1999 (GST Act) that will change the determination of the VoTI in certain circumstances.  It 
replaces information in ACN 2005/23, which Customs and Border Protection will review and 
reissue. 

Tax Laws Amendment (2010 GST Administration Measures No. 3) Act 2010 Schedule 1 made the 
relevant amendments to the GST Act.  

The changes relate primarily to importations made on a door-to-door basis.  Typically known as 
delivered duty paid or delivered duty unpaid where the supply agreement is for the sale of the 
goods to the local purchaser and the domestic transport of the goods forms part of the agreement 
for the international transport. 

The previous legislative arrangements 

Prior to these amendments, the supply of transport services for non postal goods transported from 
overseas to Australia by transport providers was GST-free up to the port or airport of final 
destination (being the place of consignment as defined under previous law) and the Australian leg 
of the inbound transport of goods from the port or airport of final destination was taxable.  Place of 
consignment was different for postal and non-postal goods.  As a result, for postal goods GST-free 
treatment applied to international transport services up to the Australian address identified on the 
post article. 

New legislative framework 

Under the amended GST Act, for most door-to-door deliveries, the cost of the domestic transport 
and insurance and the costs of loading, handling and other services from the port or airport to the 
place of delivery in Australia will be GST-free: 

• 

• 

for the supplier who brings the goods to Australia (typically a non-resident who is not in 
Australia), or  
for subcontractors who supply services to a non-resident who is not in Australia. 

These costs, to the extent there is no double counting, will generally be included in the VoTI. 

This change ensures the tax liability falls to the importer of the goods rather than the non-resident 
entity with a responsibility to provide the transport of the imported goods. 

Please refer to the ATO fact sheet at http://www.ato.gov.au/content/00247194.htm for further 
information on the new laws.

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – August 2010 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June Quarter 2010 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 28 July 2010.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the rates 
of customs and excise duties on certain spirits, beer and tobacco will increase on  
2 August 2010.  The new rates are set out in tables 1 to 6 of this Notice. 

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, that is, the June Quarter 2010 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
June 2010 index number (172.1) has been divided by the December 2009 index number (169.5) 
to establish an indexation factor of 1.015.  As this factor is more than one, rates of customs and 
excise duty have been increased by the application of this factor. 

Customs and Border Protection has arranged for the publication of a Notice of Substituted 
Rates of Customs Duty (Notice (No. 2) 2010) in Commonwealth Gazette GN 30 on Wednesday 
4 August 2010.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2010-40.pdf,Luxury Car Tax Threshold and Fuel Efficient Vehicle Limit - changes,"CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE No. 2010/40 

 Luxury Car Tax Threshold and Fuel Efficient Vehicle Limit - Changes 

This notice is to advise of the recent increase in the luxury car tax (LCT) threshold and an increase 
in the fuel efficient vehicle limit for the 2010-11 financial year. It also clarifies how the Integrated 
Cargo System (ICS) calculates LCT payable on fuel efficient luxury cars with a value exceeding the 
fuel efficient luxury car threshold. 

The Australia Taxation Office has determined that from 1 July 2010 the following are effective: 

•  LCT Threshold 
•  Fuel efficient vehicle limit 

$57,466 
$75,375 

The increased LCT threshold and fuel efficient vehicle limit advised in this notice supersede those in 
ACN 2009/41. 

How the Luxury Car value is calculated (for LCT purposes) 

The luxury car value (also known as luxury car tax value) is determined by the application of the 
formula below; 

Luxury car value = Value of the Taxable Importation (VoTI) + Goods and Services Tax (GST) 

                                   = VoTI x 11/10 

Where the VoTI is the sum of: 

(cid:1) 
the customs value;  
(cid:1)  any duty payable; and  
(cid:1) 

the amount paid or payable to transport the vehicle to Australia and to insure the 
vehicle for that transport. 

Example 1 – Importation of a luxury car with a customs value of $55,000 

(cid:1)  Duty payable (5%)  = $2,750 
(cid:1)  Transport and Insurance = $1,750 

Luxury car value = ($55,000 + $2,750 + $1,750) x 11/10 = $65,450 

How LCT is determined for Luxury Cars and Fuel Efficient Luxury Cars 

Luxury Cars 

The LCT threshold is reviewed each year. For the 2010-11 financial year, the threshold is $57,466. 
The LCT rate is 33 per cent for cars with a Luxury Car value over the LCT threshold.  

LCT is paid on the GST exclusive amount that exceeds $57,466. (See formula below) 

LCT = (luxury car value – LCT threshold) x 10/11 x LCT rate  

Illustration based on Example 1:  

LCT = ($65,450 – $57,466) x 10/11 x 33% = $2,395 

Fuel Efficient Luxury Cars 

LCT does not apply to fuel efficient cars below the fuel efficient luxury threshold of $75,375 for the 
2010-11 financial year. However, the LCT rate of 33% remains applicable where a fuel efficient 
luxury car exceeds the fuel efficient luxury threshold. LCT payable for fuel efficient luxury cars is 
calculated in accordance with the formula below:

NO. 2010/43 

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme - Allocations for 2010-2011  

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service advises that it has determined 2010-11 
allocations under the Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme that it administers on behalf of the 
Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.  Customs and Border Protection previously 
published the allocation attached to this notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette - 
Tariff Concessions No. 2010/27 of 7 July 2010. 

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 
23-month period ending 31 May 2010, as shown in Customs’ records of clearances for home 
consumption.  This calculation excludes any part of the quota that transferred to another 
importer during the 23-month period or that was unused as at 31 May 2010.   

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota 
allocated, importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or 
curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that 
year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian goods), 
or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, preference 
circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement, quota is unable to be used.  

The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a) 
(b) 

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs, and   
the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port 
or airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged. 

Quota allocations are transferable between importers.  A person may apply to transfer quota 
entitlements by completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) 
available at www.customs.gov.au.  The website also contains a Fact Sheet about the Cheese 
and Curd Quota.

telephone (02) 6275 6483.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2010-44.pdf,"Intention to revoke Tariff Concession Orders 9801683, 0509577 and 0509830 for certain light trucks","AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2010/44 

Intention to revoke Tariff Concession Orders 9801683, 0509577 and 
0509830 for certain light trucks 

On 8 September 2010, a delegate of the CEO of Customs and Border Protection published a 
Notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette: Tariff Concessions indicating an intention to 
revoke three tariff concession orders (TCOs) for certain light trucks classified to tariff 
subheading 8704.21.10. 

The delegate believes the TCOs are not worded correctly as they provide access to duty 
concessions for some light trucks that is broader than permitted by the Customs Act 1901 
(Customs Act) and the Customs Regulations 1926 (the Regulations).  Specifically, the TCOs 
provide concessional entry for trucks with a gross vehicle weight (g.v.w.) of 3.5 tonne or less 
when these goods are excluded from obtaining concessional entry by Regulation 185 and item 
39 of Schedule 2 (the Excluded Goods Schedule) of the Regulations. 

Interested parties have 28 days from the publication of the notice in the Gazette to provide 
reasons why any of these TCOs should not be revoked.  Within 60 days of the publication of 
above notice, the delegate will decide, having regard to any submissions made within the 28 
days and any other relevant matters, whether to continue with the revocation of the TCOs.  If 
the TCOs are revoked, then the operative date of the revocation will be 6 September 2010. 

Please note that the legislation does not permit the automatic making of a narrower 
replacement TCO in these circumstances.  If importers wish to apply for a narrower TCO (i.e. 
one for trucks exceeding a g.v.w. of 3.5t) then they must apply in the usual way using the new 
B443 form.   

In-transit provisions 

If a decision is made to revoke the TCOs, then subsection 269SG(2) of the Customs Act 
provides for in-transit provisions to apply for goods that: 

•  were imported into Australia by the day the revocation came into effect (i.e. revocation 
operative date), and are entered for home consumption within 28 days thereafter, or 

•  were in transit to Australia on the day the revocation came into effect (i.e. revocation 
operative date), and are entered for home consumption within 28 days thereafter. 

In-transit provisions will apply, but only in respect of vehicles with a g.v.w. exceeding 3.5t, which 
are the goods to which the TCO validly applies. 

Recovery action 

In most cases, Customs and Border Protection will not seek to recover any relevant duty 
foregone.  However, that general rule will not apply if Customs and Border Protection finds 
evidence indicating that a person who received the concession did so through fraudulent 
conduct or was aware that the vehicle for which they received the concession should not have 
been covered by a TCO.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2010-45.pdf,Importation of asbestos or goods containing asbestos,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS NOTICE NO. 2010/45 

Importation of asbestos or goods containing asbestos. 

This Notice is being issued following the detection of asbestos in a range of pre-
assembled and pre-manufactured equipment imported for use in Australia’s 
resource exploration and development industry.     

Asbestos (chrysotile and amphibole), and goods containing asbestos are controlled under 
Regulation 4C and Schedule 3B of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956.  
Importation of asbestos, or goods containing asbestos, is prohibited without a permit.  

Asbestos has recently been detected in a wide range of imported goods, including 
gaskets, jointing materials in flues, furnaces, ducts, pipe spools, heating equipment and 
pressurised hoses.  It has also been detected in packaging for these goods. 

As a result, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is actively targeting imported 
goods at risk of asbestos contamination. 

Brokers should remind clients who may be importing these types of goods, of their obligation to 
ensure their goods are asbestos free.  While Customs and Border Protection makes every effort 
to clear goods as quickly as possible after their arrival, importers should also be aware that 
there may be delays in releasing goods suspected of asbestos contamination. 

Where goods arriving at the border are suspected of containing asbestos, they may be 
detained.  Importers may be required to arrange and pay for the inspection of the goods by an 
independent, suitably qualified occupational hygienist.  The importer is also responsible for 
arranging for the removal of the item for testing purposes, storage, and (if required), removal 
and disposal of the asbestos.  As it is an offence to import goods containing asbestos without a 
permit, they may be seized as prohibited imports and the importer prosecuted. 

While many importers have contracts with overseas suppliers that stipulate their goods must be 
asbestos free, experience indicates that certification by overseas manufacturers or suppliers is 
not always reliable when determining whether the goods comply with Australian law. 

To assist with facilitating the clearance of their goods, importers may therefore wish to arrange 
for inspection and certification of their goods as asbestos free, by an independent and 
appropriately qualified occupational hygienist, before the goods are exported to Australia.   

For additional information regarding Customs and Border Protection import requirements, 
please refer to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service website 
www.customs.gov.au or contact the Customs Information and Support Centre on 1300 363 263.  
Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to the Director, Community Protection on (02)

NO. 2010/50 

Changes to Regulation 4F and Schedule 6 of the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956  

Regulation 4F and Schedule 6 (firearms and related goods) of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) 
Regulations 1956 (the Regulations) were amended on 16 November 2010 to: 

• 

• 

• 

replace all instances of the word ‘replica’ with ‘imitation’ (for consistency 
with State and Territory legislation); 

clarify the discretionary nature of the power to grant import permission.  The Attorney-
General may, but is not obliged to, give permission to import even where specified 
conditions are met; 

streamline existing arrangements so that exporters who take their firearms overseas for 
legitimate reasons can obtain permission to re-import them upon their return to 
Australia, providing they meet established criteria; 

•  prescribe the form for applying for permission to import firearms and related goods 

(known as Attorney-General’s permits); and 

• 

retitle the ‘Police Authorisation test’ to the ‘Police Certification test’. The amendment is 
intended to clarify that the police do not ‘authorise’ an importation, but rather certify that 
a person is permitted to possess and or use a firearm in that State or Territory. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to the Supervisor Firearms and Weapons on 
telephone number (02) 6245 5478 or fax number (02) 6275 6699.

This Notice summarises tariff and statistical code changes that will occur on 1 January 2011. 

Reduction of duty rates under Free Trade Agreements 

Schedules 5 and 7 of the Customs Tariff Working Pages specify reduced duty rates for certain 
US and Chilean originating goods, including footwear from the US and Chilean grapes.  These 
phasing rates apply to goods entered for home consumption on or after 1 January 2011. 

The Integrated Cargo System will apply these duty rates automatically from 1 January 2011.

Customs and Border Protection will publish the Supplementary Page for Schedule 1, listing the 
ASEAN Member States and the dates for which the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-
Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA) entered into force for those Member 
States.  This page will advise that AANZFTA will enter into force on 1 January 2011 for Laos 
and on 4 January 2011 for Cambodia. 

Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice 2010/52 provides further details on the entry 
into force of AANZFTA for Laos and Cambodia.

The ABS will make corresponding changes to the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity 
Classification.  Australian Customs Border Protection Notice 2010/53 refers. 

In subheadings where statistical codes have changed, some existing statistical codes will cease

ADDITIONAL SUBTANCES ADDED TO SCHEDULE 4 TO THE 

CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED IMPORTS) REGULATIONS 1956 

Regulation 5 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the PI Regulations) 
controls the import of drugs that are listed in Schedule 4 to the Regulations.  A valid 
licence and permit are required to import these substances. 

The Regulations have been amended by adding 14 substances to Schedule 4.  These 
substances are: 
•  classified as controlled drugs or prohibited substances under the Standard for 

Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons (SUSDP), an instrument made under the 
Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, or  

•  controlled under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 or the Convention on 
Psychotropic Substances 1971, and were not previously listed in Schedule 4 to the 
Regulations.   

The additional substances added to Schedule 4 are: 
•  Acetylcodeine; 
•  Acetylmorphine; 
•  Alkoxyamphetamines; 
•  Alkoxyphenylethylamines; 
•  Alkylthioamphetamines; 
•  Amineptine; 
•  5-(2-aminopropyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene 
•  Benzylpiperazine; 
•  1-(8-Bromobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]difuran-4-yl)-2-aminopropane; 
•  Codeine-N-oxide; 
•  Dimethylamphetamine; 
•  Oripavine; 
•  4-methylmethcathinone; 
•  Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine. 

The listing of these substances in Schedule 4, means they are now part of the import 
control regime governed by Regulation 5 of the PI Regulations. 

The PI Regulations have also been amended by moving ketamine from Schedule 8 to 
Schedule 4. This movement of ketamine from Schedule 8 of the Regulations to 
Schedule 4 ensures that Schedule 4 aligns with the SUSDP.

Introduction of Product Stewardship Requirements for 
Computers and Televisions 

This notice is to inform importers and Customs brokers about the development of 
Commonwealth legislation that will require commercial importers of televisions and computers 
to organise and fund the collection and recycling of television and computer waste.  

The National Waste Policy: Less waste, more resources, sets the agenda for national action 
on waste and resource recovery. A key element is industry taking responsibility for the 
collection and recycling of television and computer waste (at the end of the product’s useful 
life), through product stewardship Schemes. These Schemes are expected to commence in 
late 2011. 

Under the proposed arrangements, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will 
provide data to the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and 
Communities (DSEWPaC), to support the operation of the Schemes. 

The product stewardship legislation is being developed by DSEWPaC.  A consultation paper 
on the design of the television and computer Schemes will be released for public consultation 
in early 2011. Information on design of the legislation and Schemes is available at:  
www.environment.gov.au/settlements/waste/product-stewardship/consulation/index.html  

Further information can be obtained from the DSEWPaC on (02) 6274 2179, or via email at 
ewaste@environment.gov.au  Interested parties should subscribe to the National Television 
and Computer Scheme e-bulletin:

Customs and Border Protection advises that 11 Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs) have expired 
because of the operation of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (the Legislative Instruments 
Act). 

Customs and Border Protection was operating on the basis that sunsetting or expiry of 
legislative instruments, which includes TCOs, would not occur under the Legislative Instruments 
Act before 1 April 2015 (10 years and 3 months after the commencement of that Act).  Customs 
and Border Protection recently received advice that this was not the case and a small number of 
TCOs are affected.  The relevant expiry dates range from 1 October 2006 to 1 April 2010.  The 
effect of a TCO expiring under the Legislative Instruments Act is equivalent to the revocation of 
the TCO.  The relevant TCOs and expiry dates are listed below.

Industry consultation on the Customs Amendment (Export 
Controls and Other Measures) Bill 2011 

The Government’s response to the Independent Review of Airport Security and Policing for the 
Government of Australia (the Wheeler Report) included a joint Department of Infrastructure and 
Transport and Customs and Border Protection review of the legal provisions and administrative 
framework of licensed depots and warehouses and Regulated Air Cargo Agents. 

The Minister for Home Affairs has agreed to the release of exposure draft legislation, which 
would implement the outcomes of that review as well as responding to recommendations made 
in the ANAO report ‘Customs’ Cargo Management Re-engineering Project.  The proposed 
legislation would amend the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Act 
1997 to increase primarily the level of security in the air cargo environment.  

The Government is seeking feedback and comments on the exposure draft legislation.  You can 
access the draft legislation and associated explanatory document on the Customs and Border 
Protection website www.customs.gov.au. 

The closing date for submissions on the draft legislation is Wednesday 2 March 2011. 

You may provide submissions by: 

•  email to traderevenuepolicy@customs.gov.au, or 
•  post to 

Trade Revenue and Indirect Tax Policy Section 
6th floor Customs House 
5 Constitution Avenue 
Canberra ACT  2601 

While you may lodge submissions electronically or by post, electronic lodgement in 
Word format is preferred. 

Customs and Border protection will treat submissions as public documents, and it may publish 
them on the Australian Customs and Border Protection website, unless the author expressly 
states that they would like all or part of the submission to remain in confidence.  Legal

2011/05 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – February 2011 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December Quarter 2010 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 25 January 2011.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the rates 
of customs and excise duties on certain spirits, beer and tobacco will increase on  
1 February 2011.  This Notice sets out the new rates in tables 1 to 6. 

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, that is, the December Quarter 2010 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
December 2010 index number (174.0) has been divided by the June 2010 index number (172.1) 
to establish an indexation factor of 1.011.  As this factor is more than one, rates of customs and 
excise duty are increased by the application of this factor. 

Customs and Border Protection has arranged for the publication of a Notice of Substituted 
Rates of Customs Duty (Notice (No. 1) 2011) in Commonwealth Gazette GN 4 on Wednesday 
2 February 2011.

Introduction into Parliament of the Customs Amendment 
(Export Controls and Other Measures) Bill 2011 

The Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Brendan O’Connor MP, introduced the Customs 
Amendment (Export Controls and Other Measures) Bill 2011 into Parliament on 23 March 2011.  
The measures in the Bill form part of the Australian Government’s initiatives to increase the 
level of security in ports, airports and cargo storage facilities. 

The Bill amends the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Act 1997. 

The Bill’s primary focus is to strengthen Customs and Border Protection controls over export 
cargo.  The Bill will enhance Customs and Border Protection’s ability to respond to specific 
security concerns and to detect and respond to high-risk export cargo.  

The Bill implements the outcomes of a joint Department of Infrastructure and Transport and 
Customs and Border Protection review of the legal provisions and administrative framework of 
licensed depots and warehouses and Regulated Air Cargo Agents, and it responds to 
recommendations made in the ANAO report ‘Customs’ Cargo Management Re-engineering 
Project’.

House website at http://www.aph.gov.au/bills/index.htm.

NOTICE NO. 2011/12 

2012 Harmonized System Changes 

The Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Brendan O’Connor MP, introduced the Customs Tariff 
Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2011 into Parliament on 23 March 2011.  The 
Bill contains approximately 800 amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that will implement the 
changes resulting from the World Customs Organization fourth review of the International 
Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly referred to 
as the Harmonized System. 

The Bill will preserve existing levels of industry protection and margins of tariff preference that apply 
to imported goods, including goods imported under Australia’s free trade agreements. 

The Harmonized System is a hierarchical system that uniquely identifies all traded goods and 
commodities.  Since 1988 the Harmonized System has formed the basis of Australia’s commodity 
classifications for traded goods, both imports and exports.  Most countries in the world use the 
Harmonized System and Australia has implemented the Harmonized System domestically through 
the Customs Tariff Act for imports and the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification 
(AHECC) for exports. 

The administering body, the World Customs Organization, reviews the Harmonized System every 
five years to reflect changes in industry practice, technological developments and changes in 
international trade patterns.  As a signatory to the Harmonized System, Australia is required to 
implement the changes resulting from the fourth review on 1 January 2012.   

The fourth review amendments concentrate primarily on environmental and social issues that are of 
global concern.  This includes the use of the Harmonized System to identify goods that are of 
importance to the food security programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations.  It also includes the creation of new subheadings for specific chemicals, which will facilitate 
the monitoring and control of international trade in these products under the Rotterdam Convention 
on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in 
International Trade and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. 

Explanatory documents 

A concordance of tariff items affected by the proposed changes to the Customs Tariff is available 
from the 2012 Harmonized System changes information page on the Customs and Border Protection 
website at: 

http://www.customs.gov.au/tariff/hs2012.asp 

You should read this concordance in conjunction with the Bill and the Explanatory Memorandum 
tabled in the Parliament on 23 March 2011.  You can also find information about progress of the Bill

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2011-13.pdf,Processing imported goods and passengers arriving from Japan,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE  
NO. 2011/13 

Processing imported goods and passengers  
arriving from Japan 

This notice is being issued in response to requests for further information following the recent 
earthquake and tsunami in Japan. In particular, questions have been raised about potential 
risks associated with passengers and cargo arriving from Japan. 

The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) and the Australian 
Government Department of Health and Ageing are closely monitoring and assessing the 
situation, including the potential exposure to radiation of people and goods travelling from Japan 
to Australia. 

Passenger processing 

ARPANSA and the Chief Medical Officer have advised Customs and Border Protection that 
Australians returning from Japan are highly unlikely to be contaminated or to have been 
exposed to significant levels of radiation, and the risks to health are very low. This includes 
passengers arriving on commercial aircraft, cruise ships, and in other small craft. 

In addition, the risk of any contamination being ‘transferred’ from passengers returning from 
Japan to other people (such as in crowded baggage or arrival halls, or while checking in for 
connecting flights or during baggage handling processes) are negligible. 

Accordingly, no checks for radioactivity are required. 

International mail, sea and air cargo and aircraft 

The Japanese Government, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and ARPANSA 
have advised that there is a small chance goods from the Fukushima region and an isolated 
area near Onagawa have been exposed to very low levels of radiation. 

However, the risk to health of people handling mail, containers or cargo arriving from these 
areas is assessed as very low. This includes cars, machinery and parts imported from Japan, 
and other ‘permeable’ goods such as leatherwear, textiles or other goods made from other plant 
or animal material.   

The risk is also very low when boarding vessels (including aircraft) for clearance or 
loading/unloading purposes (for example, when clearing small craft, or unloading bulk goods 
from container ships or commercial aircraft). 

Accordingly, at this point in time it is not considered necessary to introduce any 
radiation screening measures for mail, sea or air cargo, or aircraft arriving from Japan.  
This is consistent with the approach being taken in a number of other countries, such as the UK, 
Canada and New Zealand.

Processing maritime cargo vessels arriving from Japan 

This notice is being issued in response to requests for further information following the 
recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan.  In particular, questions have been raised 
about potential risks associated with radiological contamination of maritime vessels 
arriving from Japan. 

The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) and the 
Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing are closely monitoring and 
assessing the situation, including the potential exposure to radiation of people, goods, 
fresh produce and vessels travelling from Japan to Australia. 

Australian Customs Notice 2011/13 provides information on the current situation with 
respect to processing international mail, sea and air cargo, and aircraft, and is available 
at:   

http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/ACN2011-
13_processing_goods_and_passengers_from_Japan.pdf 

At this point in time it is not considered necessary to introduce any radiation screening 
measures for mail, sea or air cargo, or aircraft arriving from Japan.   

However, as a precautionary measure, FSANZ has requested that the Australian 
Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) tests certain fresh or frozen foods 
originating from the Japanese prefectures of Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Chiba and 
Tochigi. These foods will be referred to AQIS for testing.  Foods that pass testing will 
be released; foods that fail must be re-exported or destroyed.  

Maritime vessels arriving from Japan 

Recent media articles have reported that various international container shipping lines 
have restricted or barred their ships from calling on ports in Tokyo Bay and Yokohama 
because of concerns about radiation from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power 
plant.   

There have also been reports of a Japanese container ship being turned away from 
China due to the detection of high levels of radiation, and the scanning and checking of 
vessels from Japan, by authorities in the USA. 

The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism is monitoring 
radiation levels at the Tokyo, Yokahama, Kawasaki and Chiba ports. ARPANSA and 
other national and international bodies are also independently assessing 
measurements taken across Japan, on a regular basis.

The Treasury has released draft regulations for public consultation to give effect to existing 
administrative arrangements that support the sealed bag scheme for off airport duty free sales 
and to increase the flexibility of the Tourist Refund Scheme. 

The draft regulations include changes to the Customs Regulations 1926, the Excise Regulations 
1925 and the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Regulations 1999. 

The changes provide new export verification procedures under the Sealed Bag Scheme for 
liquids, aerosols, gels, creams and pastes (commonly referred to as LAGs) where such goods 
are purchased duty free from an off-airport retailer.  The new procedures will better match 
international security restrictions that have been in place since March 2007. 

Key changes under the Tourist Refund Scheme amendments include extending the eligibility 
period in which to claim a refund.  The amendment will allow international passengers to 
purchase eligible goods up to sixty days before their departure - an increase from the existing 
thirty-day period.  International passengers will also be able to aggregate multiple invoices from 
single retailers to meet the minimum threshold of $300 (GST inclusive).  

The sealed bag scheme changes also extend eligibility period from thirty to sixty days to match 
the Tourist Refund Scheme changes.   

The draft regulations and explanatory material are available on the Treasury website at  

http://www.treasury.gov.au/contentitem.asp?NavId=037&ContentID=2001 

You can provide written submissions to the Treasury.  The closing date for submissions is 
Friday 29 April 2011.  We encourage interested parties to address the industry questionnaire

NOTICE NO. 2011/17 

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 2011-2012 

In early June 2011, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will contact cheese 
quota holders as part of its work on quota allocations for 2011-2012. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the actual use of quota by 
that importer in the 23-month period ending 31 May 2011, as shown in Customs’ records of 
Import Declarations lodged between 01 July 2009 and 31 May 2011. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the 
quota allocated, importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese 
or curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of 
that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian 
goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, 
preference circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), quota cannot be used.  

The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a) 
(b) 

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs; and   
the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port 
or airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged. 

If an importer does not meet these conditions by the end of the particular financial year to 
which the quota relates, the goods are ‘entered for home consumption’ 

• 

• 

under quota for the following financial year (if the importer has sufficient quota for that 
year), or 
without concession at the rate of Customs duty applicable to the relevant subheading 
of Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act.   

Please note that: 

• 

• 

The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer 
during the 23-month period or that remains unused at 31 May 2011. 

Quota used during the month of June 2010 will be taken into consideration for allocation 
2012-2013, but will NOT count in computations for 2013-2014.  This June ‘factor’ is 
repetitive for every annual allocation because of the 31 May import performance cut-off 
for calculation of following years’ allocations. 

At this time of the year, quota users and their brokers should take stock of quota balances with 
a view to maximising usage and consequently maximising their next allocation. 

We will publish the final allocation in the Commonwealth of Australia: Tariff Concessions 
Gazette in July 2011.

NOTICE NO. 2011/18 

Intention to revoke certain Tariff Concession Orders following 
review 

On 11 May 2011, a delegate of the CEO of Customs and Border Protection published a Notice 
in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette: Tariff Concessions indicating an intention to revoke 
22 Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs) under subsection 269SD (1AA) of the Customs Act. 

The delegate believes the TCOs may provide access to duty concessions for goods that is 
broader than permitted by the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Regulations 1926.   
Specifically, the TCOs may provide concessional entry for some goods to which a TCO must 
not extend because of paragraph 269SJ(1)(b) of the Customs Act, paragraph 185(1)(b) of the 
Customs Regulations, and relevant items of Schedule 2 of the Customs Regulations (commonly 
described as the Excluded Goods Schedule). 

The delegate believes three TCOs are invalid because they apply only to goods listed on the 
Excluded Goods Schedule.  The delegate believes that a further 19 TCOs are sufficiently 
ambiguous that a person could construe the description of the goods in the TCOs as extending 
to goods on the Excluded Goods Schedule.  A complete list of the inconsistent TCOs (described 
as Category A TCOs) and the ambiguous TCOs (described as Category B TCOs) is attached.   

Following publication of the delegate’s intention to revoke certain TCOs in the Commonwealth 
of Australia Gazette: Tariff Concessions, we invite any person affected by the revocation to 
provide a written submission by 8 June 2011 concerning the proposed revocation.   Within 60 
days, the delegate will decide, having regard to any submissions made and any other relevant 
matters, whether he or she is satisfied that the TCOs should be revoked.  If revocation occurs, 
then the operative date of the revocation would be 27 April 2011. 

Please note that the legislation does not permit the automatic making of narrower replacement 
TCOs in these circumstances.  If importers wish to apply for a narrower TCO, then they must 
apply in the usual way using the B443 form. 

In-transit provisions  

In-transit provisions will not apply if the delegate revokes TCOs listed in Category A. 

In-transit provisions, as allowed under subsection 269SG of the Customs Act, will apply if the 
delegate revokes TCOs listed in Category B, provided the goods do not contravene the 
Excluded Goods Schedule. 

Recovery of duty 

Customs and Border Protection will not seek recovery of any duty foregone under the Category 
A TCOs unless there is evidence that the person who received the concession did so through 
inappropriate conduct such as fraud or was aware that the goods for which they received the 
concession should not have been covered by the TCO.

NOTICE NO. 2011/20 

Proposed statistical code changes to the Customs Tariff  

On 13th May 2011, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released an information paper 
regarding proposed changes to a number of statistical codes in the Customs Tariff.  These changes 
will apply from 1 January 2012.   

HS2012 Statistical Code Changes 

The information paper outlines the statistical code changes to the Customs Tariff resulting from the 
World Customs Organization fourth review of the International Convention on the Harmonized 
Commodity Description and Coding System.  It provides a comparative view of the existing and 
proposed 2012 hierarchical structure of the Customs Tariff by chapter, and a correspondence 
between the 2007 and 2012 versions of the Customs Tariff at the 10-digit level.  The changes to 
statistical codes that relate to the HS2012 changes are for advice only and are not subject to 
consultation. 

ABS Review of Statistical Codes  

The paper also provides information on changes that result from a review of statistical codes 
undertaken by the ABS to ensure that the codes remain relevant to the needs of a wide range of 
users.  Clients may provide feedback on the proposed statistical code changes or draft 
correspondences that result from this review. 

The following ABS website contains detailed information on how to make submissions on the 
changes:

Harmonized Export Commodity Codes (AHECC) - particularly with regard to statistical code 
changes.  You can find information about the AHECC changes at the following web address:

New Customs laws 

Last week Parliament passed the following Bills, which are now awaiting Royal Assent: 

•  Customs Amendment (Export Controls and Other Measures) Bill 2011  
•  Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2011, and  
•  Customs Tariff Amendment (Taxation of Alternative Fuels) Bill 2011. 

Customs Amendment (Export Controls and Other Measures) Bill 2011 
Commences on a date to be fixed by Proclamation or within 6 months of the Bill receiving Royal 
Assent 

The measures in the Bill form part of the Australian Government’s initiatives to increase the 
level of security in ports, airports and cargo storage facilities.  The Bill amends the 
Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Act 1997. 

The Bill’s primary focus is to strengthen Customs and Border Protection controls over export 
cargo.  The Bill will enhance Customs and Border Protection’s ability to respond to specific 
security concerns and to detect and respond to high-risk export cargo. 

The Bill implements the outcomes of a joint Department of Infrastructure and Transport and 
Customs and Border Protection review of the legal provisions and administrative framework of 
licensed depots and warehouses and Regulated Air Cargo Agents, and it responds to 
recommendations made in the Australian National Audit Office report ‘Customs’ Cargo 
Management Re-engineering Project’. 

Customs and Border Protection will consult industry, as it develops supporting material to 
implement the measures in the Bill.  This includes changes to the Infringement Notice 
Guidelines for new offences contained in the Bill.

Director, Trade Revenue and Indirect Tax Policy, 02 6275 5999 

Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2011 
Commences 1 January 2012 

The Bill contains approximately 800 amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that will 
implement changes resulting from the World Customs Organization fourth review of the 
International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, 
commonly referred to as the Harmonized System. 

The Bill will preserve existing levels of industry protection and margins of tariff preference that 
apply to imported goods, including goods imported under Australia’s free trade agreements.  

The administering body, the World Customs Organization, reviews the Harmonized System 
every five years to reflect changes in industry practice, technological developments and

Amendment to the Customs Act 1901 

Last week Parliament passed the Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011, 
which is now awaiting Royal Assent. 

Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011 
Commences on a date to be fixed by Proclamation or within 6 months of the Bill receiving Royal 
Assent. 

The amendments will allow, with the consent of the detainee, an initial non-medical internal 
scan of a person to be carried out by a Customs and Border Protection officer using body scan 
technology that is to be prescribed in the regulations. This technology produces a computer 
image of a person’s internal cavities within a skeletal structure, as opposed to images of 
external body parts.   

Such images may serve to allay an officer’s suspicion that a passenger is internally concealing 
a suspicious substance, in which case the detainee would be released immediately from 
detention for internal search.  Where, however, a body scan image supports a suspicion of an 
internal concealment, the existing regime governing internal searches by a medical practitioner 
will apply.  

The Bill’s primary focus is to enable the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to 
exercise its border responsibilities more efficiently and effectively.

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme - Allocations for 2011-2012  

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service advises that it has determined  
2011-12 allocations under the Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme that it administers on behalf 
of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.  Customs and Border Protection 
previously published the allocation attached to this notice in the Commonwealth of Australia 
Gazette - Tariff Concessions No. 2010/27 of 6 July 2011. 

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in 
the 23-month period ending 31 May 2011, as shown in Customs’ records of clearances for 
home consumption.  This calculation excludes any part of the quota that transferred to 
another importer during the 23-month period or that was unused as at 31 May 2011.   

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota 
allocated, importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or 
curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that 
year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian goods), 
or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, preference 
circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement, quota is unable to be used.  

The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a)      an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs, and  
(b)      the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port   
          or airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged. 

Quota allocations are transferable between importers.  A person may apply to transfer quota 
entitlements by completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) 
available at www.customs.gov.au.  The website also contains a Fact Sheet about the Cheese 
and Curd Quota.

2011/28 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – August 2011 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June Quarter 2011 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 27 July 2011.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the rates 
of customs and excise duties on certain spirits, beer and tobacco will increase on  
1 August 2011.  This Notice sets out the new rates in tables 1 to 6. 

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, that is, the June Quarter 2011 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
June 2011 index number (178.3) has been divided by the December 2010 index number (174.0) 
to establish an indexation factor of 1.025.  As this factor is more than one, rates of customs and 
excise duty are increased by the application of this factor. 

Customs and Border Protection has arranged for the publication of a Notice of Substituted 
Rates of Customs Duty (Notice (No. 2) 2011) in Commonwealth Gazette GN 30 on Wednesday 
3 August 2011.

Exposure Drafts – Clean Energy and Alternative Fuels Legislation 

Clean Energy 

The Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, the Hon Wayne Swan MP, and the Minister for 
Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the Hon Greg Combet AM MP, released on 
28 July 2011 exposure drafts of the key bills in the Government’s Clean Energy Legislative 
Package.  The Prime Minister announced the Government’s plan to tackle climate change for a 
clean energy future earlier in July. 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Clean Energy) Bill 2011 is one of those bills.  Along with the 
Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment (Clean Energy) Bill 2011, the Tariff Amendment (Clean 
Energy) Bill 2011 would impose an effective carbon price on aviation and non-transport 
gaseous fuels through customs and excise tariffs.  The Customs Tariff Amendment (Clean 
Energy) Bill 2011 also contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that will link 
alterations to rates of duty in the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to the relevant customs tariff 
subheadings. 

You can find the Clean Energy Legislative Package (exposure draft legislation and explanatory 
material) on the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency website at: 

http://climatechange.gov.au/government/submissions/clean-energy-legislative-
package.aspx 

You can provide written submissions to the Department of Climate Change and Energy 
Efficiency on the draft legislation before 22 August 2011. 

Alternative Fuels 

On 29 June 2011, the Taxation of Alternative Fuels legislation package received Royal Assent. 
The legislation is available on the ComLaw website. The legislation will apply from 
1 December 2011.  To support the legislation, changes to regulations are also required.  

On 2 August 2011, the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon Bill Shorten MP, announced the release of 
exposure draft regulations and associated explanatory statements for public consultation. 

The Customs Amendment Regulations for Alternative Fuels (LPG, LNG and CNG) will amend 
the Customs Regulations 1926 to provide for remission of customs duty for LPG and LNG 
where those fuels are for use other than in an internal combustion engine in a motor vehicle or 
vessel.  The regulations also make other minor consequential changes resulting from the 
imposition of customs duty on certain alternative fuels by the Customs Tariff Amendment 
(Taxation of Alternative Fuels) Act 2011.  These changes will replicate the excise treatment 
provided for equivalent Australian produced fuels.

NO. 2011/33 

Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade 
Agreement – changes to Product Specific Rules 

The  Australia-New  Zealand  Closer  Economic  Trade  Agreement  (ANZCERTA)  has  been  in 
force  since  1983.    The  agreement  addresses  a  range  of  issues,  including  Tariffs,  Rules  of 
Origin (ROO) and Quarantine Harmonisation. 

Annex G of ANZCERTA contains product specific rules (PSR), which determine the eligibility 
of goods not wholly obtained or produced for preferential tariff treatment.  Such rules prevent 
the  benefits  of  trade  agreement  tariff  commitments  extending  to  goods  produced  or 
manufactured in countries other than Australia and New Zealand. 

In negotiating ROO, both countries agreed to include in ANZCERTA a provision requiring the 
review  of  ROO  within  three  years  of  the  new  rules  taking  effect.    The  ROO  took  effect  on 
1 January 2007. 

In  late  2008,  Australian  and  New  Zealand  officials  commenced  a  review  of  those  ROO  and 
completed it in March 2010 resulting in an agreement to amend the text of ANZCERTA Article 
3 (Rules of Origin) and the related Product Specific Rules in Annex G. 

The  new  PSR  are  contained  in  the  Customs  (New  Zealand  Rules  of  Origin)  Amendment 
Regulations 2011 and can be viewed via the following link: 

http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011L01593 

These changes will take effect from 1 September 2011. 

Changes to ANZCERTA Article 3, outlining non-qualifying operations, are currently before the 
Parliament.    A  further  Australian  Customs  and  Border  Protection  Notice  will  be  issued  when 
the legislative process has completed. 

Inquiries concerning this notice may be directed to origin@customs.gov.au, or to the Valuation 
and Origin Section on telephone number (02) 6275 6556.

NO. 2011/38 

Consultation on the Product Stewardship (Computers and 
Televisions) Regulations  

This notice is to update importers and inform Customs brokers about the development 
of Commonwealth regulations that will require importers of televisions and computers 
to organise and fund the recycling of television and computer waste.  

The Product Stewardship Act 2011 commenced on 8 August 2011. The objectives of 
the Product Stewardship Act are to reduce the impact that certain products (and 
substances they contain) have on the environment, and on the health and safety of 
human beings, throughout the entire life of those products.  The first products to be 
covered by product stewardship arrangements are televisions, computers and 
computer peripherals.  

The Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities 
(DSEWPaC) is drafting Product Stewardship (Television and Computer) Regulations 
(the Regulations) to underpin industry run and funded recycling schemes for 
televisions, computers and computer peripherals.  

The Regulations will require that importers of more than a specified number of units are 
liable parties under the Product Stewardship Act, which will then require them to join an 
‘approved product stewardship arrangement’. An approved product stewardship 
arrangement is a set of activities designed to achieve the outcomes (such as a 
recycling target) set out in the Regulations.  Administrators of approved stewardship 
arrangements must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the outcomes specified in 
the Regulations are met, including recycling targets, and Australia-wide coverage.    

Under the proposed Regulations, the Australian Customs and Border Protection 
Service will provide data to DSEWPaC, to support the operation of the Regulations.  
This information will be used to identify importers of televisions, computers and 
computer peripherals, and to determine their liability under legislation.  The Product 
Stewardship Act provides for financial penalties to be imposed in importers who do 
not meet their obligations under the scheme. 

An exposure draft of the Regulations will be released in September 2011 for a four 
week public consultation period. During this period, written submissions will be invited, 
and public meetings will be held nationally between 13 September and 21 September 
2011. Information on meeting dates and locations can be found at:

NO. 2011/ 40 

Processing imported goods and passengers arriving from 
Japan  -  update 

Australian Customs and Border Protection Notices 2011/13 of 25 March 2011 and 2011/15 of 5 
April 2011 outlined processing requirements for passengers, cargo and maritime vessels 
arriving from Japan in the wake of the tsunami and nuclear emergency in March 2011. 

The Australian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) has provided updated advice, 
including some revised requirements for maritime vessels, and information on the selective 
screening of some cargo. 

 Maritime vessels and cargo arriving from Japan  

ARPANSA has advised Customs and Border Protection that measured radiation levels at most 
Japanese ports are now close to typical levels of background radiation and contamination of 
vessels and goods at these ports is not expected. Further information on measured doses at 
ports is available from  www.mlit.go.jp/en/index.html or the International Maritime Organization 
at www.imo.org.  

The Japanese Government and industry have established processes for monitoring of goods 
exported from Japan. The radiation protection criteria used for this contamination screening is 
consistent with Australian and international guidance. ARPANSA continues to advise that it is 
not considered necessary to introduce any comprehensive radiation screening measures for 
mail, sea or air cargo, or aircraft arriving from Japan. This is consistent with the approach being 
taken in a number of other countries, such as the UK, Canada and New Zealand. When 
considered appropriate, ARPANSA will undertake selective screening to provide reassurance of 
the effectiveness of existing protective measures and arrangements. 

Exclusion and Cautionary Zones  

As a precautionary measure, ARPANSA and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) 
have reminded shipping lines that both the exclusion zone and cautionary zone promulgated by 
the Japanese Government should also be applied to ships transiting the area. Vessels should 
not transit within 11 Nautical miles (20km) radius of the Fukushima nuclear power plant (37-19N 
141-01E), and avoid transiting within 16 nautical miles (30km). Mariners are advised that the 
cautionary zone recommendation should be considered a minimum distance, and that prudent 
route planning should incorporate prevailing and changing wind and weather conditions, in 
addition to other precautionary measures.  

The exclusion zone should be observed until further notice, and vessels should note any 
NAVAREA warnings and advice.  

In the event a vessel bound for an Australian port transits through the 16 nautical miles (30km) 
cautionary or exclusion zones, it is requested the vessel’s master submit transit information,

NO. 2011/42 

Closure of the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme 

The Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme (ACIS) is a government assistance program 
for the automotive industry, administered by AusIndustry Division of the Department of Innovation, 
Industry, Science and Research.  While the scheme ended on 31 December 2010 the ACIS 
Administration Act 1999 (ACIS Act) provides participants with a further twelve months in which to apply 
ACIS credits against duty payable, or paid, on eligible imported goods. 

ACIS participants are therefore reminded that all ACIS credits expire on 31 December 2011 and that no 
further application to use credits after this date will be accepted by Customs and Border Protection. 

Until 31 December 2011, importers with ACIS credits can continue to apply them to offset duty, or 
receive a refund of duty already paid, on imported goods where those goods meet the eligibility 
requirements of Item 41E of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995.  The ACIS Act directs that the 
credits will have no value after this date. 

Any remaining unused credit balance will be removed in the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) from          
1 January 2012.  From that date, regulation 126(1)(z) of the Customs Regulations 1926 (Customs 
Regulations) will also no longer be a valid reason for seeking to claim a refund of customs duty. 

Where ACIS credits were applied on an import declaration before 31 December 2011 and an 
amendment to that declaration is required after 31 December 2011, importers are advised to contact 
Customs and Border Protection (details listed below).  As these import declarations quote instruments 
that are no longer valid under legislation, any proposed amendment will need to be handled on a case 
by case basis. 

Where the amendment of the declaration is being sought for a refund of duty, other than under 
regulation 126(1)(z) that was previously offset by the use of ACIS credits, importers will be able to 
continue to rely upon subsection 163(3) of the Customs Act 1901 as to the amount of that refund.  
Where a relevant refund circumstance and the conditions set out in the Customs Regulations are met, 
an importer will be eligible to receive a cash refund of the amount of duty previously offset by the use of 
ACIS credits. 

The Government announced in November 2008 that the assistance provided under ACIS would be 
transitioned to a better targeted, greener program known as the Automotive Transformation Scheme 
(ATS) which is scheduled to run for ten years.  This scheme commenced on 1 January 2011.  
AusIndustry administer the scheme and provide cash payments directly to ATS participants; Customs 
and Border Protection has no involvement in ATS.  Further information on ATS can be found at the 
AusIndustry website:  

http://www.ausindustry.gov.au/Manufacturing/ATS/Pages/AutomotiveTransformationScheme(ATS).aspx  

If you require further information on how Customs and Border Protection will administer the finalisation 
of ACIS credits please contact the Manager, Trade Revenue and Indirect Tax Policy on 02 6275 6551

NO. 2011/45 

Exposure draft – deferred settlement of excise duty and 
excise-equivalent customs duty 

The Treasury has released draft legislation for public consultation.  The draft Bills amend the 
Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 arrangements for deferred settlement of excise duty 
and excise equivalent customs duty.   

The draft legislation is intended to provide businesses with greater flexibility in managing the 
settlement of excise and excise-equivalent customs duties.   

Eligible small business entities will be able to apply for a permission to defer their settlement of 
excise and excise equivalent customs duties to a monthly reporting cycle rather than the 
existing standard seven day arrangement.   

The draft legislation will also allow eligible producers of goods prescribed by regulations to 
apply for a permission to defer their settlement of excise and excise-equivalent customs duties 
to a monthly cycle.  The regulations are designed to ensure that existing monthly settlement 
arrangements for producers of certain petroleum products remain unchanged.   

All businesses operating under the existing standard seven day settlement period, beginning 
Monday and ending Sunday, will be able to apply for a new weekly period, to begin on their 
preferred day.  If a business’ permission relates to gaseous fuel, the proposed changes will 
allow that business to give the Collector a return, on or before the sixth business day following 
the end of each 7 day period. 

A copy of the draft legislation and explanatory material are available on the Treasury website at 
http://www.treasury.gov.au/content/consultations.asp?ContentID=1013&titl=Reviews,%20Inquiri

Exposure draft – Customs Amendment Regulations 

The Minister for Home Affairs has agreed to the release of draft Customs Amendment 
Regulations for industry comment.  The proposed Amendment Regulations can be found on the 
Customs and Border Protection website at www.customs.gov.au under the legislation 
consultation link on the homepage.

You may provide submissions by email to traderevenuepolicy@customs.gov.au 

Parliament passed the Customs Amendment (Export Controls and Other Measures) Act 2011 
(the Export Controls Act) earlier this year.  The proposed Amendment Regulations would make 
three changes as part of the process of implementing the Export Controls Act and would also 
make two other minor amendments.  

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

The Export Controls Act inserts a new circumstance in section 30 of the Customs 
Act 1901 (the Customs Act) at paragraph 30(1)(e) establishing customs control over 
goods that are in prescribed places for export and that are no longer for export.    
Regulation 23 of the Customs Regulations 1926 (the Customs 
Regulations) specifies certain places as prescribed places for the reception or 
manufacture of goods for export for the purposes of paragraph 30(1)(d) of the 
Customs Act.  The Amendment Regulations propose to add the new circumstance 
to regulation 23. 

The Amendment Regulations propose to replace the current arrangements under 
regulation 51 of the Customs Regulations with new arrangements for calculating the 
amount of a refund when a warehouse licence is cancelled including cancellation 
on the request of a licence holder, taking into account whether the licence fee was 
paid for a full year or a part year and whether the payment was by instalment. 

The Export Controls Act added and amended a number of provisions under the 
Customs Act to enable other laws of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory to 
be prescribed for certain purposes.  These purposes include applying conditions to 
depot and warehouse licences including duty free stores and giving directions in 
relation to goods for export.  The amendment Regulations propose to prescribe the 
Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 for these purposes. 

Subregulation 128(2) of the Customs Regulations requires that the goods for which 
a refund application is made must be goods covered by the same import 
declaration or self-assessed clearance document.  The Amendment Regulations 
propose to clarify that this requirement also applies to returns under subsections 
69(5), 70(7) or 105(2) of the Customs Act.

NOTICE NO. 2011/47 

Taxation of alternative (gaseous) fuels and changes relating to gasoline and 
diesel – effective from 1 December 2011 and 1 January 2012 

Two legislative measures will affect the treatment of alternative (gaseous) fuels, and gasoline and 
diesel fuels, in the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff), from 1 December 2011 and 1 
January 2012. 

On 1 December 2011, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Taxation of Alternative Fuels) Act 2011 (Act 
No. 65 of 2011) will impose duties of customs on gaseous fuels - liquefied natural gas (LNG), 
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and compressed natural gas (CNG). 

This Act also creates new subheadings to specify blends of gasoline and ethanol and diesel and 
ethanol, with consequential amendments to the classification of petroleum gasoline and diesel fuels 
in the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff).  ACBPN 2011/22 and 2011/31 refer. 

On 1 January 2012, the Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Act 2011 
(Act No. 85 of 2011) will make further changes to the Customs Tariff that will impact on provisions 
relating to petroleum fuels, particularly light oils and preparations and biodiesel.  ACBPN 2011/12 
refers.  Customs and Border Protection will issue a further Notice in the near future concerning the 
Harmonized System changes. 

Amendments operative from 1 December 2011 - duty rates for gaseous fuels 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Taxation of Alternative Fuels) Act 2011 (the Alternative Fuels Act) 
amends the Customs Tariff to impose customs duties on LNG, LPG and CNG used for transport 
purposes, with effect from 1 December 2011.  The legislation also provides for increases in these 
rates of duty each July until 1 July 2015.  Table 1 lists these rates of duty.

Release of the new Customs Tariff Working Pages for the HS2012 Harmonized 
System Changes 

Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice No. 2011/12 advised that the Minister for Home 
Affairs, the Hon Brendan O’Connor MP, introduced the Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 
Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2011 into Parliament on 23 March 2011.  This Bill received Royal 
Assent on 26 July 2011 as the Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) 
Act 2011 (Act No. 85 of 2011). 

The Act contains approximately 800 amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs 
Tariff) that will implement the changes resulting from the World Customs Organization fourth review 
of the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, 
commonly referred to as the Harmonized System or HS.  These changes are due to take effect on 
1 January 2012 (HS2012). 

Customs Tariff Working Pages 

Customs and Border Protection has finalised the amendments to its publication titled “Combined 
Australian Customs Tariff Nomenclature and Statistical Classification” (commonly referred to as the 
Tariff Working Pages) to reflect the changes to the Customs Tariff to apply from 1 January 2012.  A 
complete set of these Working Pages accompanies this ACN.  Please note the following: 

•  For Schedules 5, 6, 7 and 8, that provide rates of duty for goods covered by Australia’s Free 
Trade Agreements, only those pages that contain HS2012 related changes have been 
reprinted. 

•  For a number of items in Schedules 5, 7 and 8, it has been necessary to prescribe certain 
goods for duty purposes.  These prescribed goods will be set out in the Customs Tariff 
Regulations 2004.  Customs and Border Protection will arrange for the amendment of these 
Regulations and will issue further reprint pages to incorporate the text of the Regulations, as 
required. 

The Tariff Working Pages for the HS2012 changes will be available on the Customs and Border 
Protection website, from 31 October 2011, at: 

www.customs.gov.au then select working tariff 2012. 

Please note that the changes in these pages will not commence until 1 January 2012.  The working 
tariff 2007 contains the current (until 31 December 2011) Tariff Working Pages. 

Explanatory documents, including a concordance of tariff items affected by the changes to the 
Customs Tariff by the HS2012 legislation and an Explanatory Memorandum are available on the 
Customs and Border Protection web page under Quick links.  The concordance should be read in 
conjunction with the HS2012 Act and the Explanatory memorandum.

Industry advice on changes to the Infringement Notice Scheme
and Infringement Notice Scheme Guidelines

On 28 November 2011 the  Customs Amendment (Export Controls and Other Measures)
Act 2011 (the Act) came into effect.

The Acts primary focus is to strengthen controls over export cargo, enhancing Customs
and Border Protection's ability to respond to specific security concerns and to detect and
respond to high-risk export cargo.

The amended INS Guidelines (2010) now incorporate the new offences.

As with previous introductions of new offences with associated penalties under the INS, a
six-month 'administrative moratorium' will be in place until 31 May 2012.

Consequently, there will be no infringement notice action in relation to breaches of
offences against 77R(1), 77Y(4). 82C(1) or 112D(2), until 1 June 2012.

It should be noted however that as 77R(1) and 77Y(4) are existing offences, prosecution
action may result from breaches despite the moratorium period being in effect.

New Strict Liability offences under the INS

Subsections 82C(1): requires that the holder of a warehouse licence must not
breach a licence condition(s).

Subsection 112D(2): it is an offence if a person refuses or fails to comply with a
written direction in relation to goods for export.

Existing offences now included as Strict Liability offences under the INS

Subsection 77R(1): the holder of a depot licence must not breach a condition of
their licence

Subsection 77Y(4): it is an offence if a person refuses or fails to comply with a
written direction given in relation to goods in a licensed depot.

Applicable Penalties

The applicable penalty for the new strict liability offences under the INS is 10 penalty units
($1100.00).

Australian Customs and Border Protection Notices Nos. 2011/12 and 2011/50 provide advice on 
amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff) contained in the Customs Tariff 
Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Act 2011 (HS2012 Act).  Those amendments reflect 
changes arising out of the fourth review by the World Customs Organization (WCO) of the International 
Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System.  These changes (the HS2012 
changes) will enter into force on 1 January 2012. 

This Notice provides further advice on changes to Customs’ instruments and decisions, that result from the 
HS2012 changes, including Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs), Tariff Precedents and Tariff Advices (TAs).  

This Notice also provides information on other changes to the Customs Tariff that will take effect on 
1 January 2012. 

Tariff Concession Orders 

Customs and Border Protection has completed a review of Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs) affected by the 
HS2012 changes.  Attachment A provides a concordance of TCOs to be revoked and replaced with one or 
more new TCOs under the appropriate HS2012 tariff classifications, with effect from 1 January 2012. 

The Tariff Concessions Gazette of 4 January 2012 will advise of the revocation of the HS2012 affected 
TCOs.  It will also advise the replacement TCOs. 

Tariff Precedents  

Customs and Border Protection has reviewed existing Tariff Precedents and identified ten precedents that 
are HS2012 affected.  These precedents will be altered after 1 January 2012 as per the table at 
Attachment B.  

Tariff Advices  

In December 2011, Customs and Border Protection will void approximately 940 Tariff Advices (TAs) 
affected by the HS2012 changes.   

Customs and Border Protection will notify importers by mail before 15 December 2011 regarding TAs to be 
voided.  Importers who wish to seek a new TA to replace a voided TA will need to submit new applications 
through TAPIN on or after 1 January 2012. 

TAPIN will reject TA applications submitted before 1 January 2012 that refer to new tariff classifications 
operative from that date.  Importers should review new Tariff Precedents before applying for new TAs.  A 
list of the tariff classifications from which TAs will be voided is at Attachment C for information.

2011/58 

Movement of goods under Customs control that has not been fully 
reported – revised 5 December 20111 

Purpose: 

The purpose of this notice is to: 

• 

increase awareness and emphasise the importance of timely and accurate reporting; and 

•  advise that Customs and Border Protection will be undertaking additional activities to closely 

monitor cargo that has not been reported within legislated timeframes. 

Background 

Customs and Border Protection applies an intelligence-led, risk based approach to protect Australia’s 
border. This means that we facilitate legitimate trade and travel and reduce risk to the border by 
focusing our resources where they are needed most. Our approach draws on early and accurate 
reporting by industry, strategic and operational intelligence and assurance programs and campaigns 
designed to detect, deter and disrupt illicit activity. 

Accurate and timely lodgement of cargo reports and import declarations - or other relevant declarations 
such as the Self Assessed Clearance (SAC), are critical in enabling Customs and Border Protection to 
complete risk assessment and intervention activities before cargo moves into the Australian community.  

Legislated cargo reporting and declaration lodgement timeframes (set out at Attachment A) are 
designed to provide Customs and Border Protection with the information needed to promptly undertake 
risk assessment and to identify requirements for further intervention once the goods have arrived into 
Australia. 

Key elements of this information include: 

(cid:1)  all related cargo reports for each consignment; so that the details of participants in the supply 
chain and ultimate consignor and consignees are available prior to the arrival of goods at the 
first Australian Port; and 

(cid:1)  all import declarations; providing advice about the identity of the importer, suppliers, and 
commodities, lodged by the end of the next working day of Customs, following the day on 
which the goods were imported into Australia. 

Timely and accurate reporting of cargo facilitates risk assessment to be undertaken: 

• 

• 

in the case of sea cargo, prior to the goods moving from the port of destination (either to 
licensed premises or into home consumption); and 
in the case of air cargo, shortly after arrival at the intended place of deconsolidation. 

1 This ACN was first published on 2 December 2011.  It was revised on 5 December 2011 to include a 
column of legislative references in Attachment A.

NO. 2011/62 

HS2012 PRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES OF ORIGIN FOR 
FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS 

On 1 January 2012, some of the classifications in the Customs Tariff Act 1995 
will change as a result of amendments to the Harmonized Commodity 
Description and Coding System (HS2012 changes).  Detailed information 
regarding the changes is available in Australian Customs and Border Protection 
Notices 2011/12, 2011/20 and 2011/50 which are available on the Customs and 
Border Protection web page at http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page4408.asp 

These changes affect some of the Rules of Origin in the following free trade 
agreements (FTAs): 

●  Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement; 
●  Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement; 
●  Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement; 
●  Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA); 
●  Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement; and 
●  ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement. 

The Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement still employs Rules of Origin based 
on HS2002.  Consequently, Australian Customs Notice 2006/66 remains 
unchanged and should be referred to for guidance if importers wish to claim 
preferential duty under TAFTA.   

Australian officials and officials representing our FTA partners are currently 
discussing the finalization and implementation of the conversion to HS2012 of  the 
product-specific rules of origin (PSRs) for the above FTAs.  Further Customs 
Notices will be issued advising when the HS2012 PSR will be implemented for 
each of the FTAs. 

Pending further advice, Certificates of Origin (COO) and self-certification of origin 
for goods imported into Australia, where required under specific FTAs, may 
continue to be issued by the issuing bodies or the exporters/producers in the FTA 
partner countries under HS2007.  In cases where the COO or the self-certification 
has been issued using HS2007, when completing the Customs Declaration for 
importing the goods into Australia the importer will need to ensure that the goods 
are classified using HS2012.

Release of an Exposure Draft of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Schedule 4) 
Bill 2012 

The Government has approved the release of an Exposure Draft of the Customs Tariff Amendment 
(Schedule 4) Bill 2012 for general comment. 

This follows a review of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff) by the Better 
Regulation Ministerial Partnership (the Partnership) between the Minister for Finance and 
Deregulation, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, and the Minister for Home 
Affairs. 

Tariff concessions are provided through Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff for a range of imported 
goods under different circumstances.  The review of Schedule 4 by the Partnership has focussed on 
removing unnecessary complexity from the Schedule by simplifying existing arrangements and 
removing obsolete items.  When enacted, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Schedule 4) Bill 2012 
would implement the recommendations of the Partnership. 

The Exposure Draft and supporting documentation are available on the Customs and Border 
Protection website at:

2012/02 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – February 2012 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December Quarter 2011 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 25 January 2012.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the rates 
of customs and excise duties on certain spirits, beer and tobacco will increase on  
1 February 2012.  This Notice sets out the new rates in tables 1 to 6. 

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, that is, the December Quarter 2011 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
December 2011 index number (179.4) has been divided by the June 2011 index number (178.3) 
to establish an indexation factor of 1.006.  As this factor is more than one, rates of customs and 
excise duty are increased by the application of this factor. 

Customs and Border Protection has arranged for the publication of a Notice of Substituted 
Rates of Customs Duty (Notice (No. 1) 2012) in the Commonwealth Gazette on Wednesday 
8 February 2012.

Australian Customs  and
Border  Protection  Serwice

New Autonomous Sanctions Laws

The  Australian Government has expanded existing  laws to impose  autonomous  sanctions
against  foreign governments and individuals  in situations of internaiional concern. These
laws restrici or prevent  the export of certain  goods  to certain people,  entities  and places.
For example,  they  restrict  export of arms  or related  mat6riel  to foreign governments
committing human  rights  abuses against  their  own people.

Autonomous  sanctions  are not sanctions imposed  by United Nations  Security  Council
Resolutions,  though  they may  support  and  supplement  those resolutaons.

Until  recently,  Australia's autonomous sanctions  were implemented under  a range  of
separate  legal  instruments. On 27 May 2011  lhe Autonomous  Sanctions  Act 2077  (the Act)
commenced, providing  a new  legislative  framework  to create, administer  and  enforce
Australia's  autonomous  sanctions.  In effect,  the Act consolidates  a range  of sanctions
legislation and  also widens the range  of punitive  measures  that  the Australian  Government
can implement  as a matter  of foreign policy. fhe  Autonomous Sanclions Regulations  2011
were subsequently  enacted on 15 December  201 1  .

Customs  and Border  Protection  contributes  to Australia's  sanction  efforts  through  the
administration and  enforcement of Customs  Regulations.  Customs  and  Border  Protection
has amended  the  Cusforns  (Prohibited  Exports) Regulations  7958  to give  effect  to the
Autonomous  Sancflons  Regulations 2011 . New  Division  2A makes  it prohibited  to export
goods subject  to autonomous sanctions unless the Minister  for Foreign  Affairs  has given
oermission.

The new  regulations  within Division  2A are as follows:

Regulation  11 - prohibits the exportation  of export sanctioned  goods  to countries  listed in
subregulation 4(2)  of the Autonomous  Sancfions  Regulations 2011  or designated under sub
regulation  4 (3) of those regulations;

Regulation  1 1A - prohibits  the exportation  of goods to designated  persons  and entities
listed  at paragraph  6(1  ) (a) or 2(a)  of the Autonomous  Sancflons  Regulations 2011; and

Regulation  11B - prohibits the exportation of controlled assets,  where controlled assets  are
defined as assets belonging to a person or entity listed as paragraph  6(1) (a) or 2(a) of the
Autonomous  Sanctions  Regulations 201  1 .

Therefore,  trade that  contravenes  these  regulations is an offence  and carries  penalties for
individuals of imprisonment for not more  than  10 years, or a fine  not exceeding three  times
the value of the goods  or $275 000, whichever is the greater, or both. Penalties  for bodies
corporate are a fine not exceeding three  times  the value of the goods or $1 100 000
whichever  is the oreater.

Importation of goods containing cat or dog fur. 

This Notice has been issued to remind importers and their agents of the import control that 
applies to cat and dog fur and to products made from that fur. 

The importation of domestic cat fur (the pelt or hair of an animal of the species Felis catus) and 
domestic dog fur (the pelt or hair of an animal of the species Canis familiaris) and cat or dog fur 
products without permission is prohibited under Regulation 4W of the Customs (Prohibited 
Imports) Regulations 1956. 

Applications for import or export permissions should be addressed to: 

National Manager 
Trade Branch 
Australian Customs and Border Protection Service 
5 Constitution Avenue 
Canberra ACT 2601 

Recently, there have been allegations that goods containing dog fur have been imported in 
contravention of the control. If such goods were imported without the necessary permission, 
they would be prohibited imports and liable to seizure. The importation of a prohibited import is 
also an offence under the Customs Act 1901 that may attract a maximum penalty of $110,000. 

Importers are reminded that they bear the responsibility for ensuring that imported goods 
comply with legislative requirements. Care should be taken when sourcing imported products 
that the goods comply with Australian law. 

Customs and Border Protection will be increasing its surveillance of imported clothing and 
footwear products in 2012 to ensure compliance with the control.  If any fur products are

Australia - New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade 
Agreement – Rules of Origin requirements 

This notice seeks to clarify current rules of origin requirements under the Australia – 
New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA). 

On 1 January 2012, the factory cost rule of origin under Subdivision G of Division 1E 
of the Customs Act 1901 was repealed.  Australia Customs Notice No. 2006/64 refers.  
This means that, for goods imported into Australia on or after 1 January 2012, 
importers can no longer use Preference Rule Type “P50” to claim Preference Scheme 
Type “NZ” in the Integrated Cargo System (ICS).   

To qualify for ANZCERTA preferential tariff treatment, imported goods must meet one 
of the current origin criteria to be considered as New Zealand originating:  

•  Goods are wholly obtained in New Zealand, or New Zealand and Australia, 
such as minerals extracted there, plants grown there, or products obtained 
from such plants; 

•  Goods produced entirely in New Zealand, or New Zealand and Australia, 

exclusively from originating goods only; 

•  Goods wholly manufactured in New Zealand from one or more of the following: 

o  unmanufactured raw products; 
o  materials wholly manufactured in Australia or New Zealand or Australia 

and New Zealand; or  

o  determined manufactured raw materials; or 

•  Goods produced entirely in New Zealand, or New Zealand and Australia, from 

non-originating materials only, or from non-originating materials and 
originating materials. Under this criteria, the non-originating materials must 
meet the requirements of product specific rules as listed in the Customs (New 
Zealand Rules of Origin) Amendment Regulations 2011.  

Detailed explanation of each criteria and other applicable requirements, such as the 
consignment provision, can be found in the relevant instructions and guidelines on 
ANZCERTA, available at:

NO. 2012/09  

Processing imported goods and passengers arriving from 
Japan  -  update 

Australian Customs and Border Protection Notices 2011/40 of 17 October 2011 outlined 
processing requirements for passengers, cargo and maritime vessels arriving from Japan in the 
wake of the tsunami and nuclear emergency in March 2011. 

The Australian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) has provided updated advice 
on some revised requirements for maritime vessels and the monitoring of vessels for 
contamination.  

Current Situation 

In December 2011, the Japanese Government announced that all reactors at the Fukushima 
Dai-ichi site are in cold shutdown. This significantly reduces the likelihood of uncontrolled 
release of radiological material into the environment. 

Radioactive contamination from previous releases is still present in the immediate vicinity of the 
Fukushima site. The Japanese Government has measures in place to monitor releases of 
radioactive material into the marine environment. A 20 km maritime restricted area remains in 
place.  

Maritime vessels and cargo arriving from Japan  

ARPANSA has advised Customs and Border Protection that measured radiation levels at most 
Japanese ports are now close to typical levels of background radiation and contamination of 
vessels and goods at these ports is not expected. Further information on measured doses at 
ports is available from  www.mlit.go.jp/en/index.html or the International Maritime Organization 
at www.imo.org.  

ARPANSA continues to advise that it is not considered necessary to introduce any 
comprehensive radiation screening measures for mail, sea or air cargo, or aircraft arriving from 
Japan. This is consistent with the approach being taken in a number of other countries.  

Restricted Maritime Area   

Vessels should avoid transiting within the 10.8 nautical miles (20 kilometre) restricted area of 
the Fukushima nuclear power plant (37-19N 141-01E).  Mariners are advised that the 
cautionary zone recommendation should be considered a minimum distance, and that prudent 
route planning should incorporate prevailing and changing wind and weather conditions, in 
addition to other precautionary measures.

NOTICE NO. 2012/10 

Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2012 - Alterations to the Customs 
Tariff - Listing of Serbia as a Developing Country 

Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2012 was tabled in Parliament on 16 February 2012.  The Proposal 
contains an alteration to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff) to list Serbia as a 
Developing Country for the purposes of the Australian System of Tariff Preferences (ASTP). 

The listing of Serbia in Part 4 of Schedule 1 of the Customs Tariff (Developing Countries Subject to 
DCS Rates of Duty) will provide it with Developing Country status for the purposes of the ASTP and 
accord it a reduction in customs duty on a defined range of goods imported into Australia. 

This alteration will take effect on 1 March 2012 and will apply to goods imported from Serbia for home 
consumption on or after that date. 

The Proposal also contains alterations that were previously given effect through the publication of 
Customs Tariff Notices in the Commonwealth Gazette, during December 2011, to: 

•  extend the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement (Textile, 
Clothing and Footwear Provisions) Scheme (the SPARTECA - TCF Scheme) to 2014 - 
Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice No. 2011/65 refers; and 

• 

re-insert subheading 5308.10.00 applicable to coir yarn, with effect from 1 January 2012.  This 
subheading was incorrectly omitted in the Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized 
System Changes) Act 2011. 

Tariff Working Page Schedule 1/3 (R.9) to reflect the listing of Serbia will be available in the week 
commencing 27 February 2012.  Customs Tariff reprint pages relating to the SPARTECA-TCF 
Scheme were issued in January 2012.

Amendment to the Notice of Rates of Exchange 

Customs and Border Protection directly uploads exchange rates (received from the Reserve 
Bank of Australia) into the Integrated Cargo System (ICS). On a weekly basis, the exchange 
rates are also published as an administrative instrument via a Commonwealth Gazette Notice 
and made available on the Customs and Border Protection website. 

Recently, an administrative error resulted in the publication of incorrect exchange rates for the 
period 28/12/2011 to 03/01/2012, in the Gazette Notice GN 1 of 11 January 2012.The rates 
uploaded into the ICS for the period were unaffected by the error. 

Customs and Border Protection has issued an amended administrative instrument to correct the 
error. This administrative instrument contains the correct exchange rates for the period 
28/12/2011 to 03/01/2012. 

As noted above, the exchange rates uploaded into the ICS for the period remain correct, so all 
import declarations lodged in the ICS using exchange rates for the period noted remain correct 
and unaffected.

SECTION 77G DEPOTS PROVIDING CARGO TERMINAL OPERATOR 
SERVICES FROM OFF-AIRPORT SITES 

Purpose 

The purpose of this document is to clarify current application processes and reporting 
requirements in place to manage off-airport Cargo Terminal Operator (CTO) Services.  

For the purposes of this notice, off-airport CTO services are those activities provided 
on behalf of an airline in accordance with the terms of a contract, which include the 
specific legislated responsibilities of report, breakdown, check-in, approved movement 
of uncleared cargo (underbond) and acquittal of imported cargo at a licensed place 
outside of the airport precinct.  

Other services such as ramp, refuelling and baggage handling, which are generally 
provided by on-airport CTO service providers, are not regarded as relevant when 
considering the merits of an application to provide CTO services from an off-airport 
depot.     

Background 

As physical space constraints and increasing cargo volumes in the airport precincts 
become more of an issue for the airfreight industry, stakeholders are exploring options 
that would allow cargo to move directly from aircraft to off-airport licensed facilities, 
whilst maintaining legislated border management requirements. 

Both on-airport CTO service providers and off-airport depot operators are licensed to 
provide specific cargo handling services in accordance with section 77G of the 
Customs Act 1901 (the Act).  

Some on-airport CTOs already have additional off-airport premises (licensed under 
Customs legislation) for freight staging, short term storage and related activities. 

The approved movement of cargo from an on-airport CTO to all off-airport licensed 
depots is provided under section 71E of the Act.  This movement is managed by an 
Underbond Movement Request (UBMR), which must be lodged electronically in the 
Integrated Cargo System (ICS).  Where space constraints restrict the ability to unpack 
at the on-airport premises, licensed operators are able to seek permission to move 
cargo underbond to the off-airport premises for unpack and outturn.  To ensure secure 
movement of cargo in this scenario, additional conditions may be added to the depot 
licences of both on-airport and off-airport sites. 

This process ensures that the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service 
(Customs and Border Protection) maintains knowledge and records of cargo 
movements, being at all times aware of cargo location and can therefore intercept 
cargo for further inspection and examination as required. 

Adherence to this process ensures a nationally consistent approach to legislated 
reporting and control requirements.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2012-20.pdf,Proposed amendment to the production assist costs provisions of the Customs Act 1901,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 
NO. 2012/20 

Proposed amendment to the production assist costs provisions 
of the Customs Act 1901 

Customs and Border Protection proposes to amend the definition of production assist costs in 
section 154(1) of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act) to ensure that the legislation is 
consistent with the World Trade Organization (WTO) Valuation Agreement. 

Division 2 of Part VIII of the Customs Act sets out provisions for the valuation of imported 
goods. This gives effect to Australia’s obligations under the WTO Valuation Agreement.      

The valuation provisions require that production assist costs, where relevant, be included in 
determining the customs value of imported goods.  

Customs and Border Protection has found that the production assist cost provisions in the 
current legislation may not completely align with the WTO Valuation Agreement.  

The amendment will affect the ‘purchaser’s material costs’, ‘purchaser’s subsidiary costs’, 
‘purchaser’s tooling costs’ and ‘purchaser’s work costs’ definitions in section 154(1) of the 
Customs Act.  

The policy intent of the proposed changes to these definitions is to correctly reflect Article 
8(1)(b)(i)-(iv) of the WTO Valuation Agreement.  Article 8(1)(b)(i)-(iv) requires the customs value 
of imported goods to include the value, apportioned as appropriate, of the materials, design 
work, parts or tools where supplied directly or indirectly by the buyer free of charge or at 
reduced cost for use in connection with the production of the imported goods. 

The definitions in section 154(1) of the Customs Act require the actual cost of acquisition of the 
material to be included in the customs value of the imported goods.  In circumstances where the 
materials, parts or tools were provided free of charge by the buyer to the seller in the import 
sales transaction and such material was acquired free of charge or at reduced cost by the buyer 
from an unrelated person, the cost of acquisition is treated as zero under the legislation.  

This is contrary to the intention of Article 8(1)(b)(i)-(iv) which is to attribute a reasonable value to 
the material supplied directly or indirectly by the buyer for use in the production of imported 
goods and to include that value in the customs value despite the fact that the buyer acquired the 
material from a third party at zero cost or reduced cost. 

As part of the legislation development process, Customs and Border Protection invites 
submissions from industry on the proposed legislative amendment outlined above, in particular 
comments regarding:  

• 
• 

impacts on industry; and 
specific business compliance costs for the proposal. 

Feedback received will be taken into consideration in the development of the final proposal for 
legislative amendment.

NOTICE NO. 2012/22 

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 2012-2013 

In early June 2012, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will contact cheese 
quota holders as part of its work on quota allocations for 2012-2013. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the actual use of quota by 
that importer in the 23-month period ending 31 May 2012, as shown in Customs’ records of 
Import Declarations lodged between 01 July 2010 and 31 May 2012. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the 
quota allocated, importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese 
or curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of 
that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian 
goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, 
preference circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), quota cannot be used.  

The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a) 
(b) 

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs; and   
the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port 
or airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged. 

If an importer does not meet these conditions by the end of the particular financial year to 
which the quota relates, the goods are ‘entered for home consumption’ 

• 

• 

under quota for the following financial year (if the importer has sufficient quota for that 
year), or 
without concession at the rate of Customs duty applicable to the relevant subheading 
of Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act.   

Please note that: 

• 

• 

The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer 
during the 23-month period or that remains unused at 31 May 2012. 

Quota used during the month of June 2011 will be taken into consideration for allocation 
2013-2014, but will NOT count in computations for 2014-2015.  This June ‘factor’ is 
repetitive for every annual allocation because of the 31 May import performance cut-off 
for calculation of following years’ allocations. 

At this time of the year, quota users and their brokers should take stock of quota balances with 
a view to maximising usage and consequently maximising their next allocation. 

We will publish the final allocation in the Commonwealth of Australia: Tariff Concessions 
Gazette in July 2012.

Australia - New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade 
Agreement – Rules of Origin – Upcoming Changes 

On 6 March 2012, the Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Act 2012 
(the Amendment Act) received Royal Assent, which implements domestically the 
agreed changes to Article 3 of the Australia – New Zealand Closer Economic 
Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA).  Article 3 sets out the rules of origin 
requirements which determine the eligibility of goods for preferential tariff treatment 
under ANZCERTA.   

The current rules of origin provisions in ANZCERTA entered into force on 1 January 
2007.  In negotiating these rules, both countries agreed to include in ANZCERTA a 
provision requiring the review of the rules of origin within three years of the new rules 
taking effect.  Australia and New Zealand commenced the review in late 2008.  The 
review was completed in March 2010 resulting in an agreement to amend Article 3 of 
ANZCERTA and the related Product Specific Rules in Annex G.  The Annex G 
amendments took effect on 1 September 2011.  Please refer to Australian Customs 
and Border Protection Notice No. 2011/33 for further details.  

Specifically, the Amendment Act contains amendments to Division 1E of Part VIII of the 
Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act) to implement the changes to Article 3, including: 

(a)  a new definition of ‘aquaculture’;  

(b)  amended definition of ‘manufacture’; 

(c) 

amended definition of ‘produce’; 

(d)  amended provisions dealing with ‘wholly obtained goods’; 

(e)  amended provisions dealing with eligibility based on the last process of 

manufacture; 

(f) 

a new section to provide that goods are not New Zealand originating goods 

merely because of certain operations; and 

(g) 

consequential amendments to the verification powers in Division 4D of Part VI of 

the Customs Act. 

Full details of the Amendment Act are available on the ComLaw website, at: 
http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00001. 

The new changes will take effect on the date when the governments of Australia and 
New Zealand notify each other by an exchange of notes that they have completed their

NO. 2012/27 

Australia – United States Free Trade Agreement – Change to 
the Rules of Origin Requirements for Yarn made from Viscose 
Rayon Fibres 

The Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSTFA) entered into 
force on 1 January 2005.  AUSFTA is a bilateral trade agreement designed to 
increase trade liberalisation and facilitate investment between Australia and the 
United States. 

Annex 4-A of AUSFTA contains product specific rules (PSR), which determine 
eligibility for preferential tariff treatment under the AUSFTA for textile and 
apparel goods that are not wholly obtained or produced in Australia or the US.  
These rules prevent the benefits of preferential tariffs extending to goods 
produced or manufactured in countries other than the parties to the agreement. 

The need for the amendment to AUSFTA arose from changes in Australian and 
United States textile industries.  Under the current PSR, yarn made from 
viscose rayon fibres are eligible for preferential tariff treatment if the viscose 
rayon used to produce the yarn were sourced from Australia or the United 
States.  As viscose rayon staple fibres are no longer produced in either country, 
yarn made from viscose rayon fibres is not originating goods under the current 
PSR and therefore not eligible for the benefits under the AUSFTA. 

The amendment will deliver benefits to Australian manufacturers by allowing 
them to access preferential tariff treatment when exporting certain yarns to the 
United States, regardless of the origin of the viscose rayon staple fibres used to 
produce that yarn.   

The amending Regulations replace the existing PSR for tariff headings 5501-
5511 with three new PSRs for goods classified under these same tariff 
headings.  

The PSR for goods classified under tariff heading 5510.90 enables both 
Australia and the US to provide preferential tariff treatment for yarns classified 
to this tariff heading regardless of the country of origin of the viscose rayon 
fibres used to produce that yarn.

Clean Energy and Alternative Fuels Changes for 1 July 2012  

This Notice summarises the changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff) 
resulting from clean energy and alternative fuels legislation, operative 1 July 2012. 

Aviation Fuel  

The Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Act 2011 (Clean Energy (CTA) Act) 
received Royal Assent on 4 December 2011 as Act No. 155 of 2011.  This Act amends 
the Customs Tariff to adjust duty rates for aviation fuel by an amount equivalent to the 
carbon emission price of the fuel.   

Presently the duty applied to aviation fuel is a designated levy to fund the Civil Aviation 
Safety Authority (CASA).  The new legislated rates will include the CASA levy plus an 
aviation fuel carbon component; the CASA component is not affected.  The Act alters 
rates of duty for aviation gasoline and kerosene as set out in the Table below.  The 
adjusted rates of duty apply to the listed subheadings in Schedule 3 and relevant items 
in Schedules 5 to 8 of the Customs Tariff, applicable to Australia’s free trade 
agreements.

The Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Act 2011 amends the Excise 
Tariff Act 1921 to implement corresponding changes to excise rates for locally 
produced aviation fuels. 

New Section 19A 

The Clean Energy (CTA) Act inserts new section 19A in the Customs Tariff to give 
effect to future carbon price adjustments for aviation fuels.  Section 19A will link duty 
rates for aviation fuels to the equivalent items in the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and will 
automatically adjust those duty rates when duty rates change in that Act.  This is 
similar to the mechanism in the present section 19 of the Customs Tariff that links 
changes to customs rates of duty for alcohol and tobacco products to rates of duty in 
the Excise Tariff Act 1921, for the purposes of twice yearly CPI duty rate adjustments.

New Conditions for Depot and Warehouse Licence Holders -
Revised 25 June 20121

The purpose of this Notice is to inform existing Customs depot and warehouse licence holders
of the new conditions of their licence that will come into effect on 1 July 2012.

As a delegate of the Chief Executive Officer. I am imposing additional conditions to all depot
licenses under section 770 of the Customs Act 1901  (the Act) and to all warehouse (including
duty free) licence holders under section 84 of the Act. The new conditions will not apply to
Excise Equivalent Goods warehouses administered by the Australian Taxation Office.

I have attached the new conditions to this Notice. All licence holders will receive a copy of the
conditions in due course.

Failure to meet any conditions(s) of the licence is very serious and constitutes a breach under
section 77R or section 82C of the Act (depots and warehouses respectively). Breaching these
sections of the Act can result in an infringement notice being issued. a prosecution in court,
further conditions being placed on the licence or the cancellation of the licence.

I am of the view that the imposition of these conditions is necessary for the protection of the
revenue and to ensure compliance with the Customs Acts.

Attachment A - Depot Licence Conditions

NO: 2012/36 

Additional Synthetic Greenhouse Gas added to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) 
Regulations 1956 and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 

Under the Australian Government's new Clean Energy Future Plan, Synthetic Greenhouse Gas 
(SGG) listed under the Kyoto Protocol will have an equivalent carbon price applied through the 
existing Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management legislation.  SGG’s 
include hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons (excluding gases produced from aluminium 
smelting) and sulfur hexafluoride, and any equipment or products which contain these gases -. 

Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (PI Regulations) and the Customs (Prohibited 
Exports) Regulations 1958 (PE Regulations) currently prohibit the import and export of certain 
SGGs and ODSs (Ozone Depleting Substances), unless the importer/exporter has a valid 
licence issued by the Department of the Environment (DoE).  The prohibition relates to 
substances listed in Schedule 10 of the PI Regulations and Schedule 15 of the PE Regulations. 

From 1 July 2012, a licence will be required for any imports of bulk SF6 gas and air-conditioning 
and refrigeration equipment containing sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), in line with existing mandatory 
clearance requirements currently applied to ODS in the PI and PE Regulations. SF6  is a new 
substance added to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 
1989. In addition, the existing Pre-Charged Equipment Licence will be changed to refer to either 
ODS Equipment or SGG Equipment Licences. 

Sulfur Hexafluoride or SF6 is an SGG that has been identified as having a high global warming 
potential and is listed in the Kyoto Protocol. 

SF6 is found in a number of other different commodities, including some fire extinguishers, 
certain aerosol products and as an insulating gas in the electricity supply industry. These goods 
are also captured under the licensing arrangements. However, no mandatory border clearance 
measures will be applied on 1 July 2012, pending further identification and assessment of the 
types of products likely to be captured under the new control.  

To assist in identifying the volume and breadth of imported fire and electricity equipment and 
aerosols using SF6, an information only Community Protection question will be required to be 
answered upon lodgement. The answer to this question will not impede the clearance of the 
goods.  Information gained from the results of the question will assist Customs and Border 
Protection and DoE to capture more detailed data on SGG and ODS goods.

Professional Development for Licensed Customs Brokers

Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for Customs Brokers

Following consultation with industry, Customs and Border Protection will introduce a
mandatory CPD scheme for licensed customs brokers from 1 July 2012. Accordingly, I
am imposing the CPD licence condition advised in Australian Customs and Border
Protection Notice 2012/29 on all customs broker licences. This includes all licences
renewed with effect from 1 July 2012 and all new licences issued on or after 1 July
2012.

I am imposing this condition, as I am satisfied that it is necessary and desirable for the
protection of the revenue or ensuring compliance with the Customs Acts.

The finalised CPD scheme is at Attachment A.

Persons or organisations seeking accreditation of CPD activity should submit
details of the proposed activity to National Customs Brokers Licensing
Advisory Committee through brokers.licensing@customs.gov.au .

Further guidance

I provided advice about changes to customs broker licence conditions that will apply
from 1 July 2012 in Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice 2012/29.

In the coming weeks Customs and Border Protection will publish additional guidance
for licence holders to assist them to meet their obligations.

NO. 2012/39 

Amendments to the Customs Tariff in connection with Clean 
Energy Legislation for 1 July 2012 

Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice 2012/34 advised of amendments to 
the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff) resulting from the Clean Energy 
(Customs Tariff Amendment) Act 2011.  Notice 2012/34 also advised of pending 
changes to the Customs Regulations 1926 (Customs Regulations) to provide a partial 
remission of customs duty on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas 
(LPG) for non-transport purposes. 

This Notice, 2012/39, summarises those additional changes that will occur on 
1 July 2012. 

Partial remission/refund for LNG and LPG - 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 

Prior to 1 July 2012, the Customs Regulations provided for the automatic remission, or 
refund, of customs duty for LNG and LPG for non-transport use.  The automatic 
remission is given effect through items 130 and 131 of the Supplementary Provisions of 
the Customs Tariff Working Pages and their associated treatment codes 130 and 131. 

Amendments to the Customs Regulations, effective on 1 July 2012, will provide for a 
partial remission of customs duty on LNG and LPG for non-transport purposes.  The 
partial remission will remit the alternative fuel rate less the applicable carbon rates, 
according to the formula: 

Partial remission  =  fuel tax  less  carbon price 

For LNG (Supplementary Provisions Item 130) 

Partial remission (3.78 cents per kg)  =  fuel tax (10.45 cents per kg)  less  carbon price 
(6.67 cents per kg) 

Consequently, an effective carbon price of 6.67 cents per kilogram (or $0.0667/kg) is 
applied to item 130. 

For LPG (Supplementary Provisions Item 131) 

Partial remission (1.32 cents per litre)  =  fuel tax (5.00 cents per litre)  less  carbon 
price (3.68 cents per litre) 

Consequently, an effective carbon price of 3.68 cents per litre (or $0.0368/L) is applied 
to item 131. 

The new rates apply to LNG and LPG imported from all sources.

2012/42 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – August 2012 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June Quarter 2012 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 25 July 2012.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the rates 
of customs and excise duties on certain spirits, beer and tobacco will increase on  
1 August 2012.  This Notice sets out the new rates in tables 1 to 6. 

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, that is, the June Quarter 2012 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
June 2012 index number (180.4) has been divided by the December 2011 index number (179.4) 
to establish an indexation factor of 1.006.  As this factor is more than one, rates of customs and 
excise duty are increased by the application of this factor. 

Customs and Border Protection has arranged for the publication of a Notice of Substituted 
Rates of Customs Duty (Notice (No. 2) 2012) in the Commonwealth Gazette on Wednesday 
1 August 2012.

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme - Allocations for 2012-2013  

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service advises that it has determined 2012-13 
allocations under the Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme that it administers on behalf of the 
Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.  Customs and Border Protection previously 
published the allocation attached to this notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette - Tariff 
Concessions No. 2010/27 of 4 July 2012. 

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 
23-month period ending 31 May 2012, as shown in Customs’ records of clearances for home 
consumption.  This calculation excludes any part of the quota that transferred to another 
importer during the 23-month period or that was unused as at 31 May 2012.   

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota 
allocated, importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or 
curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that 
year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian goods), 
or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, preference 
circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement, quota is unable to be used.  

The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a) 
(b) 

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs, and   
the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port or 
airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged. 

Quota allocations are transferable between importers.  A person may apply to transfer quota 
entitlements by completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) 
available at www.customs.gov.au.  The website also contains a Fact Sheet about the Cheese 
and Curd Quota.

Excise Equivalent Goods Administration – Release of a public 
discussion paper 

On 1 July 2010, under a previous Better Regulation Ministerial Partnership (Partnership) the 
Government transferred the majority of functions required to administer excise equivalent goods 
(EEGs) from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to the Australian Taxation 
Office (ATO).  This included administration of customs warehouse licences for EEG warehouses 
and administration of warehoused EEGs. 

The Government has announced a new Partnership, between the Minister for Home Affairs, 
The Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Assistant Treasurer to examine options to 
further streamline the legal and administrative framework for EEGs.The Partnership is 
conducting a review and will make recommendations on options to streamline arrangements 
and reduce costs to business.  Options to be examined include:  

• 
• 
• 
• 

• 

• 

transferring EEGs into the excise regime; 
reviewing the point at which excise duty is imposed on imported EEGs; 
consolidating the collection and administration of excise goods and EEGs within the ATO; 
reviewing the control of duty free stores, providores and catering bonds, whilst maintaining 
border integrity and the efficiency and effectiveness of current border controls; 
examining whether the administration of excise goods and EEGs should be consolidated 
under the one administrator; and 
revising the import declaration requirements for EEGs intended to be used in excise 
manufacture. 

The Government has released a discussion paper which outlines the current administrative and 
legislative arrangements governing excisable goods and EEGs, and provides a summary of 
differences in the treatment of these goods. The paper seeks views from industry and 
community stakeholders on further opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of 
the EEGs regime and likely impacts of any proposed reforms. Information that stakeholders 
provide will be used to assist in the development of options for Government consideration. 

The paper, and instructions for making a submission, can be accessed from the Treasury 
website at http://www.treasury.gov.au/ConsultationsandReviews/Submissions/2012/Excise-

Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Measures No.1) Act 2012 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Measures No.1) Act 2012 (the Act) received the 
Royal Assent on 25 September 2012 and contains the following changes:   

1.  Customs Tariff Proposal (No.1) 2012 changes (ACN 2012/10 refers) 

•  Schedule 1 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 lists those countries and places that 
are accorded preferential rates of duty under the Australian System of Tariff 
Preferences.  Serbia has now been listed in Part 4 of Schedule 1 as a 
Developing Country (DCS).  Serbia’s DCS country status took effect on 
1 March 2012. 

•  Subheading 5308.10.00 applies to coir yarn, commonly used in the manufacture 
of mats and rope.  This subheading was incorrectly omitted in the Customs Tariff 
Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Act 2011.  The reinsertion of 
the subheading took effect on 1 January 2012.  

2.  Other changes 

The Harmonized System 2012 changes moved the goods of subheading 5601.10.00 
(sanitary articles of textile wadding) to heading 9619 (sanitary articles).  The Act 
amends the text of subheading 5601.2 to ""Wadding of textile materials and articles 
thereof:” to reflect this change.  The changes to the text for the subheading took effect 
on 25 September 2012. 

Tariff Reprint Pages 

Customs and Border Protection will print and distribute the relevant tariff working 
page 56/3 (R.5) in the week commencing 15 October 2012.  Page 38/3 (R.9) is also

NOTICE NO. 2012/55 

Implementation of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Schedule 4) Act 2012  

Background 

Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff) lists concessional items 
covering goods and user categories in respect of which concessional rates of import duty 
have been granted. Schedule 4 delivers a range of policy objectives, including industry 
assistance and the implementation of tariff concessions arising from international treaties. 

In 2010 a review of Schedule 4 was initiated to simplify the existing tariff concession regime 
by the Better Regulation Ministerial Partnership between the Minister for Finance and 
Deregulation, the then Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, and the 
Minster for Home Affairs. 

This review focussed on removing unnecessary complexity from Schedule 4 by simplifying 
existing arrangements and removing obsolete items. 

The recommendations of the Ministerial Partnership were incorporated in the Customs 
Tariff Amendment (Schedule 4) Bill 2012.  This Bill received the Royal Assent on 
25 September 2012 as Act No. 138 of 2012 (the Schedule 4 Act).   

Previous Australian Customs Notices provided advice about the review (ACN 2010/18) and 
consultation on an exposure draft of the Schedule 4 legislation (ACN 2011/64). 

Commencement 

The Schedule 4 Act will commence on 1 March 2013. 

Application 

The Schedule 4 Act contains an application provision that provides that the amendments in 
the Schedule 4 Act will apply to goods imported into Australia on or after the 
commencement of the Act and also to goods imported before that date where the time for 
working out the rate of import duty on those goods had not yet occurred, including: 

  Goods imported before commencement, but not entered for home consumption until 

after commencement; 

  Goods imported and entered into warehouse before commencement and not 

entered for home consumption until after commencement; and 

  Goods not required to be entered for home consumption, for example 

unaccompanied personal effects.

A refund is only available where the application for refund is for at least 100,000 cigarettes, 100kg of 
tobacco or other tobacco products, or a combination of cigarettes and tobacco or other tobacco products 
weighing at least 100kg. 

Further requirements that need to be met for this refund circumstance are included under amended 
regulation 127 of the Customs Regulations as follows: 

-  Customs and Border Protection is given a notice of the intended destruction of the tobacco or 

tobacco products at least 7 day prior to the goods being destroyed; and 

-  when the notice of the intended destruction is given, the goods are in a warehouse licensed 

under section 79 of the Customs Act 1901 to warehouse excise equivalent goods, in particular 
tobacco and tobacco products; and 

-  Customs and Border Protection is given a reasonable opportunity to supervise the destruction. 

A notification of intended destruction is to be given to Customs and Border Protection on approved form 
B1223 ‘Notice of Intended Destruction – Tobacco Products’. The form is available on the Customs and

DISCLAIMER 

The information provided in this Australian Customs Notice is no longer current and has been 
replaced by Australian Customs Notice No. 2020/44. 

This notice advises of changes to the Customs Regulations 1926 (Customs Regulations) relating to the 
provisions for duty drawback of customs duty on imported, duty paid, tobacco and tobacco products. 
These changes come into effect from 9 November 2013. 

The changes will improve consistency across government for exporters by more closely aligning the 
drawback claim requirements for both customs and excise duty with those used by the Australian 
Taxation Office. 

The changes require owners of tobacco and tobacco products for export to provide Customs and Border 
Protection with notice in writing, in a reasonable time before exportation, of their intention to claim duty 
drawback on the exportation. 

Upon receipt of such a notice, Customs and Border Protection may then require the goods to be 
produced for examination before exportation and/or require the goods to be repackaged according to the 
Regulations. 

The notice must be sent to Customs and Border Protection at the following email address: 
TobaccoDrawbacks@customs.gov.au. The notice is to include the following details: 

-  Owner’s name / Australian Business Number 
-  Product type 
-  Quantities 
-  Expected date of export 
-  Place of export (such as a depot and its location) 
- 

International carrier (such as Australia Post, express courier or international forwarder). 

Duty drawback is not payable on the export of tobacco or tobacco products if either: 

- 

a notice of intention to export is not communicated in a reasonable time before export, 
or 

-  Customs and Border Protection’s notice requiring certain action is not complied with by the 

exporter or their agent.

NO. 2012/65 

Customs Tariff Amendment (Malaysia-Australia Free Trade 
Agreement Implementation) Act 2012 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation) Act 2012 (the Act) contains amendments to the Customs Tariff 
Act 1995 (Customs Tariff) to implement the duty reductions contained in the Malaysia-
Australia Free Trade Agreement (MAFTA). 

The amendments to the Customs Tariff: 

  provide free rates of customs duty for goods that are Malaysian originating goods in 

accordance with new Division 1H of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 (the 
Customs Act).  New Division 1H was inserted in the Customs Act by the Customs 
Amendment (Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation and Other 
Measures) Act 2012; 

  amend Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff to maintain customs duty rates for certain 

Malaysian originating goods in accordance with the applicable concessional item; 
and 

  create a new Schedule 9 in the Customs Tariff to accommodate excise equivalent 

rates of duty. 

The MAFTA amendments come into effect on 1 January 2013.   

The Act also provides that preferential rates for Malaysian originating goods will apply 
to goods imported before 1 January 2013 but entered for home consumption on or after 
that date.  

Malaysia is currently listed as a Developing Country under Division 1 of Part 4 of 
Schedule 1 of the Customs Tariff.  Goods imported from Malaysia are therefore subject 
to DCS rates of duty.  Certain rubber goods from Malaysia are covered by the 
Malaysia-Australia Trade Agreement.  Malaysian goods are also accorded AANZ rates 
of duty under the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA).  
When implemented, MAFTA will not affect these existing preferential arrangements 
with Malaysia.  

Import declaration procedures for goods from Malaysia 

The entry procedures for goods from Malaysia will be as follows: 

  The Country Code ""MY"" should continue to be used for all goods from 

Malaysia.

NOTICE NO. 2012/66 

Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Consequential and 
Transitional) Act 2012 

The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012 (the ACNC Act) establishes a new 
independent statutory office, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) which 
will be the Commonwealth level regulator for the not-for-profit (NFP) sector.  Registration with the 
ACNC will be a precondition where charities seek access to Australian Government exemptions, 
concessions or benefits available to charities.  The ACNC Act received Royal Assent on 
3  December 2012 and commenced on that day. 

To give effect to this policy a range of consequential legislative amendments were required to 
establish the ACNC as the central regulatory body for the NFP sector.  The Australian Charities and 
Not-for-profits Commission (Consequential and Transitional) Act 2012 (the ACNC Consequential and 
Transitional Act) which also commenced on 3 December 2012 contains those amendments. 

This Act, inter alia, amends the Custom Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff) by inserting a definition 
of ‘registered charity’ in Part 1 of the Customs Tariff.  That definition requires that a charity must be 
registered under the ACNC Act as an entity mentioned in column 1 of subsection 25-5(5) of that Act. 

The ACNC Consequential and Transitional Act also amends item 23A of Schedule 4 to the Customs 
Tariff to provide for the duty free entry of goods that have been donated or bequeathed by a person 
or company outside Australia to an organisation established in Australia that is: 

(a)  a registered charity; or 
(b)  a library, museum, gallery or institution, gifts to which are deductible because it is covered by 

item 12.1.2, 12.1.3, 12.1.4, or 12.1.5 of the table in subsection 30-100(1) of the Income Tax 
Assessment Act 1997.

Introduction into Parliament of the Customs Amendment 
(Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2012  

The Minister for Home Affairs, Jason Clare, introduced the Customs Amendment 
(Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2012 into Parliament on 28 November 2012.   

The Bill amends the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) to introduce a new offence for bringing 
into Australia a new category of goods known as ‘restricted goods.’ Restricted goods will be 
prescribed by regulation and would be prohibited imports if they were imported into Australia.   

The Bill also amends the Customs Act, the Import Processing Charges Act 2001 and the A New 
Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 to make a number of technical amendments 
including:  

 

clarifying that self-powered ships and aircraft that are imported or intended to be 
imported are subject to the control of Customs and should be entered for home 
consumption; 

  amending a number of valuation definitions to ensure consistency with the Agreement 
on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 
(World Trade Organization Customs Valuation Agreement); 

  enabling officers of Customs to designate a customs controlled area for both 

passengers and crew, and the CEO to designate a seaport as a customs controlled 
area; 

  allowing the CEO to request further information from an applicant, to address any 

concerns, prior to the grant of a warehouse licence; 

  aligning the treatment of the timeliness of the report of cargo reporters with the cargo 

report; 
repealing the legislation which introduced the accredited client program; 
repealing expired moratorium period for cargo reporting; and 

 
 
  other minor technical amendments.  

The Bill and the Explanatory memorandum are available on the Australian 
Parliament House website on the Bills page.

NO. 2012/69 

Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement – Rules of Origin 

The Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement (MAFTA) was signed on 22 May 2012 in Kuala 
Lumpur, Malaysia.   

MAFTA will enter into force on 1 January 2013.  Upon the entry into force of MAFTA, importers 
will be entitled to duty-free entry for goods imported from Malaysia, provided that the goods 
meet the MAFTA rules of origin requirements.  

This Notice summarises the rules for determining whether a good originates in Malaysia for the 
purposes of MAFTA. 

‘Free’ rates of customs duty 

The Customs Tariff Act 1995, as amended by the Customs Tariff Amendment (Malaysia-
Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Act 2012, will allow the entry of Malaysian 
originating goods free of customs duty from the day that MAFTA enters into force. The 
preferential treatment will apply to Malaysian originating goods that are imported on or after the 
day that MAFTA enters into force, or goods imported before that day and entered for home 
consumption on or after that day. 

Please refer to Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice No. 2012/65 for information on 
amendments to the Customs Tariff and related amendments to import declaration procedures 
for goods imported from Malaysia.  

Other duties and taxes 

While Malaysian originating goods will be eligible for ‘Free’ rates of customs duty, other duties 
and taxes such as excise-equivalent duties, goods and services tax, dumping duties and other 
taxes and levies, including cost recovery charges, if relevant, will still be payable in relation to 
such goods. 

Rules of origin 

Goods will be Malaysian originating goods if they satisfy the requirements of: 

• 

• 

the new Division 1H of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act), as inserted by 
the Customs Amendment (Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation 
and Other Measures) Act 2012; and 

the Customs (Malaysian Rules of Origin ) Regulation 2012 (the MAFTA Regulations). 

Division 1H sets out the rules of origin for the following categories of goods: 

• 

goods that are wholly obtained or produced;

Customs broker obligations – standard letter 

Customs and Border Protection has imposed a number of new conditions on all customs broker 
licences issued on or after 1 July 2012 (Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice 
2012/29 refers). We provided additional guidance to assist customs brokers to meet their 
obligations (Notice 2012/43 refers). 

We ran a series of compliance industry awareness sessions in August 2012 and during those 
sessions, a number of licensed customs brokers requested a standard Customs and Border 
Protection letter that they could use to inform clients and prospective clients about the 
obligations of a customs broker. 

Please find attached a standard letter that customs brokers could provide to clients and 
prospective clients that outlines key aspects of broker licensing under the Customs Act 1901 
and in particular the key obligations of a customs broker.  There is no requirement for a customs 
broker to use this letter.

Border  Pmtection  Service

New Military End Use Law

The Australian Govemment  has recently  introduced  new measures  to strengthen  Australia's
export  controls.

New section  1 12BA  of the Cusloms  Act 7901  (the  Act) provides  the Minister for Defence  with  a
power to prohibit  the export  of otherwise  non-regulated  goods  that  may contribute  to a military
end-use  that  may prejudice  Australia's security,  defence  or international  relations'

In the context  of this new law, goods are or may be for a military  end-use if they  are or may be for
use  in operations, exercises  or other activities  conducted  by an armed  force or an armed  group,
whether  or not the armed  force or armed  group forms part of the armed  forces  of the govemment
of a foreign country. An armed  force or armed  group  may include,  but is not limited  to:

.  Military or Defence Forces;
r  Police forces;
.  Coast  guard;
r  Militant  or insurgent  groups;
o  Private  security  companies;  and
o  Terrorist  or criminal  organisations.

Where  the Minister for Defence  suspects  that a particular  good, if exported,  would  or may  be for  a
military  end-use contrary  to Australia's security  andior national  interest, then  the Minister  may
issue a notice to prohibit  the export. A prohibition  notice will remain  in force  for up to 12 months,
unless  revoked  by the Minister.

Contravention of a prohibition notice is an offence  and attracts a maximum  penalty of 10 years
imprisonment  or 2,500 penalty  units, or both.

The mifitary  end-use  law complements measures introduced in the Defence  Trade  Controls  Act
2012, \Nhi;h  also addresses  other export control matters  including  brokering,  providing  of
services  and  intangible  technology  transfers.

Further

on this new  law can be found  at www.defence.qov.au/dem  or by contacting

2013/03 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – 1 February 2013 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released the December Quarter 2012 Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) figures on 23 January 2013.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff) and section 6A of the Excise Tariff 
Act 1921, the rates of customs and excise duties on certain spirits, beer and tobacco will 
increase on 1 February 2013.  This Notice sets out the new rates in Tables 1 and 2 below. 

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, that is, the December Quarter 2012 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
December 2012 index number (102.0) has been divided by the June 2012 index number (100.4) 
to establish an indexation factor of 1.016.  As this factor is more than one, rates of customs and 
excise duty are increased by the application of this factor. 

The index number of 180.4 (June Quarter 2012), published in ACN 2012/42, has been 
converted to 100.4 as the ABS has reset the index numbers for each index series to 100.0 for 
the financial year 2011-12. 

Note that these rates also apply to goods subject to indexation in Schedule 5 (US originating 
goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), 
Schedule 8 (AANZ originating goods) and Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods) in the 
Customs Tariff. 

Customs and Border Protection has arranged for the publication of a Notice of Substituted 
Rates of Customs Duty (Notice (No. 1) 2013) in the Commonwealth Gazette on 
Wednesday 6 February 2013.

NOTICE NO. 2013/07 

Implementation of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Schedule 4) Act 2012 
Arrangements for Customs By-laws and Other Instruments 

Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice No. 2012/55 advised that amendments to 
Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff), contained in the Customs Tariff 
Amendment (Schedule 4) Act 2012 would commence on 1 March 2013.  That Notice set out 
administrative arrangements, including new treatment codes, reference numbers, statistical codes 
and GST exemption codes, for use with the new Schedule 4 items. 

Further to the above Notice, this Notice provides information on the new standing by-laws and other 
instruments that will also take effect on 1 March 2013, as part of the Schedule 4 implementation. 

General Use (Standing) By-laws 

Standing by-laws are set out in the Schedule of Concessional Instruments Part II (SCI Part II) of the 
Customs Tariff Working Pages.  All standing by-laws linked to Schedule 4 items will be repealed 
from 1 March 2013 and new by-laws will be issued, as required.  In many instances, existing by-laws 
applicable to similar or related goods have been combined.  Where a standing by-law is redundant 
or has had no usage in the last three years, or the parent item is being revoked without replacement, 
a new by-law has not been created. 

Most of the new by-laws have been reworded for clarification.  However, where new by-laws have 
been issued, the scope of the previous by-laws has not changed. 

The Attachment to this Notice is a Correlation Table linking pre -1 March and post -1 March by-laws, 
sorted by the pre -1 March 2013 concessional item number.  For those pre -1 March items and their 
associated by-laws, the Table shows a replacement by-law number, where a new by-law has been 
issued.  The Table also shows those by-laws where a replacement by-law has not been issued. 

Administrative Arrangements 

All existing standing by-laws will cease to operate on and from 1 March 2013.  However, the by-law 
numbers will continue to be available in the Customs and Border Protection Integrated Cargo 
System (ICS) for eligible goods entered in the period of validity of the by-law. 

For goods entered on or after 1 March 2013, it will be necessary to use the appropriate new by-laws, 
with the relevant treatment code or reference number on import declarations. 

Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs) 

The text of item 50 applicable to TCOs has been amended for clarification.  However, TCOs will 
continue to be given effect through item 50 of Schedule 4 by quoting existing TCO numbers and the 
relevant treatment code.

2013/09 

Continuing Professional Development Scheme for Licensed 
Customs Brokers - UPDATE 

The purpose of this notice is to advise licensed customs brokers of the accredited activities that 
are available for the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) scheme and to provide 
additional clarification on certain issues. 

Commencement Date 

As stipulated in Additional Condition 4 of customs brokers licences, the CPD Scheme 
commences on 1 April 2013.  For the purposes of CPD, the CPD year commences on 1 April 
and concludes on 31 March of every year. 

The finalised CPD Scheme as published in Australian Customs on Border Protection Notice 
2012/37 also had two sections titled “When will the CPD obligation commence?” and “How 
much CPD will I have to do in my first year if I am a newly licensed customs broker?”  These 
sections stated the scheme would commence on 1 July, which is incorrect.  We have updated 
the CPD Scheme paper and a new version is at Attachment A. 

Self-Assessment of Activities 

A number of people have suggested that certain participants or training providers should be 
able to 'self-assess' on training issues. Currently, we do not support a self-assessment regime 
because in part we want to ensure consistency in the implementation of CPD. 

Timeliness of Accreditation of Activities 

Organisations or individuals offering CPD activities should ensure that Customs and Border 
Protection has accredited their activity before marketing it as such or it should be clear that they 
are still seeking accreditation for the activity. 

If a presenter is unable to secure accreditation before delivery of the activity, Customs and 
Border Protection will allow accreditation post-delivery of the activity.  Accreditation would only 
be valid for the CPD year in which the activity occurred, unless otherwise specified.  

Exemptions from CPD Obligations 

Customs and Border Protection expects that all customs brokers will comply with the 
requirements of the scheme.  However, we would consider waiving all or part of the 
requirements for a particular year in special or exceptional circumstances such as long periods 
of illness.  The onus would be on the customs broker to put forward a case for waiving all or part 
of the CPD requirements in a particular year.  Customs and Border Protection would consider 
each case on its merits. 

Accredited Activities 

You can download a list of accredited CPD activities from Customs and Border Protection web 
site at the following location http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page6090.asp  The list of 
accredited activities will be updated each time we provide an activity with accreditation.  Please 
note that some organisations do not wish to market accredited activity and therefore they do not 
appear on the website. 

You should direct any comments or queries regarding the CPD Scheme to 
brokers.licensing@customs.gov.au

NO. 2013/12 

New Customs laws to strengthen the supply chain against 
criminal infiltration introduced into Parliament 

On Wednesday 20 March 2013, the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Jason Clare MP, 
introduced the Customs and AusCheck Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other 
Measures) Bill 2013 into Parliament. 

The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) and the AusCheck Act 
2007 to mitigate vulnerabilities at Australia’s borders. The Bill forms the latest part of a package 
of measures to deter and prevent infiltration by serious and organised crime into Australia’s 
seaports, airports and cargo supply chain.  

The proposed measures 

The amendments to the Customs Act seek to strengthen the cargo supply chain against 
criminal infiltration by: 

•  Placing statutory obligations on cargo terminal operators (CTOs) and those that load 

and unload cargo, which are similar to those that the Customs Act imposes on holders 
of depot and warehouse licences.  These obligations include mandatory reporting of 
unlawful activity, ensuring the physical security of relevant premises and cargo, and fit 
and proper person checks on management at Customs and Border Protection’s 
request.  Non-compliance will attract criminal or administrative sanctions. 

•  Creating new offences for using information from the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) to 

aid a criminal organisation. 

•  Providing that the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Customs and Border Protection can 
consider the refusal or cancellation of an ASIC or MSIC when determining whether the 
person is fit and proper under the Customs Act. 

•  Aligning aspects of the customs broker licensing scheme with that of depots and 

warehouses, including providing the CEO of Customs and Border Protection with the 
power to impose new licence conditions at any time and making it an offence to breach 
certain licence conditions. 

•  Adjusting other controls and sanctions in the Custom Act, including increasing penalties 
for certain strict liability offences and the offences in section 234, and improving the 
utility of the infringement notice scheme by for example increasing the relevant 
penalties. 

Industry consultation 

Introduction of the Customs Act measures followed consultation with industry through a range of 
fora.  The Attorney General’s Department (AGD) published several fact sheets on 6 July 2012 
regarding these and other measures. Representatives of AGD, Australian Federal Police, 
Department of Infrastructure and Transport, Australian Crime Commission and Customs and 
Border Protection attended a series of industry consultation meetings.  Customs and Border 
Protection has also engaged separately with industry on various measures including through 
the Customs and Border Protection National Consultative Committee and Compliance Program

NOTICE NO. 2013/13 

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 2013-2014 

In early June 2013, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will contact cheese 
and curd quota holders to discuss quota allocations for 2013-2014. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the actual use of quota by 
that importer in the 23-month period ending 31 May 2013, as shown in Customs’ records of 
Import Declarations lodged between 01 July 2011 and 31 May 2013. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the 
quota allocated, importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese 
or curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of 
that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian 
goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, 
then quota cannot be used.  Similarly, if preference circumstances or Free Trade Agreements 
(FTAs) apply, then quota is not available.  

The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a) 
(b) 

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs; and   
the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port 
or airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged. 

Please note that: 

• 

• 

The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer 
during the 23-month period or that remains unused at 31 May 2013. 

Quota used during the month of June 2012 will be taken into consideration for allocation 
2014-2015, but will NOT count in computations for 2015-2016.  This June ‘factor’ is 
repetitive for every annual allocation because of the 31 May import performance cut-off 
for calculation of following year’s allocations. 

At this time of the year, quota users and their brokers should take stock of quota balances with 
a view to maximising usage and consequently maximising their next allocation. 

We will publish the final allocation in the Commonwealth of Australia: Tariff Concessions 
Gazette in July 2013.

AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 
NO. 2013/16 

Amendment to the production assist costs provisions of the 
Customs Act 1901 

The production assist costs provisions, i.e. the definitions of ‘purchaser’s material costs’, 
‘purchaser’s subsidiary costs’, ‘purchaser’s tooling costs’ and ‘purchaser’s work costs’ in section 
154(1) of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act) have been amended to ensure that the 
legislation is consistent with the World Trade Organization (WTO) Valuation Agreement. 

The above amendments were included in the Customs Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) 
Act 2012 and commenced on 31 March 2013.  

The policy intent underlying the changes to these definitions is to correctly reflect Article 
8(1)(b)(i)-(iv) of the WTO Valuation Agreement.  Article 8(1)(b)(i)-(iv) require the customs value 
of imported goods to include the value, apportioned as appropriate, of the materials, design 
work, parts or tools where supplied directly or indirectly by the buyer free of charge or at 
reduced cost for use in connection with the production and sale for export of the imported 
goods. 

The previous definitions of ‘purchaser’s material costs’, ‘purchaser’s subsidiary costs’, 
‘purchaser’s tooling costs’ and ‘purchaser’s work costs’ in section 154(1) of the Customs Act 
required the actual cost of acquisition of the material to be included in the customs value of the 
imported goods.  In circumstances where the materials, parts or tools were provided free of 
charge by the buyer to the seller in the import sales transaction and such material was acquired 
free of charge or at reduced cost by the buyer, the cost of acquisition was treated as zero. 

This is contrary to the intention of Article 8(1)(b)(i)-(iv) which is to attribute a reasonable value to 
the material supplied directly or indirectly by the buyer for use in the production of imported 
goods and to include that value in the customs value despite the fact that the buyer acquired the 
material from a third party at zero cost or reduced cost.

The Customs Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Act 2013 (Amendment Act) received the 
Royal Assent on 30 March 2013.  

All measures in Parts 2 to 9 of the Amendment Act commenced on the day after Royal Assent.   
The new ‘restricted goods’ offence in Part 1 of the Amendment Act commences on a day to be 
fixed by Proclamation. 

The Amendment Act amends the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act), the Import Processing 
Charges Act 2001 and the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 to make a 
number of technical amendments.  The Amendment Act: 

 

clarifies that self-powered ships and aircraft that are imported or intended to be 
imported are subject to the control of Customs and should be entered for home 
consumption; 

  amends a number of valuation definitions to ensure consistency with the Agreement on 
Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 
(World Trade Organization Customs Valuation Agreement); 

  enables officers of Customs to designate a customs controlled area for both passengers 

and crew, and the CEO to designate a seaport as a customs controlled area; 
  allows the CEO to request further information from an applicant, to address any 

concerns, prior to the grant of a warehouse licence; 

  aligns the treatment of the timeliness of the report of cargo reporters with the cargo 

report; 
repeals the legislation which introduced the accredited client program; 
repeals expired moratorium period for cargo reporting; and 
repeals a redundant definition and corrects a minor numbering error.

Amended Valuation - Transfer Pricing Policy Practice 
Statement 

Customs and Border Protection has recently published the amended Valuation -
Transfer Pricing Policy Practice Statement („the Statement‟) to provide the latest 
policy guidance to industry and relevant stakeholders on the subject matter.  

The Statement replaces the existing Practice Statement PS2009/21on the 
subject.  

The Statement incorporates some amendments that seek to further clarify 
Customs and Border Protection policies on valuation of imported goods that 
involve transfer pricing arrangements. Inputs from industry and relevant 
stakeholders were considered in the development of the Statement. 

Consistent with the relevant provisions of the WTO Valuation Agreement and 
the Customs Act 1901, the Statement streamlines and clarifies the current 
valuation policies relating to transfer pricing for the benefit of the trading 
community. In addition, the Statement provides clarity on technical concepts 
such as “circumstances surrounding the sale” and related requirements of 
Customs and Border Protection relevant to transfer pricing Valuation Advice 
(VA) applicants. 

The Statement is intended to accord more flexibility for traders to show that the 
relationship between the related parties has not influenced the price of the 
goods sold between such parties. It improves upon and retains many aspects of 
the current Practice Statement to facilitate a seamless and smooth transition to 
the new policy.

Customs and Border Protection’s Approach to Managing 
Cargo Reporting Compliance 

The purpose of this Notice is to inform you that Australian Customs Notice 2007/03 – 
‘Customs Approach to Managing Cargo Reporting Compliance’ is withdrawn. 

ACN 2007/03 provided information to cargo reporters about Customs and Border 
Protection’s interim approach to managing non-compliance with certain 
Customs Act 1901 cargo reporting requirements. 

A key element of ACN 2007/03 was that Customs and Border Protection would not 
issue an infringement notice to a cargo reporter if they displayed a sustained improving 
trend in relation to the timeliness of their cargo reports. Significant time has passed 
since the publication of ACN 2007/03, and this interim approach to cargo reporting 
compliance no longer reflects Customs and Border Protection’s expectations. 

Customs and Border Protection requires accurate and timely cargo information to 
effectively undertake a proper risk assessment and facilitate clearance of the cargo. 

Accordingly, ACN 2007/03 is withdrawn and Customs and Border Protection will 
apply the Infringement Notice Scheme to cargo reporting obligations covered by that 
Notice in the same way it does to other breaches of the Customs Act. 

You should read this Notice 2013/20 in conjunction with Australian Customs Cargo 
Advice 2011/09 – ‘Cargo Reporting Timeliness’and ACN 2006/17 – ‘Customs ’ 
Approach to Managing Cargo Reporting Compliance’, which clearly set out the 
requirements for cargo reporting. You should also read this Notice in conjunction with 
the Infringement Notice Scheme Guidelines (2010).

NO. 2013/25 

New Customs laws to strengthen the supply chain against 
criminal infiltration receive Royal Assent 

The Customs and AusCheck Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other 
Measures) Act 2013 (the Act) received Royal Assent on 28 May 2013.  Some of the 
measures commence the day after Royal Assent. 

What are the Customs Act 1901 changes and why are they necessary? 

Two reports have highlighted organised crime threats and vulnerabilities in the 
maritime and aviation sectors: the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement 
(PJCLE) 2011 report following its Inquiry into the adequacy of aviation and maritime 
security measures to combat serious and organised crime; and a 2012 report prepared 
by Joint Task Force Polaris that examined criminality in the Sydney maritime 
environment.   

Issues identified by the Polaris and the PJCLE reports include: 

• 

• 

• 

individuals with access to restricted zones at airports and seaports have been 
identified on law enforcement high threat priority target lists, 
individuals using access to cargo movement information to track illicit goods 
and providing that information to criminal groups, and 
individuals accessing containers in terminals to collect illicit goods for criminal 
groups.  

The amendments to the Customs Act implement a number of recommendations of 
these reports and seek to strengthen the cargo supply chain against criminal infiltration 
by: 

•  Placing statutory obligations on Cargo Terminal Operators (CTOs) and those 
that load and unload cargo, which are similar to those that the Customs Act 
imposes on holders of depot and warehouse licences.  These obligations 
include mandatory reporting of unlawful activity, ensuring the physical security 
of relevant premises and cargo, and fit and proper person checks on 
management at Custom’s request.  Non-compliance will attract criminal or 
administrative sanctions. 

•  Creating new offences for using information from the Integrated Cargo System 

(ICS) to aid a criminal organisation. 

•  Providing that the CEO of Customs and Border Protection can consider the 
suspension, refusal or cancellation of an Aviation or Maritime Security 
Identification Card (ASIC or MSIC) when determining whether the person is fit 
and proper under the Customs Act.

Customs and Other Legislation Amendment (LAG and Other 
Measures) Regulation 2013 

Since 31 March 2007, international security restrictions set out in the Aviation Transport 
Security Regulations 2005, have prevented passengers from carrying liquid, aerosol and gel 
(LAG) products onto international flights as cabin baggage unless the product is 100 millilitres 
(or less) and the products are sealed in one transparent, one litre plastic bag (or less).   

To allow for the continued duty, GST and WET free sale of these products from off-airport 
retailers after that date, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and the Australian Customs and 
Border Protection Service (ACBPS) introduced arrangements whereby travellers removed the 
invoice attached to the outside of the sealed bag for LAG products greater than 100 millilitres 
prior to packing the LAG products in their luggage. The passenger then presented the invoice to 
the airside agent of the retailer.  These arrangements were consistent with aviation security 
restrictions however the Sealed Bag Scheme rules in the A New Tax System (Goods and 
Services Tax) Regulations 1999, the Excise Regulations 1925 and the Customs Regulations 
1926 did not provide for this arrangement.  

The Customs and Other Legislation Amendment (LAG and Other Measures) Regulation 2013 
has amended these three sets of regulations to provide legislative support for the arrangements 
put in place by the ATO and ACBPS.  It ensures that people who, on or after 31 March 2007, 
have acted in accordance with these sealed bag arrangements would be taken to have 
complied with the SBS rules set out in these three sets of regulations. 

The Customs and Other Legislation Amendment (LAG and Other Measures) Regulation 2013 
does not require any changes to current processes on the part of travellers or retailers.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2013-31.pdf,Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – 1 August 2013,"AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 
2013/31 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – 1 August 2013 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released the June Quarter 2013 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 24 July 2013.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff) and section 6A of the Excise Tariff 
Act 1921, the rates of customs and excise duties on certain spirits, beer and tobacco will 
increase on 1 August 2013.  This Notice sets out the new rates in Tables 1 and 2 over leaf. 

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in those tables are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, that is, the June Quarter 2013 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after December 1983.  Accordingly, the 
June 2013 index number (102.8) has been divided by the December 2012 index number (102.0) 
to establish an indexation factor of 1.008.  As this factor is more than one, rates of customs and 
excise duty are increased by the application of this factor. 

Note that these rates also apply to goods subject to indexation in Schedule 5 (US originating 
goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), 
Schedule 8 (AANZ originating goods) and Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods) in the 
Customs Tariff. 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) has arranged for the 
publication of a Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty (Notice (No. 3) 2013) in the 
Commonwealth Gazette on 1 August 2013.

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme - Allocations for 2013-2014  

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service advises that it has determined 2013-14 
allocations under the Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme that it administers on behalf of the 
Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The allocation was gazetted on 3 July 2013 in 
the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette - Tariff Concessions No. 2013/26. 

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 
23-month period ending 31 May 2013, as shown in Customs’ records of clearances for home 
consumption.  This calculation excludes any part of the quota that was transferred to another 
importer during the 23-month period or that was unused as at 31 May 2013.   

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota 
allocated, importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or 
curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that 
year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian goods), 
or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, preference 
circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement, quota is unable to be used.  

The cheese or curd is considered to be ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a) 
(b) 

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs, and   
the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port or 
airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged. 

Quota allocations are transferable between importers.  A person may apply to transfer quota 
entitlements by completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) 
available at www.customs.gov.au.  The website also contains a Fact Sheet about the Cheese 
and Curd Quota.

2013/38 

Amendments to Customs Regulations 1926  

The Customs Regulations 1926 (the Regulations) are amended to provide a definition for 
All Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) to clarify what goods are captured under that term. ATVs are 
defined as motorised off-road vehicles designed to travel on four wheels with a seat designed to 
be straddled by the operator and having handle bars to control steering.  

The Regulations are also amended to include Utility Terrain Vehicles (UTVs) in column 3 of item 
39 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations. UTVs are defined as motorised off-road vehicles designed 
to travel on four or more wheels having side-by-side seating, a cylinder capacity not exceeding 
1500 cm3 and a steering wheel. 

The inclusion of UTVs in column 3 of item 39 in Schedule 2 of the Regulations means that a 
Tariff Concession Order (TCO) could be made in respect of UTVs where the TCO conditions set 
out in Part XVA of the Customs Act 1901 are met. 

The Regulations are also amended to repeal redundant regulations that are associated with the 
Accredited Client Program (the ACP). The legislative provisions concerning the ACP in the 
Customs Act 1901 were repealed by Part 7 of the Customs Amendment (Miscellaneous 
Measures) Act 2013, with effect from 31 March 2013. 

The above amendments took effect on 7 August 2013.

NOTICE NO. 2013/58 

Increase in excise equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco 
products on 1 December 2013, and changes to tobacco indexation  

Changes to excise equivalent customs duty 

On 6 November 2013, the Government announced it would proceed with a series of four 12.5 
per cent increases in excise and excise equivalent customs duty for tobacco and tobacco 
products. The first increase will apply on and from 1 December 2013.  

The rates on tobacco and tobacco products will rise from $0.35731 to $0.40197 per stick not 
exceeding 0.8 grams actual tobacco content in weight, and from $446.65 to $502.48 per 
kilogram of tobacco content for other tobacco. 

Further 12.5 per cent increases in excise equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco 
products will apply from 1 September 2014, 1 September 2015 and 1 September 2016. 

Changes to tobacco indexation 

On 6 November, the Government also announced that the basis for indexation of tobacco 
excise and excise equivalent customs duty rates would change from Consumer Price Index 
(CPI) to average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE). 

At present, excise equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco products is indexed using 
CPI on 1 February and 1 August.  However, the dates will move to 1 March and 1 September, 
and the basis for indexation will change to AWOTE on 1 March 2014. Tobacco and tobacco 
products will continue to be indexed bi-annually. As a result, there will be no 1 February 2014 
CPI indexation of tobacco. However, the 1 February CPI indexation of alcohol will remain.  

Tariff classifications in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff affected by the increase are set out in 
the Table below.  These rate increases apply to goods imported from all countries of origin, 
including under Australia’s Free Trade Agreements: Schedule 5 (US originating goods), 
Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), Schedule 8 (AANZ 
originating goods) and Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods) of the Customs Tariff.

NO. 2013/62 

New legislative measures commence to strengthen the supply 
chain against criminal infiltration  

The Customs and AusCheck Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other 
Measures) Act 2013 (the Organised Crime Act) received Royal Assent on 28 May 2013.  
It amends the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) and the AusCheck Act 2007 (AusCheck 
Act) to mitigate vulnerabilities at Australia’s borders.  The Organised Crime Act is part 
of a package of measures to deter and prevent infiltration by serious and organised 
crime into Australia’s seaports, airports and cargo supply chain (ACBPNs 2013/12 and 
2013/25 refer). 

Commencement of the measures in the Organised Crime Act 

Most measures in the Organised Crime Act commence on 28 November 2013.  The 
new offences for misusing information held by Customs commenced on 
29 May 2013 and we expect the changes to the infringement notice scheme to 
commence on 1 February 2014, subject to the approval of the associated regulation.  
Please see the table at the end of this notice, which sets out the key legislative changes 
and their respective commencement dates.  

Supporting Regulations 

As part of implementing the Organised Crime Act, it is necessary to prescribe certain 
matters in regulations.  On 3 October 2013, ACBPS released an exposure draft of the 
Customs Amendment (Record Keeping Requirements and Other Measures) Regulation 
2013 for industry comment.  On 18 October 2013, ACBPS released an exposure draft of 
the Customs Amendment (Infringement Notices) Regulation 2013.  The exposure 
period for these regulations has concluded.  The Record Keeping Regulation came into 
effect on 28 November 2013 and incorporated industry feedback.  The Record Keeping 
Regulation is available on the COMLAW website here 
http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013L01968.  

ACBPS is finalising the Infringement Notice Regulation for Executive Council 
consideration.

NO. 2013/64 

Authorised Agents 

The purpose of this Notice is to clarify the legislative requirements for those persons purporting 
to act on behalf of the owner of goods imported into Australia.  This Notice replaces Australian 
Customs Notice No. 2007/56, which we have withdrawn. 

Key points 

•  Only the owner of the goods or a licensed customs broker may enter the goods for 

• 

home consumption. 
It is not an offence for a licensed customs broker to enter the goods for home 
consumption without written authority from the owner of the goods. 

•  Freight forwarders and other businesses that are not themselves licensed customs 

brokers should not describe their businesses as customs brokerages. 

Authority to act 

The Customs Act 1901 (the Act) provides that only the owner of goods or a customs broker 
licensed by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Customs can submit an import declaration to 
import goods.  Section 180 of the Act specifically provides that a customs broker means a 
person who holds a broker’s licence that is in force.  These requirements do not apply to the 
making of an export entry or self-assessed clearance (SAC) declaration under section 71AAAF 
of the Act. 

Because of the complexity of the laws governing the importation of goods into Australia (similar 
to those of most other countries) and the potential financial and other implications of lodging an 
incorrect entry, most importers of goods choose to engage or allow, either explicitly or implicitly, 
a licensed customs broker to act on their behalf. 

A person who submits an import declaration and is not the owner of the goods or a licensed 
customs broker commits an offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 30 penalty units for a 
natural person or 150 penalty units for a body corporate (sections 181(4) and (5)).  

Section 181 appears to contemplate that the owner of the goods would authorise the licensed 
customs broker in writing to act on their behalf before the customs broker actually enters the 
goods for home consumption in order to be capable of complying with the requirements of the 
Act. 

However, it is ACBPS’s view that section 181 must be construed in the context of other 
provisions in Division 2 of Part XI of the Act, including section 183.  Section 183 provides that 
where a person holds himself or herself out as an agent of an owner of goods, that person is 
deemed to be the owner of the goods.  In such circumstances, the person acting as if he or she 
were the agent may become liable for any duty payable on the goods.  There is no penalty for 
holding oneself out as an agent, per se. 

Further, it is open to ACBPS to require a person who claims to be an agent of the owner of 
goods to produce written authority from the owner authorising the person to act as an agent 
(section 182).  If the purported agent fails to produce the written authority, the Customs officer 
may refuse to recognise their authority, which could delay the release of the goods.  These

AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 
NO. 2013/66 

Changes to the Import Processing Charge 

The Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 2013 has passed both Houses of Parliament. 
It is expected that Royal Assent will be completed shortly. The Bill amends the  Import 
Processing Charges Act 2001  to increase the import processing charges for air, sea and post 
consignments with a value of $10,000 or more. The current import processing charges for 
consignments valued at more than $1,000 and less than $10,000 will continue to apply. There 
will continue to be no import processing charge for consignments valued at $1,000 or less. 

These changes introduce a two-tiered schedule of charges that will come into effect on 
1 January 2014. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice 2013/63; ""Import 
Processing Charges Amendment Bill 2013"" provides background information on these changes. 

The revised schedule of charges is summarised in the table below.

Cornpliance 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) will monitor implementation of 
the new import processing charge arrangements to ensure compliance. 

Where ACBPS identifies misreporting of cargo resulting in an underpayment of the charge or 
avoidance of the charge altogether, the Service has a variety of treatment options available to it 
depending on the circumstances of the case. These options range from education and 
warnings, administrative action such as the imposition of infringement notices, through to 
prosecution.

             Customs Amendment (Infringement Notices) Regulation 2013   

The Customs Amendment (Infringement Notices) Regulation 2013, which was previously 
released to industry as an exposure draft, has been approved and will commence on  
1 February 2014.  

Background 
The Customs and AusCheck Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other 
Measures) Act 2013 (Organised Crime Act) received Royal Assent on 28 May 2013 
(ACBPNs 2013/12, 2013/25 & 2013/62 refer).  The Organised Crime Act amends the 
Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) and the AusCheck Act 2007 to mitigate vulnerabilities at 
Australia’s borders.   

As part of implementing the Organised Crime Act, it is necessary to prescribe certain 
matters in regulations. Section 243X of the Customs Act provides a regulation making 
power to establish an infringement notice scheme.   

On 18 October 2013, ACBPS released an exposure draft of the Customs Amendment 
(Infringement Notices) Regulation 2013 and associated draft infringement notice scheme 
(INS) Guide for industry comment (ACBPN 2013/52 refers).  Several members of the 
trading community provided comments, with most comments focussed on the draft Guide 
rather than the Regulation.  An updated INS Guide, incorporating aspects of the industry 
feedback, will be published on the ACBPS website before commencement of the 
Regulation. We have included additional information in the Regulation’s Explanatory 
Statement in response to some of the feedback provided by industry regarding the 
Regulation itself.   

Infringement Notice Scheme Regulation 
The Customs Amendment (Infringement Notices) Regulation 2013 was approved by the 
Federal Executive Council on 12 December 2013 and is available on the COMLAW 
website here.

2014/03 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – 1 February 2014 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released the December Quarter 2013 Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) figures on 22 January 2014.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), the rates of customs and excise 
duties on certain spirits and beer will increase on 1 February 2014.  This Notice sets out the 
new rates in Tables 1 and 2. 

Please note tobacco and tobacco products are no longer indexed in February. They will be 
indexed based on average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) figures on 1 March 2014. 

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in Tables 1 and 2 are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, that is, the December Quarter 2013 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after the June Quarter 1983.  

Accordingly, the December Quarter 2013 index number (104.8) has been divided by the June 
Quarter 2013 index number (102.8) to establish an indexation factor of 1.019. As this factor is 
greater than one, rates of customs and excise duty are increased by the application of this 
factor. 

Note that these rates also apply to goods subject to indexation in Schedule 5 (US originating 
goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), 
Schedule 8 (AANZ originating goods) and Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods) in the 
Customs Tariff. 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) has arranged for the 
publication of a Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty Notice (No. 1) 2014 in the 
Commonwealth Gazette on 3 February 2014.

NO. 2014/07 

Commencement of the new Infringement Notice Scheme 

The Customs and AusCheck Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) 
Act 2013 (Organised Crime Act) received Royal Assent on 28 May 2013.  The legislation made 
significant changes to the Customs Act 1901 Infringement Notice Scheme (INS).  These 
changes improve the utility of the INS by increasing penalties to encourage greater compliance 
and to move aspects of the scheme into the Customs Regulations to provide some flexibility and 
simplification. 

Commencement of the new Infringement Notice Scheme  
The new Customs Act INS comes into effect on 1 February 2014 when the Customs 
Amendment (Infringement Notices) Regulation 2013 commences.  We have published an INS 
Guide on the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) website here, which 
explains the ACBPS approach to issuing an infringement notice and set outs the amount 
payable under an infringement notice for a natural person or body corporate who has allegedly 
committed an offence. 

The INS Guide incorporates some of the feedback we received from industry and others during 
the exposure draft period (ACBPN 2013/52 refers).    

Please note that the current Customs Act INS and INS Guidelines continue to apply where the 
date of the alleged offence occurred before 1 February 2014, even if the infringement notice is 
issued on or after 1 February 2014.  The new Customs Act INS and Guide apply where the date 
of the alleged offence occurs on or after 1 February 2014. 

Further Information  
You can find further information about the measures in the Organised Crime Act, including the 
changes to the INS, on the ACBPS website at http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page4271.asp.

2014/12 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates for tobacco and 
tobacco products – 1 March 2014 

On 1 March 2014 excise duty and customs duty on tobacco and tobacco products will be 
indexed according to average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) instead of the Consumer 
Price Index (CPI). AWOTE adjustments still occur biannually, but are scheduled for 1 March and 
1 September each year, to align with the release of AWOTE data from the Australian Bureau of 
Statistics (ABS).  

The last CPI indexation of tobacco products occurred on 1 August 2013 and the first AWOTE 
indexation is scheduled for 1 March 2014. 

The ABS released the December Quarter 2013 AWOTE amount on 20 February 2014 and this 
Notice sets out the new rates in Tables 1 and 2. 

The indexation factor is worked out by dividing the most recent AWOTE amount by the highest 
AWOTE amount for a previous quarter that does not precede the June quarter 2013. Therefore, 
the indexation factor for the first indexation adjustment using AWOTE in March 2014 is 
determined by dividing the December 2013 AWOTE amount by the June 2013 AWOTE amount.  

Accordingly, the December Quarter 2013 index number (1437.00) has been divided by the June 
Quarter 2013 index number (1420.90) to establish an indexation factor of 1.011. As this factor is 
greater than one, rates of customs duty and excise duty are increased by the application of this 
factor.  

These increased rates also apply to tobacco and tobacco products in Schedule 5 (US 
originating goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), 
Schedule 8 (AANZ originating goods) and Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods) in the 
Customs Tariff. 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) will arrange for the publication 
of a Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty Notice (No. 2) 2014 in the Commonwealth 
Gazette on 3 March 2014.

NOTICE NO. 2014/15 

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 2014-2015 

In early June 2014, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will contact cheese 
and curd quota holders to discuss quota allocations for 2014-2015. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the actual use of quota by 
that importer in the 23-month period ending 31 May 2014, as shown in Customs’ records of 
Import Declarations lodged between 01 July 2012 and 31 May 2014. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the 
quota allocated, importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese 
or curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of 
that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian 
goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, 
then quota cannot be used.  Similarly, if preference circumstances or Free Trade Agreements 
(FTAs) apply, then quota is not available.  

The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a) 
(b) 

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs; and   
the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port 
or airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged. 

Please note that: 

• 

• 

The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer 
during the 23-month period or that remains unused at 31 May 2014. 

Quota used during the month of June 2013 will be taken into consideration for allocation 
2015-2016, but will NOT count in computations for 2016-2017.  This June ‘factor’ is 
repetitive for every annual allocation because of the 31 May import performance cut-off 
for calculation of following year’s allocations. 

At this time of the year, quota users and their brokers should take stock of quota balances with 
a view to maximising usage and consequently maximising their next allocation. 

We will publish the final allocation in the Commonwealth of Australia: Tariff Concessions 
Gazette in July 2014.

NO. 2014/19 

New arrangements for travellers carrying liquids, aerosols, 
gels, creams or pastes on international flights 

At present, international aviation security restrictions prevent travellers from carrying a liquid, 
aerosol, gel, cream or paste (LAG) product on an international flight as cabin baggage unless 
the product is in a container that is 100 millilitres (or less) and the products are sealed in one 
transparent, one litre plastic bag (or less).   

Currently, travellers with a LAG product greater than 100 millilitres need to pack the product into 
their checked luggage.  For a LAG product(s) purchased free of duty, GST and WET from an 
off-airport duty-free shop, travellers are required to remove the sales invoice attached to the 
outside of the sealed bag prior to packing the product(s) in their luggage.  The travellers must 
present the sales invoice for the duty-free LAG product(s) to the airside agent of the duty-free 
shop. 

From 30 April 2014, with the introduction of security screening of LAG products at certain 
international airports (Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Gold Coast, Melbourne, Perth and 
Sydney airports), travellers may be allowed to carry LAG items purchased at an off-airport duty-
free shop in the aircraft cabin.  Travellers will be able to submit their LAG items purchased at an 
off-airport duty-free shop, including LAG items in a container that is greater than 100 millilitres, 
for screening by technology capable of detecting liquid explosives, provided the items are 
contained in the sealed bag provided at the time of purchase, with the sales invoice attached.  
Travellers will continue to have the option of packing their LAG items purchased at an off-airport 
duty-free shop into their checked luggage.    

If a LAG item purchased at an off-airport duty-free shop is cleared by the screening technology, 
the traveller can carry the item on an international flight as cabin baggage.  If an item cannot be 
cleared by the technology, the traveller will be asked to surrender it for disposal, and the sales 
invoice will be given to the airside agent of the off-airport duty-free shop.  If a traveller does not 
wish to submit their LAG items purchased at an off-airport duty-free shop for screening, the 
items can be placed in checked luggage, and the sales invoice given to the airside agent of the 
off-airport duty-free shop, as per existing procedures. 

Off-airport duty-free shop operators will still be required to place LAG items in sealed bags with 
accompanying proof of purchase in order for the items to be eligible to undergo security 
screening and to comply with the legislative requirements for making duty-free sales.  To assist 
with the screening process, LAG and non-LAG items should be packed in separate bags.  
Travellers will need to continue to present the sales invoice for their duty-free products to the 
airside agent of the off-airport duty-free shop. 

Enquiries concerning this notice may be directed to the Director, Cargo Reporting Policy and 
Licensing, on telephone number (02) 6275 8042.

Approved course of study for a customs broker’s licence 

This Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice (ACBPN) provides information on the new 
course of study that will need to be completed by anyone wishing to apply for a customs broker’s 
licence. 

This ACBPN supersedes Australian Customs Notice 2010/48 and other previous notices dealing with 
the approved course of study for a customs broker’s licence. 

Section 183CC of the Customs Act 1901 requires the Chief Executive Officer of Customs (the CEO) to 
grant a broker’s licence only if, in his opinion, the applicant is a fit and proper person and is qualified to 
be a customs broker.  A qualified customs broker must, unless exempted by the CEO, complete an 
approved course of study or instruction and have acquired experience that fits them to be a customs 
broker. 

In 2013, a review of the approved course of study was undertaken. As a result of that review, the CEO 
has approved a new course of study for a customs broker’s licence.  The new course of study is the 
Diploma of Customs Broking TLI50813.  Details of the Diploma, including the units of study that 
comprise the Diploma, are available at: http://training.gov.au/Training/Details/TLI50813.  

Those Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) that will be delivering the Diploma of Customs 
Broking will commence the course in Semester 2, 2014.  RTOs are no longer accepting enrolments in 
the current course of study but will continue to offer units in that course of study until the end of 
Semester 2, 2015.   

An applicant for a customs broker’s licence who is seeking recognition of prior learning or recognition 
of current competencies should contact their RTO for details.  

Enquiries concerning this ACBPN should be directed to Broker Licensing on telephone number 
(02) 6275 5784 or email brokers.licensing@customs.gov.au.

NO. 2014/23 

Definition of ‘Management or Control’ for Customs licensed depots and 
warehouses 

The purpose of this Notice is to provide guidance on the interpretation by the 
Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) of the term ‘management 
or control’ in the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act), as it applies to licensed depots and 
warehouses.  

The Customs Act requires all persons in management or control of a Customs licensed 
depot or warehouse to be fit and proper persons (refer to section 77K(1)(d) for depots 
and to section 81(1)(d) for warehouses).  

The ACBPS considers a person to be in management or control if they: 

 
 

 

have authority to direct operations or activities at a depot or warehouse; or 
are involved in, or have an influence over, the policies and procedures of the 
depot or warehouse; or 
direct the receipt or release of goods at a depot or warehouse.  

A person is considered to be in management irrespective of whether: 

 
 

their role is active or passive; and 
they are physically located at the depot or warehouse.   

The Depot Application Guide and the Warehouse Application Guide state that the 
following people are required to be fit and proper persons in order for a licence to be 
granted: 

the applicant for the licence (where the application is an individual person); 

 
  all partners (where the applicant is a partnership); and 
  all persons who will participate in the management or control of the depot or 

warehouse, including all company directors, officers, shareholders, managers, 
supervisors, and all staff who have control over the recording and movement of 
goods when they enter and leave the depot or warehouse. 

Examples of employees considered to be in management or control include, but are 
not limited to, those who: 

  are responsible for releasing dutiable goods from a duty free store (such as a 

cashier); 

  are entrusted with the physical security of the depot or warehouse (for example, 
they have keys to the premises, keys to the deadhouse, alarm deactivation/ 
activation codes, out-of-hours access); or 
record, and move, goods entering and or leaving the depot or warehouse. 



Carbon Tax Repeal changes for 1 July 2014 

This Notice summarises the changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs 
Tariff) resulting from Carbon Tax Repeal legislation, operative 1 July 2014. 

Aviation Fuel 

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Act 2014 (the Act) 
received Royal Assent on 17 July 2014. This Act amends the Customs Tariff to 
remove the carbon tax imposed on excise-equivalent duty applied on imported 
aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene (aviation fuels).  

Prior to the repeal of the carbon tax the duty applied to aviation fuel was a 
designated levy to fund the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) plus an 
aviation fuel carbon component. The new legislated rates remove the carbon 
tax component. The CASA component is not affected.  

The Act alters rates of duty for aviation gasoline and kerosene as set out in the 
Table below. The adjusted rates of duty apply to the listed subheadings in 
Schedule 3 and relevant items in Schedules 5 to 9 of the Customs Tariff, 
applicable to Australia’s free trade agreements.

2014/34 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – 1 August 2014 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released the June Quarter 2014 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 23 July 2014.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), the rates of excise-equivalent 
customs duty on certain spirits and beer will increase on 1 August 2014.  This Notice sets out 
the new rates of excise-equivalent customs duty in Table 1 and excise duty in Table 2. 

Please note tobacco and tobacco products are no longer indexed in line with the CPI. They will 
be indexed based on average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) figures on  
1 September and 1 March of each year. The next indexation will take place on 1 September 
2014. 

The new rates of customs and excise duty listed in Tables 1 and 2 are calculated by multiplying 
the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the 
most recent CPI number, that is, the June Quarter 2014 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after the June Quarter 1983.  

Accordingly, the June Quarter 2014 index number (105.9) has been divided by the December 
Quarter 2013 index number (104.8) to establish an indexation factor of 1.010. As this factor is 
greater than one, rates of excise-equivalent customs duty and excise duty are increased by the 
application of this factor. 

Note that these rates also apply to goods subject to indexation in Schedule 5 (US originating 
goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), 
Schedule 8 (AANZ originating goods) and Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods) in the 
Customs Tariff. 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) has arranged for the 
publication of a Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty Notice (No. 4) 2014 in the 
Commonwealth Gazette on 1 August 2014.

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme - Allocations for 2014-2015  

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service advises that it has determined 2014-15 
allocations under the Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme that it administers on behalf of the 
Department of Agriculture. The allocation was gazetted on 2 July 2014 in the Commonwealth of 
Australia Gazette - Tariff Concessions No. 2014/25. 

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 
23-month period ending 31 May 2014, as shown in Customs’ records of clearances for home 
consumption.  This calculation excludes any part of the quota that was transferred to another 
importer during the 23-month period or that was unused as at 31 May 2014.   

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota 
allocated, importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or 
curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that 
year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian goods), 
or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, preference 
circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement, quota is unable to be used.  

The cheese or curd is considered to be ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a) 
Customs, and   
(b) 

an entry for home consumption, which identifies item 55, for the goods is lodged with 

the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port or 
airport for the discharge of cargo. 

Quota allocations are transferable between importers.  A person may apply to transfer quota 
entitlements by completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) 
available at www.customs.gov.au.  The website also contains a Fact Sheet about the Cheese 
and Curd Quota.

2014/40 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates for tobacco and 
tobacco products – 1 September 2014 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the average weekly ordinary time earnings 
(AWOTE) amount of June Quarter 2014 on 14 August 2014.  In accordance with the indexation 
provisions in section 19AB of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), the rates of excise-
equivalent customs and excise duties on tobacco and tobacco products will increase on 
1 September 2014.  This Notice sets out the new rates in Tables 1 and 2. 

The indexation factor is worked out by dividing the most recent AWOTE amount by the highest 
AWOTE amount for a previous June or December quarter that does not precede the December 
quarter 2012. Therefore, the indexation factor for the second indexation adjustment using 
AWOTE in September 2014 is determined by dividing the June 2014 AWOTE amount by the 
December 2013 AWOTE amount.  

Accordingly, the June Quarter 2014 index number (1454.10) has been divided by the December 
Quarter 2013 index number (1437.00) to establish an indexation factor of 1.012. As this factor is 
greater than one, rates of excise-equivalent customs duty and excise duty are increased by the 
application of this indexation factor.  

On 6 November 2013, the Government announced it would proceed with a series of four 12.5 
per cent increases in excise and excise-equivalent customs duty for tobacco and tobacco 
products. The first increase was applied on 1 December 2013. Further 12.5 per cent increases 
in excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco products will apply from  
1 September 2014, 1 September 2015 and 1 September 2016. This increase is referred to as 
the “additional factor” in section 19AB of the Customs Tariff. The additional factor for  
1 September 2014 is 1.125. This factor is then applied to the new indexed rates of excise-
equivalent customs and excise duties. The calculation formula is:  

Tobacco duty rate 
on the day before     ×     1.012    ×      1.125  
1 September 2014     

These increased rates also apply to tobacco and tobacco products in Schedule 5 (US 
originating goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), 
Schedule 8 (AANZ originating goods) and Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods) in the 
Customs Tariff. 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will arrange for the publication of a 
Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty Notice (No. 5) 2014 in the Commonwealth Gazette 
on 1 September 2014.

On 31 July 2014, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) revoked 
Australian Customs Notice No. 2000/30 (“Free into Store Transactions (DDP/DDU)”) as it was 
out of date for a number of reasons. 

Since the revocation of the Notice, the ACBPS has received numerous enquiries on one aspect 
of that Notice, i.e. who is the importer in delivered duty paid (DDP) transactions for the purposes 
of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999. 

In light of those recent enquiries on the GST treatment of DDP transactions, the ACBPS will 
shortly issue an updated Notice on the subject. 

Enquiries  concerning  this  Notice  may  be  directed  to  the  Director,  Border  Control  and 
Clearance Framework Section, on telephone number (02) 6275 8042.

CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SCHEME 
FOR LICENSED CUSTOMS BROKERS: REVIEW OUTCOMES 

In May 2014, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) issued Australian 
Customs and Border Protection Notice No. 2014/20, announcing that it was reviewing the 
Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Scheme for licensed customs brokers, and inviting 
submissions from interested parties on the CPD Scheme.  Submissions closed on 
30 June 2014.    

In light of the submissions received, the ACBPS developed draft recommendations, which it 
circulated for comment to those interested parties that lodged a submission to the review.   

The ACBPS conducted an industry workshop in Sydney in September 2014 to discuss the draft 
recommendations with those interested parties that lodged a submission. 

Taking into account the discussions at the industry workshop, the ACBPS further refined its 
draft recommendations, which were again circulated for comment to those who attended the 
industry workshop.  In light of those final industry comments, the ACBPS has decided to 
implement the revisions that are outlined in the attachment to this Notice.  The revisions will 
take effect from the beginning of the next CPD year, i.e. 1 April 2015.  A revised CPD Scheme 
paper, incorporating all of the revisions, will be published before the beginning of the next CPD 
year.

Australian Customs and 
Border Protection Service 

AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 
NO. 2014/49 

Labelling Requirements for Pharmaceutical Goods — 
Including Medicine 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) administer the labelling 
requirements for imported goods under the Commerce Trade Descriptions Act 1905 (the CTDA) 
and the Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940 (the Regulations) at the border. 

The CTDA prohibits the importation of certain goods if a false trade description is applied. The 
Regulations outline labelling requirements in relation to different types of imported goods (for 
example, specifying that a country of origin and/or a true description must be displayed on 
certain goods). 

The importation of therapeutic goods, as well as the subsequent domestic supply is also 
controlled under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (the TG Act) for which the Therapeutic Goods 
Administration (TGA) has policy responsibility. 

Labelling requirements for pharmaceuticals are set out in Therapeutic Goods Order No. 69 — 
General Requirements for Labels for Medicines (TGO 69), issued under the TG Act. Under TGO 
69, country of origin information is not a matter that is required to be on the label. 

The Regulations are currently scheduled for sunsetting in April 2016 under the sunsetting 
provisions of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, unless re-negotiated and re-enacted. 

At this time, ACBPS will ensure that any provisions subsequently re-enacted will be in line with 
the current Australian Government policy. 

In the interim, ACBPS will cease to enforce the CTDA and the Regulations regarding country of 
origin labelling on imported pharmaceutical products. 

Importers will still be expected to satisfy the requirements of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 
and TGO 69 when importing and supplying pharmaceutical products and, under the CTDA, will 
still be required to provide a true and accurate description of the goods on the packaging which 
will not mislead a consumer as to the nature of the goods. 

If the importer chooses to include the country of origin on the goods, it must be accurate. 
Additionally words and imagery included on the label must not mislead the consumer as to the 
country of origin where this is not specified on the label (for example, a display of the Australian 
flag, or the use of a phrase such as ""Australian owned""). 

The Intellectual Property and Consumer Goods team is the primary point of contact in ACBPS 
regarding the policy surrounding the labelling requirements for Pharmaceutical Goods including 
Medicine and enquiries can be forwarded to the labelling mailbox at labelling@customs.gov.au.

NO. 2014/50 

Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) Transactions 

As foreshadowed in Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice No. 2014/43, 
this Notice provides general guidance on delivered duty paid (DDP) transactions for the 
purposes of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) and the A New Tax System (Goods 
and Services Tax) Act 1999 (GST Act). 

Background 

(i) DDP transaction 

The International Chamber of Commerce’s Incoterms 2010 describes a DDP 
transaction as a transaction where: 

… the seller delivers the goods when the goods are placed at the 
disposal of the buyer, cleared for import on the arriving means of 
transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination.  The 
seller bears all the costs and risks involved in bringing the goods to the 
place of destination and has an obligation to clear the goods not only for 
export but also for import, to pay any duty for both export and import and 
to carry out all customs formalities.   

This means that in a DDP transaction the overseas supplier undertakes to deliver the 
goods to the premises specified in the contract of sale and to incur all costs in doing 
so.  The overseas supplier’s contractual responsibilities include carrying out all 
customs formalities and acquitting any liability for customs duty and goods and 
services tax (GST).   

The abovementioned responsibilities of an overseas supplier in a DDP transaction 
should be reflected in the contract of sale between the Australian buyer and the 
overseas supplier. 

(ii) Customs Act 

Section 68 of the Customs Act requires goods that are imported into Australia to be 
entered for home consumption or for warehousing by the owner of the goods. 

Section 4 of the Customs Act defines “owner” in relation to goods as: 

… any person (other than an officer of Customs) being or holding 
himself or herself out to be the owner, importer, exporter, consignee, 
agent, or person possessed of, or beneficially interested in, or having 
any control of, or power of disposition over the goods. 

In a DDP transaction, both the overseas seller/supplier and the Australian 
purchaser/consignee are “the owner”.  Either could enter the goods for home

Guidance for licensed customs brokers on preventing     

identity theft 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) has recently undertaken work 
to identify licensed customs brokers who were responsible for lodging the Full Import 
Declaration (FID) for ‘piggyback’ consignments.  

A piggyback occurs when an unscrupulous entity uses the identifying details of a legitimate 
entity on the Cargo Report or the FID for a consignment without the knowledge of the legitimate 
entity. In all of the identified cases, the relevant consignment contained illicit substances or 
smuggled goods.  In some of these cases, ACBPS considers the licensed customs broker has 
intentionally, recklessly or carelessly, facilitated identity fraud.  

As advised in ACBPN 2012/73 ‘Customs broker obligations – standard letter’, the statutory 
scheme for the licensing of brokers has two distinct but complementary purposes. 

  protection of the Commonwealth Revenue, and 
  protection of the community, notably that government agencies should be able to 

establish the true identity of parties undertaking international trade and in a self-
assessment context, customs brokers should take responsible steps to establish the 
identity of their clients for the purposes of the Customs Act.  

Licensed customs brokers must take reasonable steps to verify the identity of their clients and 
this is not necessarily an onerous task. In the context of piggyback consignments, a simple 
search of your client on the internet would reveal discrepancies between the details you have 
been provided and the legitimate entity’s details. In many of the piggyback cases we have 
examined, these types of simple verification activities would have alerted the broker to a 
possible case of identity fraud.  

ACBPS recently met with some customs brokers who had lodged FIDs for consignments found 
to be piggybacks. Several customs brokers indicated that they provide brokerage services to 
freight forwarders where they have little or no contact with the importer directly. ACBPS 
considers this a risky practice for brokers who make statements to the Commonwealth on behalf 
of an entity they know very little about. In the event that ACBPS found the statement to be false 
or misleading, the broker who lodged it would have a level of liability and in some cases may 
have committed an offence.   

This can have among other things, significant financial ramifications for the broker, particularly 
in matters where the amount of duty evaded is large. For example, section 243T of the Customs 
Act 1901, which applies to agents of an importer, makes it an offence to make a false or 
misleading statement resulting in a duty shortfall. Section 243T(3) provides that for a natural 
person, the maximum penalty is 60 penalty units ($10,200) or the duty short paid, whichever is 
greater; for a company, the maximum penalty is 300 penalty units ($51,000) or five times the 
duty short paid, whichever is greater.  These penalties would be in addition to paying back the 
amount owing to the Commonwealth.

2014/53 

Increase in fuel duty rates from 10 November 2014 for CPI indexation 
and the re-introduction of the biannual CPI indexation of those rates on  
1 February and 1 August of each year 

The Government announced in its 2014-2015 Budget the re-introduction of indexation to the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the excise and excise-equivalent customs duty on certain locally 
manufactured and imported fuels, including gaseous fuels. 

On 30 October 2014, the Government introduced Excise Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2014 and 
Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2014 in the House of Representatives to give effect to this 
measure.  The proposals take effect on 10 November 2014 and set the rate of excise and 
excise-equivalent customs duty for fuels (excluding aviation fuels) as follows:  

•  $0.386 per litre for liquid fuels 

•  $0.101 per litre for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) 

•  $0.212 per kilogram for compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). 

Fuel indexation will operate in the same way as the indexation of the rates of excise and excise-
equivalent customs duty applying to alcohol on 1 February and 1 August each year in line with 
CPI.   

The indexed rates of excise and excise-equivalent customs duty for fuels (excluding aviation 
fuels) will be rounded to three decimal places of a dollar. This will have the effect of simplifying 
the fuel tax credit claim calculation for fuels such as petrol and diesel that currently have a rate 
of duty calculated to five decimal places of a dollar. 

Note that these rates also apply to petroleum products listed in Schedule 5 (US originating 
goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), 
Schedule 8 (AANZ originating goods) and Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods) in the 
Customs Tariff.  Indexation will also apply to these goods when listed in new Schedule 10 
(Korean originating goods) and Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods) in the Customs Tariff 
and will come into effect on the entry into force of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement 
and the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement.  

Attachment 1 to this Notice lists the customs tariff subheadings and new duty rates for imported 
fuels subject to indexation.  Attachment 2 lists the excise tariff sub-item numbers and duty rates 
for locally manufactured fuels subject to indexation.

AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 
NO. 2014/58 

New exemption for low volume imports of Ozone Depleting 
Substances and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Equipment 

From 15 November 2014, a licence is no longer required for a low volume import of equipment 
containing Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) or Synthetic Greenhouse Gases (SGG), if all of 
the following conditions are met: 

• 
• 
• 

there are no more than five units of ODS/SGG equipment in a single consignment; and 
there is less than 10 kg in total of HCFC, HFC, PFC, or SF6; and 
the importer has not had an import of ODS/SGG equipment in the past two years. 

Ozone Depleting Substances and Synthetic Greenhouse Gases are commonly found in 
refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment (as well as in electrical switchgear, aerosols and a 
wide range of other products). 

Previously, one-off, low volume importers of ODS/SGG equipment required a Low Volume 
Import Licence (LVIL) costing $400. This licence has now been abolished. 

Regular importers of ODS/SGG equipment or importers exceeding the above threshold will 
continue to require a full ODS/SGG Equipment Licence (EQPL), costing $3,000. 

The online application for an EQPL can be found on the Department of the Environment's 
website (under the heading 'Licence Application Forms') at:

Australian Customs and

AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 
NO. 2014/59 

New illegal logging laws now apply to timber importers 

A new element of the Australian Government's illegal logging laws, as outlined in the  Illegal 
Logging Prohibition Amendment Regulation 2013, came into effect on 30 November 2014. 

Importers of regulated timber and timber products (as defined in Schedule 1 of the Regulation) 
now need to assess and manage the risk that the timber may have been illegally logged before 
importing that product. This is known as carrying out due diligence. 

Due diligence requires an importer of regulated timber and timber products to gather 
information, assess the risk that the timber product they are importing may have been illegally 
logged and then, unless assessed as low risk, undertake reasonable steps to mitigate any risk. 

The regulated timber products are identified using Customs Tariff Codes and fit within Chapters 
44, 47, 48 and 94. This includes most timber and wood-based products such as sawn timber, 
veneer, mouldings, wood panels, plywood, pulp, paper and wooden furniture. 

The following products are exempt from the due diligence requirements: 

products made out of recycled materials 

• 	

products imported into Australia where the combined value of the regulated products 
does not exceed AUD$1,000 

packaging material used to support, protect or carry another product 

The importer will also be asked to make a declaration to Australian Customs and Border 
Protection Service about compliance with these requirements. This will be in the form of a new 
illegal logging community protection question, which will be answered as part of the full import 
declaration process. 

Further information on the new requirements can be found on the Department of Agriculture's 
website: agriculture.gov.au/illegallogging. You can also contact them by emailing: 
illegallogging@agriculture.gov.au  or calling on 1800 657 313 (during business hours).

AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 
NO. 2014/61 

International Ships Undertaking Maintenance and Repair — 
Interim Process 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) has been working to clarify the 
requirements in relation to an international ship entering dry dock to undertake scheduled 
maintenance and repair. As part of the broader government policy position to reduce regulatory 
burden on business, the ACBPS is investigating options to relieve the issues associated with 
dry dock. 

In considering the broader maritime environment and how best to manage the dry dock 
arrangements, the ACBPS is also examining its requirements in light of the review of coastal 
shipping, currently being undertaken by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional 
Development. Pending any decisions or outcomes from this review, the ACBPS considers it 
would be appropriate to maintain an interim process to avoid regulatory conflict with any 
potential outcomes from the coastal shipping review. 

In the interim the ACBPS proposes to manage international ships undertaking scheduled 
maintenance and repair by not requiring an import entry (entry for home consumption). All 
relevant circumstances, including consideration of a reasonable amount of time in dry dock to 
undertake repairs of the kind the ship is undergoing as well as whether there is any change in 
circumstances, such as ownership of the ship, will be used to determine whether entry is 
actually appropriate in the situation. 

In order to achieve this outcome masters and operators of international ships undertaking dry 
dock activities are asked to assist by facilitating the following: 

1.  Vessel processing on arrival including crew changes, securing of prohibited and dutiable 

goods on board. 

2.  Liaison with the vessel about requirements regarding goods, crew and visitor movements 

including: 
•  provision of a full inventory of all goods and equipment to be taken on board or removed 

• 

from the ship, prior to commencement of the dry-docking; and 
reporting any adjustment or additions to that inventory during and at the end of the dry-
docking; 

3.  No consumption of 'ships stores' (other than food) is permitted during the dry docking. 

Specifically, alcohol or tobacco products should be secured and sealed at the 
commencement of the dry-dock and any new stores taken on board must be dealt with in 
accordance with normal requirements for visiting vessels. 

4.  Monitor visitor movements by requiring written notification of proposed visitors at least 24 
hours before planned visit, with approval/refusal returned in writing on the same business 
day. 

5.  Reconciliation of crew before departure. 
6.  Checks of records of goods moved on and off vessel against the inventory provided under 

item 2.

Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement – 

Rules of Origin 

The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement (JAEPA) was signed on 8 July 2014, 
during an official ceremony at Parliament House in Canberra. 

JAEPA will enter into force on 15 January 2015.  On entry into force importers will be entitled to 
duty-free entry for most goods imported from Japan, provided the goods meet the JAEPA Rules 
of Origin (ROO).  

This Notice summarises the rules for determining whether a good originates in Japan for the 
purposes of JAEPA. 

‘Free’ rates of customs duty 

The Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), as amended by the Customs Tariff Amendment 
(Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Act 2014, will allow duty 
free entry of most Japanese originating goods when JAEPA is implemented.  Preferential 
treatment will apply to Japanese originating goods that are imported on or after 15 January 
2015, or to goods imported before that day and entered for home consumption on or after that 
day. 

Other duties and taxes 

While most Japanese originating goods will be eligible for „free‟ rates of customs duty, other 
duties and taxes such as excise-equivalent duties, goods and services tax, dumping duties and 
other taxes and levies, including cost recovery charges, if relevant, will still be payable. 

Rules of Origin 

Goods will be Japanese originating goods if they satisfy the requirements of: 

  Division 1K of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act), as inserted by the 

Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement 
Implementation) Act 2014; and 

  Customs (Japanese Rules of Origin) Regulation 2014 (JAEPA Regulations). 

Division 1K sets out the ROO for the following categories of goods: 

  goods that are wholly obtained; 
  goods that are produced from originating materials only; and 
  goods produced from non-originating materials only or from non-originating materials 

and originating materials.

NO. 2015/01  

Renewal of Customs Broker Licences 

All customs broker licences will expire on 30 June 2015.  Those customs brokers wishing to 
renew their licence for the next triennium (i.e. from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2018) will need to 
apply for the renewal of their licence.   

Renewal Application 

In April 2015, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) will send the 
""Application for Renewal of Customs Brokers Licence"" package to each customs broker. 

To ensure that the renewal package is sent to the correct postal address, customs brokers 
should check, by no later than mid-March 2015, their contact details in the Integrated Cargo 
System (ICS) are up to date.  It is the responsibility of a customs broker to ensure that their 
contact details in the ICS are maintained.   

Completed renewal applications will be accepted up until close of business on Monday, 
29 June 2015 (the due date).  However, I recommend that customs brokers complete and 
return their renewal application as soon as possible after receiving the renewal package.   

Renewal applications received after the due date will not be processed.  As a consequence, the 
customs broker licences the subject of those renewal applications will expire on 30 June 2015. 

Renewal Fee 

Options for the payment of the renewal fee are listed on the invoice in the renewal package.  
Any customs broker electing to pay their renewal fee by cheque or BPay should take into 
account the delay in processing such payments and that such payments made towards the end 
of June 2015 may not be cleared by the due date.  Where a payment is not cleared by the due 
date, the renewal application will be considered to be incomplete and will not be processed.   

Continuing Professional Development  

It is a licence condition that a customs broker, who is a natural person, completes Continuing 
Professional Development (CPD) activities.  Customs brokers who have been unable to 
complete the required CPD activities by 31 March 2015 are required to notify the ACBPS, by 
emailing brokers.licensing@customs.gov.au by no later than Tuesday, 14 April 2015.  Non-
compliance with this licence condition is a breach of the Customs Act 1901 and could result in 
suspension of the customs broker licence and/or the issue of an infringement notice.  

Licence Re-issue 

Once the renewal process has been completed, the ACBPS will send out new customs broker 
licences.  This may take some time due to the number of licences to be processed. 

Enquiries  concerning  this  notice  may  be  directed  to  Broker  Licensing  on  (02)  6275  5784  or 
brokers.licensing@customs.gov.au.

Review of the Harmonized Customs Tariff 

The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System) is a 
multipurpose international product nomenclature developed by the World Customs Organization 
(WOO). The system is used by more than 200 countries and economies, including Australia, as 
a basis for their Customs tariffs and for the collection of international trade statistics. Over 98 
per cent of the merchandise in international trade is classified using the HS. 

In order to keep pace with developments in technology and changes in international trading 
patterns, the Harmonized System is regularly reviewed and amended, with major updates 
implemented every five years. 

The WCO is commencing work on the 6th  Review Cycle, the results of which are scheduled to 
be operative on and from 1 January 2022. 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is seeking input to assist with 
developing the Australian agenda of submissions to the WCO. This is an opportunity for users 
of the Harmonized System to influence changes that will better reflect current trading patterns 
and technologies. 

Interested parties wishing to make submissions are invited to do so no later than 28 February 
2015. Submissions should be addressed to —

2015/04 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – 2 February 2015 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released the December Quarter 2014 Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) figures on 28 January 2015.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in 
section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), the rates of excise-equivalent 
customs duty on certain spirits, beer and petroleum products including gaseous fuels will 
increase on 2 February 2015.  This Notice sets out the new rates of excise-equivalent customs 
duty in Table 1 and excise duty in Table 2. 

The new rates of excise-equivalent customs duty and excise duty listed in Tables 1 and 2 are 
calculated by multiplying the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is 
calculated by dividing the most recent CPI number, that is, the December Quarter 2014 number, 
by the previous highest December or June Quarter number occurring after the June Quarter 
1983.  

Accordingly, the December Quarter 2014 index number (106.6) has been divided by the 
June Quarter 2014 index number (105.9) to establish an indexation factor of 1.007. As this 
factor is greater than one, rates of excise-equivalent customs duty and excise duty are 
increased by the application of this factor. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in Schedule 5 (US 
originating goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), 
Schedule 8 (AANZ originating goods), Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods), Schedule 10 
(Korean originating goods) and Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods) in the Customs 
Tariff. 

Note that as outlined in ACN 2014/53 the indexed excise and excise-equivalent customs duty 
for fuels (excluding aviation fuels) will be rounded to three decimal places of a dollar.  This 
change is to simplify the fuel tax credit claim calculation. 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) has arranged for the 
publication of a Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty Notice (No. 1) 2015 in the 
Commonwealth Gazette on 2 February 2015.

Customs Regulation 2015 – Exposure Draft 

The exposure draft of the Customs Regulation 2015 remakes the Customs Regulations 1926, 
which are due to sunset on 1 April 2015.  

 http://www.customs.gov.au/businesses/Customs-Regulation-2015.asp 

The exposure draft proposes changes to the Customs Regulations 1926 to significantly improve 
its operation, including repealing redundant provisions, simplifying language and restructuring 
provisions that are difficult to navigate. Other minor changes to the Regulations have been 
made. Further details are contained in the Explanatory Statement. 

Industry and the community’s views are sought on the draft Customs Regulation 2015. 

Why are these changes necessary? 

The Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (LIA) provides that all legislative instruments, other than 
exempt instruments, progressively ‘sunset’ according to the timetable set out in the LIA. The 
purpose of this process is to ensure that a suitable review mechanism exist so that legislative 
instruments remain fit-for-purpose, necessary and relevant.  

A separate instrument, called the Customs (International Obligations) Regulation 2015 is 
currently being prepared and will also be released shortly for consultation. This Regulation will 
complement the Customs Regulation 2015 and covers the customs provisions related to 
Australia’s international obligations.  These provisions are exempt any future sunsetting 
requirements and this is best facilitated by placing them in a separate instrument.  

Have your say 

We are now inviting comments from industry, peak industry bodies or other interested parties. 
This input will be used to inform the final Customs Regulation 2015.  

Submissions can be emailed to regulationsreview@customs.gov.au 

Submissions close midnight Wednesday 25 February 2015.  

Please note that the purpose of this consultation is to improve the operation of the regulations. It 
is not to introduce substantive changes to existing government policy. Any feedback outside the 
specified scope will not be considered as part of this process due to the need to remake the 
instrument before the 1 April 2015 deadline. However, any feedback regarding more 
substantive reform may be considered after 1 April 2015.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the average weekly ordinary time earnings 
(AWOTE) for the December Quarter 2014 on 26 February 2015.  In accordance with the 
indexation provisions in section 19AB of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), the rates 
of excise-equivalent customs duty and excise duties on tobacco and tobacco products will 
increase on 3 March 2015.  This Notice sets out the new rates in Tables 1 and 2. 

The indexation factor is worked out by dividing the most recent AWOTE number by the highest 
AWOTE number for a previous June or December Quarter that does not precede the 
December Quarter 2012.  

Accordingly, the December Quarter 2014 number (1477.00) has been divided by the 
June Quarter 2014 number (1454.10) to establish an indexation factor of 1.016. As this factor is 
greater than one, rates of excise-equivalent customs duty and excise duty are increased by the 
application of this indexation factor. The calculation formula is: 

Tobacco duty rate 
on the day before     ×     1.016     

These increased rates also apply to tobacco and tobacco products in Schedule 5 (US 
originating goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), 
Schedule 8 (AANZ originating goods), Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods), Schedule 10 
(Korean originating goods) and Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods) in the Customs 
Tariff. 

On 6 November 2013, the Government announced it would proceed with a series of four 
12.5 per cent increases in excise and excise-equivalent customs duty for tobacco and tobacco 
products. The first two increases were applied on 1 December 2013 and 1 September 2014, 
further 12.5 per cent increases in excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco 
products will apply from 1 September 2015 and 1 September 2016. This increase is referred to 
as the “additional factor” in section 19AB of the Customs Tariff. The additional factor does not 
apply on the indexation of certain excise-equivalent customs and excise duty rates for tobacco 
and tobacco products for the March Quarter in 2015.  

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will arrange for the publication of a 
Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty Notice (No.2) 2015 in the Commonwealth Gazette 
on or as soon as practical after 3 March 2015.

Border Protection Service 

AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE NO. 
2015/09 

Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2014 

The Major Sporting Events (lndicia and Images) Protection Act 2014 (the Act) was introduced in July 2014 to 
protect indicia (for example signs, indications or distinguishing marks) and images associated with certain major 
sporting events that the Australian Government has committed to support. 

Import provisions within the Act permit a rights holder or authorised user of indicia and images to object to the 
unauthorised use of protected indicia and images on goods imported into Australia. Section 25 of the Act gives 
the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) the power to seize goods in cases where it is 
suspected that the user of protected indicia and images is not authorised to do so. The ACBPS will manage the 
import provisions through the existing Notice of Objection Scheme. 

Notice of Objection to Importation 

A Notice of Objection can be lodged at any time by a rights holder or authorised user (objector) under section 23 
of the Act. The Notice of Objection will have effect in relation to imported goods bearing protected indicia and 
images associated with a major sporting event, where the use of the indicia and images by the designated 
owner is not authorised. Once accepted by the ACBPS, and unless revoked, a Notice of Objection will remain in 
force for that event's protection period, as defined by the Act. 

The legislative scheme does not provide for the seizure of goods which are imported for personal use and not 
intended to be used for commercial purposes. It is important to note that the seizure powers are drawn directly 
from section 25 of the Act and should not be confused with the more general seizure provisions relating to 
customs search and seizure contained in the Customs Act 1901. 

The ACBPS is required by law to seize the imported goods unless there are no reasonable grounds for 
believing that the Act would be contravened. 

The following three events are covered in the Act, and designated owners/importers should make themselves 
aware of any Notices of Objection in place with the ACBPS in relation to those events: 

•  Asian Cup 2015 
•  Cricket World Cup 2015 
•  Gold Coast Commonwealth Games 2018 

Additional major sporting events may also be added to the Act at any time. 

Notice of Seizure 

Following the seizure of goods suspected of bearing protected indicia and images without authorisation, the 
ACBPS will issue a written notification (Notice of Seizure) identifying the goods and stating that the goods have 
been seized to both the designated owner and objector. 

Claim for Release of Goods 

If a designated owner considers there to be suitable grounds for the release of their seized goods, they may 
make a claim to have the goods released by the ACBPS. A claim for the release of goods must be submitted to 
the ACBPS within 10 working days from the day the Notice of Seizure was issued.

NOTICE NO. 2015/10 

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 2015-2016 

In early June 2015, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will contact cheese 
and curd quota holders to discuss quota allocations for 2015-2016. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the actual use of quota by 
that importer in the 23-month period ending 31 May 2015, as shown in Customs’ records of 
Import Declarations lodged between 01 July 2013 and 31 May 2015. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the 
quota allocated, importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese 
or curd by the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of 
that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian 
goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, 
then quota cannot be used.  Similarly, if preference circumstances or Free Trade Agreements 
(FTAs) apply, then quota is not available.  

The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a) 
(b) 

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with Customs; and   
the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port 
or airport at which any cargo is intended to be discharged. 

Please note that: 

• 

• 

The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer 
during the 23-month period or that remains unused at 31 May 2015. 

Quota used during the month of June 2014 will be taken into consideration for allocation 
2015-2016, but will NOT count in computations for 2016-2017.  This June ‘factor’ is 
repetitive for every annual allocation because of the 31 May import performance cut-off 
for calculation of following year’s allocations. 

At this time of the year, quota users and their brokers should take stock of quota balances with 
a view to maximising usage and consequently maximising their next allocation. 

We will publish the final allocation in the Commonwealth of Australia: Tariff Concessions 
Gazette in July 2015.

NO. 2015/14  

Commencement of the New Customs Regulation 2015 and 
Customs (International Obligations) Regulation 2015 

The Customs Regulation 2015 (2015 Regulation) and Customs (International Obligations) 
Regulation 2015 (International Obligations Regulation) take effect from 1 April 2015. These 
regulations remake the Customs Regulations 1926 (the 1926 Regulations), which sunset on the 
same date. 

The new regulations have undergone changes to significantly improve their operation including 
repealing redundant provisions, simplifying language and restructuring provisions that were 
difficult to navigate in the 1926 Regulations.  Exposure drafts of the new regulations were 
published earlier in 2015 (Australian Customs and Border Protection Notices 2015/05 and 
2015/07 refer). 

Provisions relating to Australia’s international obligations including Free Trade Agreements, 
Duty Drawback Scheme and Dumping and Counterveiling measures are contained in the 
International Obligations Regulation.  These provisions are exempt from sunsetting 
requirements and have been placed in a separate instrument to ensure that they are not subject 
to sunsetting in the future.   

The 2015 Regulation and the International Obligations Regulation can be found on the ComLaw 
website.  

Why are these changes necessary? 

The Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (LIA) provides that all legislative instruments, other than 
exempt instruments, progressively ‘sunset’ according to the relevant table set out in the LIA. 
The purpose of this is to ensure that a suitable review mechanism exists so that legislative 
instruments remain relevant, necessary and fit-for-purpose. The relevant table provides that any 
legislative instrument made a year before 1930 is to sunset on 1 April 2015.  As such it was 
necessary to re-make the 1926 Regulations to ensure that relevant provisions continued post  
1 April 2015.   

What does this mean for me? 

In keeping with the scope of the LIA sunsetting exercise, the new regulations do not introduce 
any substantive changes to existing government policy.  

What you will notice is that the regulations have a different look and feel to the 1926 
Regulations. Sections and numbering within the 1926 Regulations have necessarily been 
restructured and the contents split into two instruments as part of the process to enhance its 
overall operation.  

To assist you to become familiar with the new format, explanatory statements about the 2015 
Regulation and the International Obligations Regulation are available.  Finding tables are also 
available indicating the location of sections from the previous 1926 Regulations within the 
remade regulations and vice versa.

NO. 2015/17 

Customs Brokers Licensing - Acquired Experience 

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) has received enquiries about 
the status of a pass in a national examination or assessment as one element in establishing that 
the applicant has “acquired experience that fits them to be a Customs Broker”. Those enquires 
were from persons considering making an application for a customs broker licence. 

Acquired Experience 

The CEO of Customs is required to consider whether an applicant for a customs broker licence 
(nominee or sole trader) is:  

  a fit and proper person; and 
  qualified to be a customs broker. 

To be qualified to be a customs broker, a person needs to have: 

 

completed (or be exempted from completing) an approved course of study or instruction; 
and 

  acquired experience that, in the opinion of the CEO, fits the person to be a customs broker. 

Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice (ACBPN) No. 2013/21, in addressing 
“acquired experience” stated among other things: 

A number of organisations may conduct an examination that assists applicants 
who have completed (or been exempted from) the approved course of study in 
demonstrating that they have the knowledge required of a customs broker.  The 
CEO may take into account the successful completion of such an examination 
when assessing whether an applicant has acquired experience that fits them to 
be a customs broker.  The weight afforded to successful completion of any 
particular examination from time to time will depend upon a number of factors 
including: 

  how well it is perceived to test practical experience and not simply academic 

knowledge 

 

 

the breadth of the range of practical issues that it tests and the depth of 
experience that it requires to resolve these issues, and 
the rigour with which the examination is conducted. 

The most important element of demonstrating acquired experience is 
nevertheless the applicant’s employment history as detailed in the 
documentation supporting their application.  While successfully completing an 
examination can be an additional element in demonstrating acquired 
experience, it is not mandatory nor is it sufficient in itself. 

Further details on acquired experience for customs broker licence applications can 
be found at: http://www.customs.gov.au/site/BrokerApplication.asp.  Select 
“Nominee” then document 3 “Guidelines for Acquired Experience for Nominee 
Customs Broker Licence Applications”.

New website – border.gov.au 

From 1 July 2015, The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) will 
integrate with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) and the 
Australian Border Force (ABF) will be established. 

To support the integration, a new website will be launched at www.border.gov.au. From this 
date, internet searches for the immi.gov.au and customs.gov.au homepages will be indefinitely 
redirected to the new address. 

Design 

The new site has been developed in close consultation with industry stakeholders to ensure 
relevant information is easily accessible. The website will have a new look and feel and will be 
optimised for mobile devices.  

Content 

The new website will combine information from the Department and ACBPS websites and 
include new information about the ABF. 

Extensive user research informed the development of the website. Workshops were conducted 
with a diverse range of stakeholder groups including staff, industry, importers, visa applicants, 
citizenship applicants, businesses and migration agents. Based on research findings, 
information pathways and content have been reorganised to put users first. A prominent search 
feature and drop-down mega menus make information easier to find.  

Some other websites owned by the Department will remain in their current form. The Translating 
and Interpreting Service website will remain at its current web address and content will not 
change. The Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority website will be updated to 
reflect the new brand of the Department but will continue to be located at its current web 
address. 

Content from www.citizenship.gov.au and www.cargosupport.gov.au will be moved to 
www.border.gov.au. A redirect from the www.cargosupport.gov.au homepage only will take 
users to relevant cargo support content on the new site. The Minister’s and Assistant Minister’s 
websites will be moved to the border.gov.au domain, however content will not change. 

There will be ongoing updates to the website after 1 July 2015.

No.2015/26 

Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates – 1 August 2015 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released the June Quarter 2015 Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
figures on 22 July 2015.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in section 19 of the Customs 
Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), the rates of excise-equivalent customs duty on certain spirits, beer and 
petroleum products including gaseous fuels will increase on 1 August 2015.  This Notice sets out the 
new rates of excise-equivalent customs duty in Table 1 and excise duty in Table 2. 

The new rates of excise-equivalent customs duty and excise duty listed in Tables 1 and 2 are calculated 
by multiplying the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by 
dividing the most recent CPI number, that is, the June Quarter 2015 number, by the previous highest 
December or June Quarter number occurring after the June Quarter 1983.  

Accordingly, the June Quarter 2015 index number (107.5) has been divided by the December Quarter 
2014 index number (106.6) to establish an indexation factor of 1.008. As this factor is greater than one, 
rates of excise-equivalent customs duty and excise duty are increased by the application of this factor. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in Schedule 5 (US originating 
goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), Schedule 8 
(AANZ originating goods), Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods), Schedule 10 (Korean originating 
goods) and Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods) in the Customs Tariff. 

Note that as outlined in Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice 2014/53 the indexed excise 
and excise-equivalent customs duty for fuels (excluding aviation fuels) will be rounded to three decimal 
places of a dollar.  This change is to simplify the fuel tax credit claim calculation. 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) has arranged for the 
publication of a Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty Notice (No.3) 2015 in the Commonwealth 
Gazette on 1 August 2015.

No.2015/27 

Declaration of asbestos in certain children's toys 

The importation of asbestos or goods containing asbestos into Australia without permission is prohibited 
under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. The onus is upon the importer to ensure all 
border requirements are met for goods containing asbestos. 

To assist in the identification at the border of certain toys at risk of being manufactured with asbestos, or 
components containing asbestos, a Community Protection Question will be required to be answered upon 
lodgement of shipments containing children's crayons and toys in sets, with Country of Origin: China (CN). 

The importation of asbestos is permitted under the following limited circumstances: 

• 

• 

the goods are raw materials that contain naturally occurring traces of asbestos; or 

the goods are 'hazardous waste' as defined in the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and 
Imports) Act 1989, or 

•  ministerial exemptionl  is granted and confirmed in accordance with relevant Commonwealth of 

Australia law in respect to workplace health and safety, and the goods are for research, analysis or 
display, or 

• 

the importation is from the Australian Antarctic Territory 

Where an exemption is granted, the valid written exemption must be produced to a Collector at the border. 

For exemption application information contact the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency (ASEA) at 
email: enquiriesasbestossafety.gov.au. 

Industry enquiries regarding ICS entry issues resulting from this new question should be directed to Cargo 
Support at email: carqosupportborder.qov.au.

No.2015/28 

Increase to Commonwealth penalty unit value from $170 to $180 

On 31 July 2015, the value of a Commonwealth penalty unit increased from $170 to $180. This means that 
the maximum financial penalties for committing various Commonwealth offences also rose from this date. 
Under most Commonwealth laws, financial penalties are generally expressed in terms of ‘penalty units’ 
instead of dollar figures. As an example, a maximum fine would generally be expressed as ‘10 penalty 
units’ as opposed to a dollar value of $1,800. 

The increase to the Commonwealth penalty unit value is necessary to accommodate inflation since the 
value was last adjusted in 2012, to ensure that the real value of the penalty unit is maintained. Maintaining 
the value of the penalty unit in real terms ensures that financial penalties remain effective deterrents to 
the committing of Commonwealth offences. 

The new penalty unit value will only apply to offences committed on or after 31 July 2015. This means that 
the changes will not impact on current proceedings or offences that were committed before this date. Any 
fines imposed for offences committed before 31 July 2015 will be based on the value of the penalty unit at 
the time the offence was committed. The table below illustrates the change with examples that indicate 
the maximum penalty a court may impose and what will be imposed under the current Infringement 
Notice Scheme (INS) that came into effect on 1 February 2014.

No.2015/29 

Biannual Indexation of certain customs and excise duty rates for tobacco and 
tobacco products – 1 September 2015  

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) amount 
of June Quarter 2015 on 13 August 2015.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in section 19AB of 
the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), the rates of excise-equivalent customs and excise duties on 
tobacco and tobacco products will increase on 1 September 2015.  This Notice sets out the new rates in 
Tables 1 and 2. 

The indexation factor is worked out by dividing the most recent AWOTE amount by the highest AWOTE 
amount for a previous June or December quarter that does not precede the December quarter 2012.  

Accordingly, the June Quarter 2015 index number (1483.1) has been divided by the December Quarter 2014 
index number (1477.00) to establish an indexation factor of 1.004. As this factor is greater than one, rates of 
excise-equivalent customs duty and excise duty are increased by the application of this indexation factor.  

On 6 November 2013, the Government announced it would proceed with a series of four 12.5 per cent 
increases in excise and excise-equivalent customs duty for tobacco and tobacco products. The first increase 
was applied on 1 December 2013. Further increases apply from 1 September 2014, 1 September 2015 and  
1 September 2016. This increase is referred to as the “additional factor” in section 19AB of the Customs 
Tariff. The additional factor for 1 September 2015 is 1.125. This factor is then applied to the new indexed 
rates of excise-equivalent customs and excise duties on tobacco and tobacco products. The calculation 
formula is:  

Tobacco duty rate 
on the day before     ×     1.004    ×      1.125  
1 September 2015     

These increased rates also apply to tobacco and tobacco products listed in Schedule 5 (US originating 
goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), Schedule 8 (AANZ 
originating goods), Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods), Schedule 10 (Korean originating goods) and 
Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods) in the Customs Tariff. 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection will arrange for the publication of a Notice of 
Substituted Rates of Customs Duty Notice (No. 4) 2015 in the Commonwealth Gazette on 1 September 
2015.

No.2015/30 

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme - Allocations for 2015-2016  

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection advises that it has determined 2015-16 allocations under the 
Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme that it administers on behalf of the Department of Agriculture. The allocation was 
gazetted on 01 July 2015 in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette - Tariff Concessions No. 2015/25. 

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 23-month period 
ending 31 May 2015, as shown in departmental records of clearances for home consumption.  This calculation 
excludes any part of the quota that was transferred to another importer during the 23-month period or that was unused 
as at 31 May 2015.   

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, importers are 
required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the financial year to which the 
allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin 
(returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, 
preference circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), quota is unable to be used.  Because of the 
commencement of the Japanese and Korean FTAs, Japanese and Korean cheeses are no longer eligible for 
Cheese and Curd Quota. 

The cheese or curd is considered to be ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a) 
Protection, and   
(b) 

an entry for home consumption, which identifies item 55, for the goods is lodged with Immigration and Border 

the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port or airport for the 
discharge of cargo. 

Quota allocations are transferable between importers.  A person may apply to transfer quota entitlements by 
completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) available at http://www.border.gov.au .

No. 2015/35 

Commencement of customs licensing review 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) is undertaking a comprehensive public review 
of all customs licensing regimes provided for under the Customs Act 1901, that is, customs broker, depot and 
warehouse licences. 

Terms of reference and discussion paper 

Terms of reference and a discussion paper have now been released and are available from the Submissions and 
discussion papers webpage of the Department website. 

The objectives of the Review are to: 

 

review the role played by licensing in today’s border management environment and consider whether there 
are other, more efficient ways to achieve the same objectives for border management; 

  assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the current licensing regimes; 
  assess the regulatory burden of the current licensing regimes and identify opportunities to reduce this burden 

 

and align application processes between administrations; and 
recommend whether the current licensing regimes should be retained with improvements/enhancements or be 
replaced. 

Further details regarding the scope of the Review are set out in the terms of reference, however it will not include a 
review of the: 

 

fees and charges applicable to customs brokers, depots or warehouses as those were the subject of a 
separate review - the Joint Review of Border Fees, Charges and Taxes. It is recognised however, that 
changes to the licensing regimes may result in changes to the cost base;  

  Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Scheme for customs brokers as the CPD Scheme was reviewed 

by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) in 2014; or 
cargo reporting requirements. 

 

Invitation to make a submission 

The Department invites all interested people and organisations to lodge a written submission. The discussion paper 
provides further details on how to provide a submission, and covers a range of issues on which the Department seeks 
information and feedback.  

During the course of the review there will also be opportunities for further consultation on submissions where 
necessary, and for individuals and organisations to provide comments on draft recommendations prior to the 
finalisation of the review. 

Given the scope of the Review we request that separate written submissions be lodged for each licence type, that 
is, depot, warehouse or customs broker licences. Each submission should be accompanied by a separate submission 
cover sheet and emailed to licensingreview@border.gov.au by 5pm AEDST Thursday 31 December 2015. 

Any queries regarding the Review or how to make a submission should be emailed to licensingreview@border.gov.au

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2015-38.pdf,Building products at risk of containing asbestos,"DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 

No. 2015/38 

Building products at risk of containing asbestos 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection assesses all goods imported into Australia against a 
number of risks, including asbestos. Goods at risk of containing asbestos are targeted by the Australian 
Border Force (ABF) for compliance and enforcement action. 

To ensure the ongoing safety of Australian consumers and construction industry members, the Department 
of Immigration and Border Protection is actively targeting imported building products at high risk of 
containing asbestos.  

The Department urges industry members to ensure they are aware of the import restrictions and border 
requirements for products that may contain asbestos.  

An Australia wide ban on the importation, manufacture and use of all types of asbestos and products 
containing asbestos took effect on 31 December 2003. Import restrictions complement state and territory 
work health and safety laws that prohibit the supply, transport, use, or handling of asbestos unless an 
exception applies.  

Despite the restrictions, asbestos has been detected in a diverse range of imported building products, 
including Expanded Polystyrene Sandwich (EPS) panels and similar products of fibre/cement compound 
board, bitumen products used for damp-proofing, heat resistant sealing and caulking compounds, heating 
equipment, lagging, switchgear with washers, electrical panel partitioning, electrical cloths and tape. 

Imported building products at risk of containing asbestos  

Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral fibre, still widely used in some countries due to its flexibility, 
tensile strength, insulation quality, chemical inertness and affordability. In a number of countries, unlike 
Australia, there are few to no restrictions in the use and supply of asbestos. Local standards in some 
countries may even classify goods as ‘asbestos-free’ where they meet a certain low level of asbestos 
content. In Australia, a product found with any level of asbestos is prohibited for import or use. Importers 
should be aware of the varying definitions and standards applied in the country of origin and/or supply. 
Many products containing asbestos can be freely ordered on the internet and will often claim to be 
asbestos-free. 

As a consequence, asbestos can be unintentionally and unknowingly imported into Australia. 

What can be done to ensure imported building products do not contain asbestos? 

The onus is on importers to ensure they do not bring prohibited imports such as asbestos into Australia. All 
goods imported into Australia are risk assessed and if there is a suspicion that goods arriving at the border 
might contain asbestos, the goods are detained and documentation will be requested.

No. 2015/39 

Consultation on international standards and risk assessments 

The Australian Government has published the Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda: An Action Plan for a 
Stronger Australia (the agenda). In response to the agenda, the Government is adopting the principle that if a 
system, service or product has been approved under a trusted international standard or risk assessment, then 
Australian regulators should not impose any additional requirements, unless there is a good and demonstrable 
reason to do so. 

Consultation 

The Department is seeking input from our external stakeholders regarding the criteria and processes it will use to 
determine whether international standards and risk assessments are suitable for use in Australia. The Department 
will consider submissions on this topic prior to publishing the final criteria. 

Invitation to make a submission 

You are invited to make submissions on the draft criteria and to discuss other issues the Department might 
consider when engaging with trusted international standards and risk assessments.  

You should consider and address the following questions in your submissions:  

  Are the criteria sufficient for the Department to appropriately consider accepting international standards 

and risk assessments in Australia?  

  Are there other factors the Department should take into consideration?  

The submission deadline is 14 December 2015.  

Our preferred method of receiving submissions is via email to deregulation@border.gov.au  

Alternatively, mail your submission to:

No. 2015/40 

Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 – 
Firearms and Weapons 

The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment (Firearms and Other Weapons) Regulation 2015 (Amendment 
Regulation) has now become law. This Amendment Regulation affects the lawful importation of certain firearms and 
weapons in certain circumstances under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the PI Regulations).  

The changes to the PI Regulations are mostly deregulatory to improve the defence and law enforcement industries’ 
ability to source specialised goods for use in the production of defence and law enforcement goods or supply to 
defence and law enforcement agencies. Some other changes will affect individuals who import some of the goods 
for personal use, such as individuals who are collectors or operate military museums. 

Strict governance arrangements remain in place to ensure that only those with a lawful need to import firearms, 
weapons and associated parts, and components into Australia are able to do so provided they meet certain 
conditions and requirements. 

Major changes 

The major changes to the PI Regulations include: 

 

Import permission will no longer be required for the following: 
o  Schedule 13 goods imported for the purposes of transhipment (Regulation 3D). 
o  The re-importation of firearms used in lawful shooting or hunting activities overseas by Australian 

residents (subject to conditions in new Regulation 3E). 

o  Eligible Schedule 13 goods imported by Australian Community members of the Australia-United States 

Defence Trade Cooperation Treaty (new Regulation 3F).  

  Adjustable, detachable and folding stocks are now defined under ‘firearm part’ rather than ‘firearm 

accessory’, impacting on which ‘tests’ are applied to these goods. 

  Anti-personnel sprays and chemicals are removed from Schedule 3 and are now classified under new Item 45 

of Schedule 13. 
o  This allows these goods to be treated consistently with other Schedule 13 weapons, such as the 

requirement for importers to meet one of the applicable ‘tests’ to import these goods. 

  Military vehicles, aircraft and vessels within the categories of battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, 

combat aircraft, attack helicopters and warships are now controlled under new Item 1A of Schedule 13.  
o  This ensures that offensive military vehicles, aircraft and vessels that contain weapons are controlled on 
import. It also ensures that civilian dual-use parts and components which are unrelated to weapons 
(such as axles, engine parts, gearboxes, rotors etc.) can be imported without a permit. 

Weapons, weapons parts and components that can be affixed to any type of vehicle, aircraft and vessel 
remain controlled under Item 1 of Schedule 13.

NOTICE NO. 2015/41 

China–Australia Free Trade Agreement – Rules of Origin 

The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) was signed in Canberra 
on 17 June 2015 by the Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb and 
Chinese Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng.  

ChAFTA will enter into force on 20 December 2015. On entry into force 
importers will be entitled to duty-free entry or a reduced rate of tariff for goods 
imported from the People’s Republic of China (China). To be eligible for duty-
free entry or a reduced rate of tariff, goods must meet the ChAFTA rules of 
origin (ROOs).  

This Notice summarises the rules for determining whether a good originates in 
China for the purposes of ChAFTA. 

‘Free’ rates of customs duty 

The Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), as amended by the Customs 
Tariff Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Act 
2015 (the Act), will allow duty free entry of many Chinese originating goods 
when ChAFTA is implemented. Preferential treatment will apply to Chinese 
originating goods that are imported on or after the day ChAFTA enters into 
force, or to goods imported before that day and entered for home consumption 
on or after that day. 

Other duties and taxes 

While most Chinese originating goods will be eligible for ‘Free’ rates of customs 
duty, other duties and taxes such as excise-equivalent duties, goods and 
services tax, dumping/countervailing duties and other taxes and levies, 
including cost recovery charges, if relevant, will still be payable. 

Rules of origin 

Goods will be Chinese originating goods if they satisfy the requirements of: 

•

(Customs Act), as inserted by the Act; and

No. 2015/44 

From 1 January 2016, Import Processing Charges (IPCs) will be restructured and implemented 
under the Import Processing Charges Amendment Act 2015. 

These changes were announced by the Government as part of the 2015-2016 Commonwealth 
Budget. The restructured IPCs are cost recovery based and are aimed at improving the integrity of 
the border while removing cross-subsidisation and delivering efficiencies to industry. 

The changes to take effect from 1 January 2016 will remove the current price differential between 
air, sea and post cargo pathways and are detailed in the following table:

No. 2016/01 

Contact details in the Integrated Cargo System 

To avoid unnecessary delays in the clearance of goods, it is important that client contact 
details in the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) are correct.   

Ensuring client contact details are correct makes it easier for us to contact the relevant party 
to resolve any issues related to a consignment. 

Client register 

The ICS holds information on all clients who have been registered. The system also allows 
you to update your own contact information and that of your clients.  

If contact details are out of date it can be difficult to contact the relevant party, which may 
result in delaying clearance when there are queries related to a consignment. 

Ensure client contact details are up to date  

To help us clear goods as quickly as possible, please ensure client contact information in the 
ICS is up to date, including your nominated Primary Contact. Of particular importance are the 
following fields: 

  Name (individual or business) 
  Telephone number, landline and mobile 
  Business address 
  Email address 

When reviewing your details please remove any duplicates, which may have occurred due to 
minor variations in client names or addresses. Also, be aware that you may have to update 
contact information at the Client Role and Client Establishment levels as they are separate 
from the Client Summary level. 

More information on how to register, add or amend contact details in the ICS can be found at 
Cargo Support FAQs.

No.2016/02 

Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods  
on 1 February 2016 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released the December Quarter 2015 Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) figures on 27 January 2016.  In accordance with the indexation provisions in section 19 of 
the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), the customs duty rates on certain excise-equivalent goods 
including spirits, beer and petroleum products, in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff, will increase on 
1 February 2016.  This Notice sets out the new customs duty rates for excise-equivalent goods (Table 1) 
and excise duty rates (Table 2). 

The new customs duty rates for excise-equivalent goods and excise duty rates are calculated by 
multiplying the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing 
the most recent CPI number, that is, the December Quarter 2015 number, by the previous highest June 
or December Quarter number occurring after the June Quarter 1983.  

Accordingly, the December Quarter 2015 index number (108.4) has been divided by the 
June Quarter 2015 index number (107.5) to establish an indexation factor of 1.008. As this factor is 
greater than one, rates of duty for excise and excise-equivalent goods will be increased by the 
application of this factor. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in Schedule 5 (US originating 
goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), Schedule 8 
(ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand originating goods), Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods), 
Schedule 10 (Korean originating goods), Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods) and Schedule 12 
(Chinese originating goods) in the Customs Tariff. 

As outlined in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection Notice 2014/53 the indexed rates 
for excise and excise-equivalent fuels (excluding aviation fuels) will be rounded to three decimal places 
of a dollar.  This change is to simplify the fuel tax credit claim calculation. 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) has arranged for the 
publication of a Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty Notice (No.1) 2016 in the Gazette on  
1 February 2016.

No.2016/05 

Biannual indexation of customs duty rates for certain tobacco and  
tobacco products – 1 March 2016  

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) 
amount for the December Quarter 2015 on 25 February 2016.  In accordance with the indexation 
provisions in section 19AB of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff Act), the customs duty rates on 
certain tobacco and tobacco products, in Schedule 3 of the Tariff Act, will increase on 1 March 2016.  
This Notice sets out the new customs duty rates for excise-equivalent goods (Table 1) and excise duty 
rates (Table 2). 

The new customs duty rates for excise-equivalent goods and excise duty rates are calculated by 
multiplying the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing 
the most recent AWOTE amount, i.e. the December Quarter 2015 amount, by the previous highest June 
or December Quarter that does not precede the December Quarter 2012.  

Accordingly, the December Quarter 2015 amount (1500.50) has been divided by the June Quarter 2015 
amount (1483.10) to establish an indexation factor of 1.012. As this factor is greater than one, rates of 
excise-equivalent customs duty and excise duty are increased by the application of this indexation 
factor.  

Tobacco duty rate on the day 
before the indexation day 

×     1.012     

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in Schedule 5 (US originating 
goods), Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods), Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods), Schedule 8 
(ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand originating goods), Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods), 
Schedule 10 (Korean originating goods), Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods) and Schedule 12 
(Chinese originating goods) in the Tariff Act. 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection will arrange for the publication of a Notice of 
Substituted Rates of Customs Duty for Excise-Equivalent Goods Notice (No. 2) 2016 in the 
Commonwealth Gazette on 1 March 2016.

No. 2016/09 

Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940 – Deferral of Sunsetting Date 

On 21 March 2016, the Attorney-General’s decision to defer the sunsetting date for the Commerce 
(Imports) Regulations 1940 (CI Regulations) was notified on the Federal Register of Legislation. The 
expiration date for the CI Regulations was deferred to 1 April 2017.  

The  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Border  Protection  sought  this  deferral  on  the  basis  that  the  
CI Regulations could not be remade before the sunsetting date, due to unforseen and unavoidable 
circumstances.  These  circumstances  were  the  extended  timeframes  to  implement  the  Australian 
Government’s broader reforms for the Country of Origin Labelling (CoOL) framework for food. These 
reforms  require  the  CI  Regulations,  which  cover  food  imports,  to  be  amended.  The  deferral  will 
ensure  the  remade  CI  Regulations  give  effect  to  these  reforms.  This  will  minimise  disruption  to 
stakeholders  and  streamline  the  regulatory  process.  The  CI  Regulations  will  be  remade  once  the 
CoOL reforms are implemented (in the second half of 2016).     

In  late  2015, the  Department of  Immigration and  Border Protection  (the  Department)  reviewed  the  
CI Regulations to identify any redundant provisions and deregulation opportunities. This review was 
subject to a public consultation process. Submissions made to this process will be considered when 
the CI Regulations are remade.  

Background 

The  CI  Regulations  ensure  that  the  Australian  Border  Force  (ABF)  can  enforce  labelling 
requirements for a range of goods, including food, at the Australian  border. The Commerce (Trade 
Descriptions) Act 1905 and the CI Regulations give ABF officers the power to inspect and examine 
imports to determine accurate trade descriptions, including country of origin, have been applied.  

The existing CI Regulations will continue in force until they are remade or they expire (in April 2017). 
Until this occurs, there is no change to the requirements for imported goods to be labelled.  

Further information  

Further  information  about  the  CI  Regulations  is  available  on  the  Department’s  website  at 
www.border.gov.au.

No.2016/10 

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 2016-2017 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) will shortly contact Cheese and Curd Quota 
Scheme holders to discuss quota allocations for 2016-2017. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 23-
month period ending 31 May 2016, as shown in the Department’s records of Import Declarations lodged between 01 
July 2014 and 31 May 2016. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, importers 
are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the financial year to which 
the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin 
(returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, then 
the quota cannot be used.  Similarly, if preference circumstances or Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) apply, then the 
quota is not available.  

The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if:   

(a) 
(b) 

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with the Department; and   
the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port or airport at which any 
cargo is intended to be discharged. 

Please note that: 

• 

• 

The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer during the 23-month 
period or that remains unused at 31 May 2016. 

Quota used during the month of June 2015 will be taken into consideration for allocation 2016-2017, but will 
NOT count in computations for 2016-2017.  This June ‘factor’ is repetitive for every annual allocation because 
of the 31 May import performance cut-off for calculation of following year’s allocations. 

At this time of the year, quota users and their brokers should take stock of quota balances with a view to optimising 
usage and consequently optimising their next allocation for their needs. 

We will publish the final allocation in the Commonwealth of Australia: Tariff Concessions Gazette in July 2016. 

Where you anticipate quota usage shortfalls, there is an option to transfer allocations between importers.  You can 
apply for a transfer by completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) and submitting it to: 

Director Industry Assistance 
Department of Immigration and Border Protection 
6 Chan Street 
BELCONNEN   ACT   2617 

Alternatively, this form may be submitted by email to Industry Assistance at tarcon@border.gov.au. 

Transfer requests are processed in order of their receipt.  Each request may take up to four working days to process.  
The transfer form is available on the Department’s website at 
https://www.border.gov.au/Forms/Documents/b235.pdf#search=B235.

No. 2016/11 

Revised timeframe for the customs licensing review 

On 2 November 2015, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) announced a 
comprehensive public review of all customs licensing regimes provided for under the Customs Act 1901, that is, 
customs broker, depot and warehouse licences. See Australian Customs Notice 2015/35 for more information on the 
Review. 

We released the terms of reference and a discussion paper on the Submissions and discussion papers webpage and 
included a timeframe for conducting the Review. The initial timeframes indicated the draft recommendations will be 
released in mid-April 2016 and the final recommendations will be released by 30 June 2016.  

We have received 37 submissions raising a large number of issues and expressing varying views. We appreciate the 
input received from stakeholders and are looking forward to further collaboration and working through the complex 
information. 

Therefore, we have extended the timeframes originally published in the Terms of Reference. The draft 
recommendations will now be released on 11 July 2016 and the final report will be submitted to the Comptroller-
General of Customs on 31 August 2016.  

The extended timeframe will allow us to better address the wide range of complex issues and recommendations in a 
comprehensive manner. This will provide both industry and us with further opportunities to collaborate on 
recommendations.  

Any queries regarding the Review including the revised timeframe should be emailed to 
licensingreview@border.gov.au.

Department of Immigration 
and Border Protection 

DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 

No. 2016/15 

New Import Prohibition — Signal Jammers 

On 10 May 2016, a new border control to prohibit the importation of signal jammers will commence. 
This follows the Federal Executive Council's endorsement of amendments to the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. Effective from 10 May 2016, signal jammers' imports will be 
prohibited unless a domestic exemption applies. The import prohibition will complement the existing 
domestic prohibition for these goods. 

Background 

Signal jammers can prevent or disrupt mobile phone and satellite navigation services. The 
prohibited device must be a device that: 

is designed to have an adverse effect on radiocommunications; or 

• 
•  would be likely to substantially: 

interfere with radiocommunications; or 

o 
o  disrupt or disturb radiocommunications in any other way; or 

• 

is a radiocommunications transmitter, or a radiocommunications receiver, that would be 
reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the health or safety of persons who: 

o  operate the device; or 
o  work on the device; or 
o  use services supplied by means of the device; or 
o  are reasonably likely to be affected by the operation of the device. 

Signal jammers are prohibited for domestic use in Australia by operation of section 190 of the 
Radiocommunications Act 1992, administered by the Australian Communications and Media 
Authority (ACMA). 

Once the new import prohibition for signal jammers commences, the Australian Border Force will be 
able to seize these goods at the border. Importing these prohibited goods may lead to penalties and 
prosecution. 

Further information 

•  Further information about the new border control can be obtained at the Department's 

website https://www.border.qov.au/Busi/Impo/Proh.  

•  Further information about signal jamming devices can be obtained at ACMA's website

No. 2016/16 

Approved course of study for a customs broker’s licence 

This Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) Notice provides information on the new course of study 
that will need to be completed by anyone wishing to apply for a customs broker’s licence.  

This DIBP Notice supersedes Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice 2014/22 and other previous notices 
dealing with the approved course of study for a customs broker’s licence.  

Section 183CC of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) requires the Comptroller-General of Customs (Comptroller-General) 
to grant a broker’s licence only if, in his opinion, the applicant is a fit and proper person and is qualified to be a 
customs broker. A qualified customs broker, unless exempted by the Comptroller-General, completes an approved 
course of study or instruction and has acquired experience that fits them to be a customs broker.  

In 2015, a standard review of the Diploma of Customs Broking TLI50813 was undertaken by the Australian Industry 
Standards. As a result of that review, certain units that form the approved course of study have now been re-named 
as part of the Training Package Review. The content of the newly named units has remained effectively the same and 
the quantum of units comprising the approved course of study (18) is unchanged.  

As a result of those changes, the Comptroller-General has approved a new course of study for a customs broker’s 
licence. The new course of study is the Diploma of Customs Broking TLI50816. Details of the Diploma, including the 
units of study that comprise the Diploma, are available at: https://training.gov.au/Training/Details/TLI50816. 

Some of the units that were amended include: 

-  TLIX0001 Determine tariff classification of goods (previously TLIX5051A Determine tariff classification of 

goods); 

-  TLIX0002 Initiate cargo border procedures (previously TLIX5057A Prepare documents for customs 

clearance); and 

-  TLIX0003 Conduct advanced border clearance functions (previously TLIX5059A Undertake border clearance 

functions). 

The changes include title changes to the units of competency, elements and performance criteria and a general 
rewrite of the unit to reflect current practices.  

For people undertaking the previous Diploma of Customs Broking TLI50813, Registered Training Organisations 
(RTOs) will allow students to finish and be awarded the qualification if they have remained enrolled and have 
completed all course requirements within the two year completion period for the Diploma. For students who have not 
completed the necessary course requirements within the two year completion period, RTOs will assist to transition 
them to complete the new Diploma of Customs Broking TLI50816. 

People who have completed a former approved course of study, should talk to their RTO for further advice regarding 
recognition of their prior study.   

Enquiries concerning this DIBP Notice should be directed to Broker Licensing on telephone number

Department of Immigration 
and Border Protection 

DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 

No. 2016/23 

Introduction of domestic mandatory safety standard: self-balancing scooters 
(hoverboards) 

On 14 July 2016, the Minister for Small Business and Assistant Treasurer (the Minister for Small 
Business), the Hon Kelly O'Dwyer MP, introduced a mandatory safety standard under the Australian 
Consumer Law for self-balancing scooters (also known as hoverboards) supplied in Australia. The 
mandatory standard took effect on 17 July 2016. Self-balancing scooters that do not meet safety 
requirements are not permitted for sale in Australia. The safety standard will be in place for two years. 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has no legislative powers to ensure that 
imported self-balancing scooters conform to electrical safety requirements. Self-balancing scooters 
are not a prohibited or restricted import. However, importers should be aware of the safety standard 
that applies to self-balancing scooters sold domestically in Australia. 

Background 

Self-balancing scooters are electrical two-wheeled ride on devices with no steering grips, seats or 
handlebars. They are powered by a lithium-ion battery that is rechargeable through connection to a 
main power supply. 

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), with relevant state and territory 
regulators are responsible for ensuring consumer goods comply with safety requirements. This 
includes self-balancing scooters sold in the Australian market. The Minister for Small Business, along 
with state and territory counterparts, is responsible for ensuring the safety of consumer goods sold 
domestically. 

Self-balancing scooters have been associated with a number of house fires in Australia since January 
2016. In response to safety concerns, the Minister for Small Business imposed an interim ban on 
self-balancing scooters that do not meet safety requirements. This followed advice from the ACCC on 
its findings during its safety investigation into self-balancing scooters and associated parts. The ban 
was extended twice and expired on 16 July 2016. The newly introduced mandatory safety standard 
has the same requirements as the interim ban. 

Further information 

Further information about the safety standard can be obtained on the ACCC's website

DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION 
NOTICE 

No.2016/24 

PROCESSING REFUND APPLICATIONS 

Purpose 

To articulate the Department of Immigration and Border Protection's (the Department's) policy 
position regarding the timely processing of duty refund applications. 

Policy 

An owner or an authorised agent acting on behalf of the owner may apply for a refund 
electronically through the Integrated Cargo System or by submitting a completed and signed 
Form B653 — Refund Application. 

The Department must satisfy itself that a refund application meets all of the relevant requirements 
before a refund is approved. This may include requesting additional information from the owner 
as part of an assessment of the refund application. The approval of a refund application may be 
delayed if, without this additional information, the Department is unable to satisfy itself that the 
refund application meets the relevant requirements. 

At the same time, the Department may also request information about lines on an import 
declaration that are not part of the refund application. For example, without limiting the 
circumstances where the Department may request information, there may be circumstances 
where there are connections between lines on an import declaration, or changes to an import 
declaration that are so extensive that it is unclear what has been changed. In these 
circumstances, the Department may need to check and verify other lines on an import declaration 
to satisfy itself that a refund application meets the relevant requirements. 

Approval and payment of the refund will not be withheld due to delays in receiving information 
about matters unrelated to the refund application. 

In circumstances where the person who lodges the refund application does not possess 
documents relating to the original import declaration, the person lodging the refund application 
should facilitate communication with the owner regarding any request for this information. 

If information or documents unrelated to the refund application are requested, and not provided, 
consideration may be given to: 

• 

issuing a notice to produce commercial documents under section 240AA of 
the Customs Act 1901 (the Act); and/or 
issuing a notice to verify records under section 240AC of the Ad; and/or 

• 
•  exercising monitoring powers under sections 214AA-214B of the Act. 

1  Noticesissued under sections 240AA and 240AC may be issued in relation to a customs 
broker who makes a refund application, a broker who submitted the original import declaration, 
and/or the importer of the subject goods.

No.2016/25 

Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods  
on 1 August 2016 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, 
beers and fuel products, operative from 1 August 2016.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor.  This indexation factor 
is calculated by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest 
June or December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. 

On 27 July 2016, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June 2016 Quarter figure (108.6). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for August 2016 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

June Quarter 2016 
108.6 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 
December Quarter 2015 
108.4 

Indexation  
factor 

1.002 

As the indexation factor for August 2016 (1.002) is greater than one, certain rates of customs duty for 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff, will be increased by the application of 
this factor.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 1 August 2016, are set out in 
Table 1 and supersede the rates outlined in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection 
Notice 2016/02. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:  

  Schedule 5 (US originating goods)  
  Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods)  
  Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods)  
  Schedule 8 (ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand originating goods)  
  Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods)  
  Schedule 10 (Korean originating goods)  
  Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods) and  
  Schedule 12 (Chinese originating goods) in the Customs Tariff. 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) will arrange for the publication 
of a Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty Notice for excise-equivalent goods (No.3) 2016 in the 
Gazette.

DEPARTMENT OF  IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 


No. 2016/26 


Importation of lever action shotguns with a magazine capacity of more than 
five rounds 

The Australian  Government has extended the ban  on the  importation of lever action shotguns with  a 
magazine capacity of more than five  rounds  and magazines with  a capacity of more than five  rounds 
for use with  lever action  shotguns. 

The extension of this  ban  is enabled  by the  Customs (Proh ibited  Imports) Amendment (Shotguns and 

Shotgun Magazines) Regulation 2016, which  amends the  Customs (Prohibited  Imports) 

Regulations 1956. The ban  commences on  7 August 2016 . 


The ban on the  importation of these firearms and  magazines is  intended to  be  in  place  until the  review 

of the  National  Firearms Agreement (NFA) is concluded and the agreed  outcomes are  implemented. 


Background 

The ban on  the  importation of lever action shotguns with  a magazine capacity of more than five 
rounds , and  magazines with  a capacity of more than five  rounds for use with  lever action shotguns 
was introduced on  7 August 2015. 

The ban was introduced  so  that the  classification  of these firearms could  be  considered  as  part of the 
review of the  NFA.  The ban  was due to  expire on  7 August 2016,  one  year after its  introduction , as 
the review of the  NFA was intended to  have  been  completed  by that date. 

The review of the  NFA has not been finalised , therefore the Government has extended the ban .

No.2016/27 

Biannual indexation of certain customs duty rates for tobacco  
and tobacco products – 1 September 2016 

This notice sets out the new rates for certain customs duties and excise duties for tobacco and tobacco 
products, operative from 1 September 2016.   

Section 19AB of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), provides for certain customs duty rates 
for tobacco and tobacco products to be indexed biannually, in March and September, to the average 
weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE).  From 1 September 2016, the new rates are determined by 
the application of the AWOTE indexation factor and an “additional factor”.   

The AWOTE indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most recent AWOTE by the highest 
AWOTE for a previous June or December quarter that does not precede the 2012 December quarter. 

On 6 November 2013, the Government announced a series of four 12.5 per cent increases to excise and 
excise-equivalent customs duty for tobacco and tobacco products.  This increase is referred to as the 
“additional factor” in section 19AB of the Customs Tariff. The additional factor for 1 September 2016 
is 1.125. The excise-equivalent customs duty rates are first indexed by the AWOTE indexation factor 
and then by the additional factor.  

On 18 August 2016, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the AWOTE for the June Quarter 2016 
(1516.00). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for September 2016 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent AWOTE  

June Quarter 2016 
1516.00 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter AWOTE 
December Quarter 2015 
1500.00 

Indexation  
factor (AWOTE) 

Additional  
factor 

1.010 

1.125 

As the AWOTE indexation factor for August 2016 (1.010) is greater than one, customs duty rates for 
tobacco and tobacco products, in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff, will be increased by the application 
of the indexation factor and additional factor.   

The customs duty rates for tobacco and tobacco products, operative from 1 September 2016, are set out 
in Table 1 and supersede the rates outlined in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection 
Notice 2016/05.

No.2016/28 

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme - Allocations for 2016-2017 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has determined the 2016-17 allocations under the Cheese and 
Curd Quota Scheme, which it administers on behalf of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. The 
allocation was gazetted on 06 July 2016 in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette - Tariff Concessions No. 2016/25. 

The calculation of an importer's quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 23-month period 
ending 31 May 2016, as shown in departmental records of clearances for home consumption. This calculation 
excludes any part of the quota that was transferred to another importer during the 23-month period or that was unused 
as at 31 May 2016. 

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year. To use the quota allocated, importers are 
required to 'enter for home consumption' their imported cheese or curd by the end of the financial year to which the 
allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year. Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin 
(returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, 
preference circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), quota is unable to be used. Because of the 
commencement of the Chinese FTA, Chinese cheeses are no longer eligible for Cheese and Curd Quota. 

The cheese or curd is considered to be 'entered for home consumption' if: 

(a) 
Protection, and 
(b) 

an entry for home consumption, which identifies item 55, for the goods is lodged with Immigration and Border 

the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port or airport for the 
discharge of cargo. 

Quota allocations are transferable between importers. A person may apply to transfer quota entitlements by 
completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) available at http://www.border.qov.au

No. 2016/30 

Assurances that imported goods do not contain asbestos   

The purpose of this notice is to clarify the assurances that importers need to provide and 
demonstrate to the Australian Border Force (ABF) that goods imported into Australia do not contain 
asbestos. This notice also provides clarification for licensed customs brokers (LCBs) in declaring 
these assurances on behalf of their clients. 

Background 

Since 31 December 2003, an Australia wide ban on the importation, manufacture and use of 
asbestos and products containing asbestos has been in place. In Australia, a product containing 
asbestos is prohibited for importation without prior permission under Regulation 4C of the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956.   

Under sections 233(1) and (1AA) of the Customs Act 1901 it is an offence to import a prohibited 
good. Prohibited imports that arrive at the Australian border may be seized and the importer may be 
prosecuted or subject to penalties.  

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) proactively manages the 
risk of asbestos-containing products from entering into Australia. Since its establishment, the ABF 
has significantly increased its operational and strategic focus on imported goods that pose a risk of 
containing asbestos. The ABF employs a risk based intelligence-led approach to target these high-
risk goods.  

Importers 

It is the responsibility of importers to ensure that they do not import prohibited goods, including 
asbestos. Traders need to be aware of the varying definitions and standards applied to goods in the 
country of origin and / or supply, as some countries allow goods to contain low levels of asbestos.  

Before goods are imported to Australia, importers should ensure their supply chain security by 
confirming with their overseas suppliers that asbestos was not used to manufacture the goods. 
Importers are encouraged to investigate, and where appropriate implement: 

  contractual obligations with their suppliers that specify nil asbestos content; 
  sampling and testing for asbestos content prior to shipping the goods to Australia; and 
 

regular risk assessment and quality assurance processes. 

Importers must provide sufficient assurance to demonstrate that imported goods do not contain 
asbestos. One of the ways importers can provide assurance is through sampling and testing of 
goods by an accredited laboratory. Certification of samples tested outside Australia must be from a 
laboratory that is accredited by international accreditation authorities (that are National Association 
of Testing Authorities (NATA)-recognised equivalents). Any other certificates or statements provided 
by manufacturers or third parties will not be accepted by the ABF.

This notice advises of the amendment to section 19AB of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff) that adds 
a series of four annual 12.5 per cent increases to excise-equivalent customs duty for tobacco and tobacco products 
commencing 1 September 2017, and annually on 1 September 2018, 1 September 2019 and 1 September 2020. 
These increases will coincide with the indexation adjustments for tobacco and tobacco products scheduled for 
these dates. 

The indexation increases in excise-equivalent customs duty for tobacco and tobacco products referenced above 
also applies to goods in:  

  Schedule 5 (US originating goods) 

  Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods) 

  Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods)  

  Schedule 10 (Korean originating goods) 

  Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods)

DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 

No.2016/33 

DECLARING OVERSEAS FREIGHT AND INSURANCE FOR CUSTOMS VALUATION AND 
VALUE OF THE TAXABLE IMPORTATION PURPOSES 

Purpose 

1. To provide advice for importers about the calculation of overseas freight and insurance for 
customs valuation purposes when the amounts for overseas freight and insurance are 
unknown at the time of importation. 

2 To explain the impact of an additional option when determining the value of the taxable 
importation (VoTI), allowed by the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2016 
Measures No.1) Act 2016 (the amending Act), which received Royal Assent on 5 May 2016. 

This Notice supersedes Australian Customs Notices (ACNs) 2005/23 and 1990/71 and any 
previous notices on overseas freight and insurance for the purposes of calculating customs value. 

Calculating Customs Value 

Customs value is used as the basis for calculating customs duty. The relevant customs valuation 
legislation is contained in Division 2 of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act). 

The amending Act does not affect the way customs value is calculated or the information, 
including the overseas transport and insurance amounts, that the Department requires for 
determining customs value in accordance with the Customs Act. This is of particular significance 
for Cost Insurance Freight (CIF), Cost and Freight (CFR) and similar contracts, where the 
overseas freight and insurance amounts are included in the contract price. 

For Free on Board (FOB) contracts, the invoice amount does not include the cost of overseas 
freight and overseas insurance.' Subject to any additions or deductions in accordance with the 
Customs Act, the FOB amount as shown on the invoice will, in most circumstances, be the 
customs value. 

What if the importer does not know the overseas freight and insurance amount for customs 
valuation purposes?  

The calculation of customs value requires the use of actual figures paid or payable for 
overseas freight and insurance. However, the Department recognises that in some 
circumstances, the amount paid or payable for overseas freight and insurance: 

•  will not be known at the time the import declaration is prepared; or 

•  may never be known. 

If owners wish to obtain customs clearance before accurate information about the transport 
or insurance costs is available or in situations where it may never be known, they may 
choose to use an estimate. 

International trading terms, including FOB, CIF and CFR are defined in 'Incoterms® 2010', published by the 

International Chamber of Commerce. More information about Australia's position in relation to these terms of trade is 
available in the Department's Instructions and Guidelines — Customs Valuation, on the Department's website.

No.2016/34 

2017 Harmonized System Changes 

On 13 October 2016, the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon Alex 
Hawke MP, introduced the Customs Tariff Amendment (2017 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2016 
into Parliament. The Bill contains approximately 950 amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the 
Customs Tariff Act) to implement the changes resulting from the World Customs Organization’s fifth 
review of the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, 
commonly referred to as the Harmonized System. Australia is required to implement the changes 
resulting from the fifth review on 1 January 2017. 

The Harmonized System is a hierarchical system that uniquely identifies all traded goods and 
commodities. Since 1988, the Harmonized System has formed the basis of Australia’s commodity 
classifications for traded goods, both imports and exports. Australia has implemented the Harmonized 
System domestically through the Customs Tariff Act for imports and the Australian Harmonized Export 
Commodity Classification (AHECC) for exports. 

The Bill preserves existing levels of industry protection and margins of tariff preference that apply to 
imported goods, including goods imported under Australia’s free trade and economic partnership 
agreements in all but one instance. The classification for electronic integrated circuits is being expanded 
under the 2017 Harmonised System to include multi-component integrated circuits (MCOs). This means 
that a subset of MCOs imported into Australia would have their customs duty rates reduced to ‘Free’. 
Reducing the rate of customs duty to ‘Free’ for all MCOs is, however, consistent with the Expanded 
Information Technology Agreement, to which Australia is a signatory. 

The 2017 Harmonized System revisions affect 41 of the 97 chapters in the Schedule 3 of the Customs 
Tariff Act, through either note changes and/or classification changes. There are extensive revisions to 
Chapter 3, Chapter 29, Chapter 38, Chapter 44, Chapters 84 - 87, and Chapter 96. 

The Customs Amendment (2017 Harmonized System changes) Bill 2016 was also introduced into 
Parliament on 13 October 2016. It makes complementary amendments to the Customs Act 1901.  

Changes to Australia’s tariff classification will not come into effect until 1 January 2017 subject to 
the Bills becoming Acts of Parliament. 

Explanatory documents  

A concordance of tariff items affected by the proposed changes to the Customs Tariff Act is 
at Attachment A. This concordance table will also be published on the 2017 Harmonized System 
changes information webpage on the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the 
Department) website.

No. 2016/35 
_________________________________________________________________________ 

Voluntary disclosures under Section 243T and Section 243U Customs Act 1901 

What is a Voluntary Disclosure? 

A voluntary disclosure is the communication to the Department of Immigration and Border 
Protection (the Department) through a written notice of an error (error notice), omission or 
adjustment in a statement (excluding outturn or cargo reports). 

Examples of an identified error or omission include: 

 

 an error or omission in the customs value, including: 

o 

o 

failure to include a price related cost when calculating the customs value of 
goods  
incorrect adjustments to the customs value relating to transfer pricing 

  an incorrect tariff classification 
  an incorrectly applied Tariff Concession Order.  

Eligibility for protection from penalties and prosecution  

A voluntary disclosure must disclose fully, truthfully and of your own accord, the details of the 
relevant import or export declaration(s) and the nature of the error(s). If the disclosure results 
in additional duty and taxes, the outstanding amount must be paid. If you make a voluntary 
disclosure, you are protected from offences in sections 243T and 243U of 
the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) that relate to false or misleading statements.  

An error notice is not taken to be given voluntarily if: 

  given after an officer exercises a power under a customs-related law to verify the 

information in the statement (such as a 214AD notice); or  

  an infringement notice for an offence against sections 243T or 243U is issued in 

relation to the statement; or  

  proceedings have commenced against an offence within sections 243T or 243U in 

relation to the statement. 

Submitting a Voluntary Disclosure 

An error notice can be made by amending a declaration in the Integrated Cargo System 
(ICS) or through a written declaration to an Australian Border Force (ABF) Officer outlining 
the nature of the errors and the relevant declarations.

No.2016/36 

Introduction of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Expanded Information 
Technology Agreement Implementation and Other Measures) Bill 2016 

On 20 October 2016, the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection introduced 
the Customs Tariff Amendment (Expanded Information Technology Agreement 
Implementation and Other Measures) Bill 2016 (the Bill) into the House of Representatives. 
Subject to the Bill becoming an act of Parliament it will amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 
(the Customs Tariff Act) to incrementally reduce customs duty rates to ‘Free’ on a range of 
information technology products. 

The Bill gives effect to Australia’s obligations under the World Trade Organization’s 
Expanded Information Technology Agreement (the Expanded ITA) and the 2016-17 Budget 
Measure ‘World Trade Organization – Information Technology Agreement’.  The Australian 
Government consulted domestic manufacturers and importers during the Expanded ITA 
negotiation process in 2012-15. 

Further information including the text of the Bill, explanatory memorandum and second 
reading speech can be found on the Parliament House 
website: http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Resu
lts/Result?bId=r5749 

The Bill contains two schedules. The amendments to give effect to the Expanded Information 
Technology Agreement are in Schedule 1. Schedule 2 contains other minor technical 
amendments that serve to reduce the size to the Customs Tariff by removing a large number 
of obsolete customs duty rates.  

Timing of reductions 
The first incremental customs duty rate reductions will occur on 1 January 2017. Annual 
reductions will then commence from 1 July 2017 until 1 July 2021.  

Staging categories 
The size and timing of the reduction to customs duty rates is determined by the staging 
category assigned to each affected tariff subheading. There are seven staging under the 
Expanded ITA outlined in Table 1. The staging category assigned to an individual tariff 
subheading is determined by the commitments made under the Expanded ITA. 

The details of the staging categories, including the tariff subheadings assigned to each staging 
category can be found at Attachment A. 

Concordance 
New tariff classifications have been created to separately identify specific information 
technology products. This will result in a transfer of goods between tariff subheadings. A 
concordance of the amendments proposed by the Bill is at Attachment B. This information is

No. 2016/38 

Replacement of Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940 

Due to the sunsetting of the Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940 (CI Regulations), the Australian 
Government has developed a new regulation called the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Regulation 
2016 (the CTD Regulation) which will commence on 1 April 2017. The CI Regulations will continue 
to be in force until this date. 

The CTD Regulation retains most of the existing trade description requirements that currently apply 
to specified goods, and related matters. The CTD Regulation contains modifications to simplify 
expressions, and to remove redundant provisions. Some goods will no longer require a trade 
description (such as medicines and medicinal preparations) while others are no longer exempt from 
requiring a trade description (such as packages containing less than 15 grams of tobacco).  

In addition, the CTD Regulation aligns with the Australian Government’s broader country of origin 
labelling for food reforms and includes reference to the Country of Origin Labelling Information 
Standard 2016. The mandatory changes to food labelling will not take effect until 1 July 2018.  

Background 

The CTD Regulation was developed to ensure that the Australian Border Force (ABF) can continue 
to enforce labelling requirements for the importation of a range of goods, including food, at the 
Australian border. The Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 and the CTD Regulation give 
officers in the ABF the power to inspect and examine imported goods to determine whether accurate 
trade descriptions, including the country of origin, have been applied. 

In late 2015, prior to the development of the CTD Regulation, the Department of Immigration and 
Border Protection (the Department) undertook a review of the CI Regulations that involved a public 
consultation process. All submissions made during this process were considered by the Department 
when making the CTD Regulation. The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science also 
undertook a separate consultation process in relation to country of origin labelling for food which 
informed the development of the CTD Regulation.  

Further information  

Further information about the CTD Regulation will be made available on the Department’s website at 
www.border.gov.au/Busi/cargo-support-trade-and-goods/importing-goods/labelling-requirements. 
The CTD Regulation is available on the Federal Register of Legislation at

No.2016/39 

Customs Tariff Changes for 1 January 2017 

Department of Immigration and Border Protection Notice No. 2016/34 provided advice on 
amendments contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment (2017 Harmonized System 
Changes) Act 2016 (HS 2017). The changes in this amending Act will take effect on 
1 January 2017. 

This Notice provides further advice on changes to Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs), Tariff 
Precedents and Tariff Advices (TAs) resulting from HS 2017 changes.  

Tariff Concession Orders 

The Department has completed a review of TCOs affected by the HS 2017 changes.   

Attachment A provides a concordance of TCOs to be revoked and replaced with one or more 
new TCOs under the appropriate HS 2017 tariff classifications, with effect from  
1 January 2017. A special Tariff Concessions Gazette will also be issued on 10 January 2017 
to advise of the revocation of the HS 2017 affected TCOs.  Further, it will also advise on the 
consequent replacement TCOs. 

Tariff Precedents  

The Department has reviewed existing Tariff Precedents and identified ten precedents affected 
by HS 2017.  After 1 January 2017, these precedents will be voided or altered and further 
advice will be provided at that time.  

Tariff Advices  

In the course of December 2016, the Department will void approximately 400 Tariff Advices 
affected by the HS 2017 changes.   

A list of the tariff classifications for which TAs will be voided is at Attachment B. The 
Department has notified individual importers by mail regarding TAs to be voided.  Importers 
who wish to seek a new TA to replace a voided one will need to submit a new TA application 
through the Department’s TAPIN system on or after 1 January 2017. 

TAPIN will reject TA applications submitted before 1 January 2017, which refer to new tariff 
classifications operative from that date.  Importers should consult the new Tariff Precedents 
before applying for new TAs.  A list of the tariff classifications for which TAs will be voided 
is at Attachment B.

No.2016/40 

HS 2017 Product Specific Rules of Origin for Free Trade Agreements 

On 1 January 2017, some classifications in the Customs Tariff Act 1995 will change as a 
result of amendments to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System 
(HS2017).  

Detailed information regarding the changes is available in the Department of Immigration 
and Border Protection Notice 2016/34, which is available at 
www.border.gov.au/Customsnotices/Documents/HS-2016-34.pdf. DIBPN 2016/34 provides 
a concordance table of tariff items affected by the proposed changes.  

Free Trade Agreements 

Implementation of the HS2017 changes requires amendments to the rules of origin in the 
following free trade agreements (FTAs): 

  AANZFTA – ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement 
  ANZCERTA – Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement 
  AUSFTA – Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement 
  ChAFTA – China-Australia Free Trade Agreement 
  Chile – Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement 
  JAEPA – Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement 
  KAFTA – Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement 
  MAFTA – Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement 
  SAFTA – Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement 
  TAFTA – Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement 

Australia has commenced negotiations with FTA partners to finalise and implement the 
transposition to HS2017 of the product-specific rules of origin (PSR) for the above FTAs. 

When regulatory requirements to implement HS2017 changes have been completed in 
respect of the PSR schedules for each of Australia’s FTAs, further DIBP Notices will be 
published to notify of the commencement of the new regulatory provisions for each of the 
FTAs. 

Until such notices are issued, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the 
Department) will continue to accept valid Certificates of Origin (COO) and self-certification of 
origin (also known as ‘declarations of origin’) with HS2012 classifications for goods imported 
into Australia. 

In cases where the COO or the self-certification has been issued with HS2012 
classifications, the importer will need to ensure that the goods are classified using HS2017 
on their import declaration.

No.2016/43 

Implementation of the Expanded Information Technology Agreement 
and other 1 January 2017 changes 

Department of Immigration and Border Protection Notice No. 2016/36 provided advice on the 
amendments contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment (Expanded Information Technology 
Agreement Implementation and Other Measures) Bill 2016. These amendments will take effect on 
1 January 2017. 

This Notice provides further information on the consequential changes to Tariff Concession Orders 
(TCOs), Tariff Precedents, Tariff Advices, and statistical code changes.  

Tariff Concession Orders 

The Department has identified 629 TCOs which will be affected by the implementation of the 
Expanded Information Technology Agreement (EITA).  

Attachment A provides details of TCO concordance for the EITA amendments to the            
Customs Tariff Act 1995.  The attachment lists existing TCOs affected by the changes, the new 
classifications of those TCOs and the new TCO numbers to be used from 1 January 2017.  The 
table also provides details of TCOs that are proposed to be revoked outright as a result of the TCO 
wording being incompatible with the new classification, or due to their non-use for a period of two 
years. 

There will be three special Tariff Concession Gazettes for changes to TCOs, as a result of the 
changes in tariff classifications caused by the EITA amendments.   These Gazettes will be 
published on 12, 13, and 16 January 2017. 

Tariff Precedents 

Six Tariff Precedents affected by the EITA amendments will be altered to reflect classification 
changes and re-issued in early January 2017. These will be made available on the Department’s 
Tariff Public Advice Products page at http://www.border.gov.au/Busi/cargo-support-trade-and-
goods/importing-goods/tariff-classification-of-goods/tariff-public-advice-products for industry 
feedback prior to finalisation. 

Tariff Advices 

The Department will void 288 Tariff Advices affected by the implementation of the 
EITA. Attachment B sets out tariff classifications for those Tariff Advices that will become void at 
23:59 on 31 December 2016.

No.2017/02 

Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods  
on 1 February 2017 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, 
beers and fuel products, operative from 1 February 2017.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor.  This indexation factor 
is calculated by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest 
June or December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. 

On 25 January 2017, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December 2016 Quarter figure 
(110.0). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for February 2017 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

December Quarter 2016 
110.0 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 
June Quarter 2016 
108.6 

Indexation  
factor 

1.013 

As the indexation factor for February 2017 (1.013) is greater than one, certain rates of customs duty for 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff, will be increased by the application of 
this factor.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 1 February 2017, are set out in 
Table 1 and supersede the rates outlined in Department of Immigration and Border Protection Notice 
2016/25. 

As a result of the 2017 Harmonized System changes, subheadings 2204.22.30 and 2204.22.90 were 
created and subheadings 3824.90.50 and 3824.90.60 were repealed and replaced with 3824.99.30 and 
3824.99.40 respectively. These amendments are reflected in Table 1.

No.2017/05 

Biannual indexation of customs duty rates for certain tobacco and  
tobacco products – 1 March 2017  

The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) 
amount for the December Quarter 2016 on 23 February 2017.  In accordance with the indexation 
provisions in section 19AB of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff Act), the customs duty rates on 
certain tobacco and tobacco products, in Schedule 3 of the Tariff Act, will increase on 1 March 2017.  
This Notice sets out the new customs duty rates for excise-equivalent goods (Table 1) and excise duty 
rates (Table 2). 

The new customs duty rates for excise-equivalent goods and excise duty rates are calculated by 
multiplying the previous rates by an indexation factor.  The indexation factor is calculated by dividing 
the most recent AWOTE amount, i.e. the December Quarter 2016 amount, by the previous highest June 
or December Quarter that does not precede the December Quarter 2012.  

Accordingly, the December Quarter 2016 amount (1533.40) has been divided by the June Quarter 2016 
amount (1516.00) to establish an indexation factor of 1.011. As this factor is greater than one, rates of 
excise-equivalent customs duty and excise duty are increased by the application of this indexation 
factor.  

Tobacco duty rate on the day 
before the indexation day 

×     1.011    

The formula above is also used to calculate the indexation rate for specific tobacco products subject to 
indexation in:  

•  Schedule 5 (US originating goods)  
•  Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods)  
•  Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods)  
•  Schedule 8 (ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand originating goods)  
•  Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods)  
•  Schedule 10 (Korean originating goods)  
•  Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods) and  
•  Schedule 12 (Chinese originating goods) in the Customs Tariff. 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection will arrange for the publication of a Notice of 
Substituted Rates of Customs Duty for Excise-Equivalent Goods Notice (No. 2) 2017 in the 
Commonwealth Gazette on 1 March 2017.

No. 2017/06 

Commencement of Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Regulation 2016 

On 1 April 2017, the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Regulation 2016 (the CTD Regulation) will 
commence and replace the sunsetting Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940 (the CI Regulations). 

The CTD Regulation retains most of the existing trade description requirements in the  
CI Regulations that apply to specified goods. The CTD Regulation contains modifications to simplify 
expressions, and to remove redundant provisions. Some goods will no longer require a trade 
description (such as medicines and medicinal preparations) while others are no longer exempt from 
requiring a trade description (such as packages containing less than 15 grams of tobacco).  

The CTD Regulation aligns with the Australian Government’s country of origin labelling for food 
reforms. Mandatory changes to food labelling will take effect from 1 July 2018. 

Background 

The Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 (the CTD Act) and, from 1 April 2017, the CTD 
Regulation together set out which goods or classes of goods require labelling, what labelling is 
required and where the label must be applied, before goods can be imported into Australia. 

The CTD Regulation was developed to ensure that the Australian Border Force (ABF) can continue 
to enforce labelling requirements for the importation of certain of goods, including food, at the 
Australian border. The CTD Act and the CTD Regulation give ABF officers the power to inspect and 
examine imported goods to determine whether accurate trade descriptions, including the country of 
origin, have been applied. 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection issued a notice on 20 December 2016 
notifying stakeholders that the CI Regulations are being replaced (DIBP Notice No. 2016/38). 

Further information  

Further information about and a link to the CTD Regulation is available on the Department’s website 
at www.border.gov.au/Busi/cargo-support-trade-and-goods/importing-goods/labelling-requirements.

No.2017/08 

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 2017-2018 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) will shortly contact Cheese and Curd Quota 
Scheme holders to discuss quota allocations for 2017-2018. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 
23-month period ending 31 May 2017, as shown in the Department’s records of Import Declarations lodged between 
01 July 2015 and 31 May 2017. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, importers 
are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the financial year to which 
the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin 
(returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, then 
the quota cannot be used.  Similarly, if preference circumstances or Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) apply, then the 
quota is not available.  

The cheese or curd is ‘entered for home consumption’ if: 

(a) 
(b) 

an entry for home consumption for the goods is lodged with the Department; and   
the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port or airport at which any 
cargo is intended to be discharged. 

Please note that: 

 

 

The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer during the 23-month 
period or that remains unused at 31 May 2017. 

Quota used during the month of June 2016 will be taken into consideration for allocation 2017-2018, but will 
NOT count in computations for 2018-2019.  This June ‘factor’ is repetitive for every annual allocation because 
of the 31 May import performance cut-off for calculation of following year’s allocations. 

At this time of the year, quota users and their brokers should take stock of quota balances with a view to optimising 
usage and consequently maximising their next allocation. 

We will publish the final allocation in the Commonwealth of Australia: Tariff Concessions Gazette in July 2017. 

Where you anticipate quota usage shortfalls, there is an option to transfer allocations between importers.  You can 
apply for a transfer by completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) and submitting it to: 

Superintendent – Tariff Concession Administration 
Australian Border Force 
Department of Immigration and Border Protection 
PO Box 25 
BELCONNEN   ACT   2617 

Alternatively, this form may be submitted by email to Tariff Concession Administration at tarcon@border.gov.au. 

Transfer requests are processed in order of their receipt.  Each request may take up to four working days to process.  
The transfer form is available on the Department’s website at 
https://www.border.gov.au/Forms/Documents/b235.pdf#search=B235.

No.2017/11

Reporting of warehoused petroleum importations to the Department of

Immigration and Border Protection


The purpose of this notice is to remind industry of their reporting obligations to the Department of
Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) when importing some petroleum products.

Certain petroleum products produced or manufactured in Australia are liable for excise duty. Apart from
biodiesel and denatured ethanol, an equivalent rate of import duty is imposed on like importations,
termed excise equivalent goods or EEGs. The duty is imposed to ensure consistency in treatment for
both imported and domestic goods in the Australian market.

General Reporting Obligations for EEGs under Customs Control that Undergo Manufacture

Part VAA of the Customs Act 1901 provides that EEGs entered for warehousing on a warehouse
declaration (Nature 20) may lawfully undergo manufacture while they are under customs control and
duty unpaid. Under this provision, further manufacture can only occur at a premises appropriately
licensed both for excise manufacture under the Excise Act 1901 and as a warehouse under the Customs
Act 1901. When that manufacture takes place, the import duty equivalent to the excise duty is
extinguished, provided the product is not biodiesel or denatured ethanol. The resulting manufactured
product, if excisable, becomes subject to excise duty. Excise duty is collected by the Australian Taxation
Office (ATO).

An acquitting return in the form of a Nature 30 ex-warehouse Import Declaration that cites Treatment
Code 444 (termed a 444 Nature 30 Import Declaration) is required for the EEG used in this manufacture.
This pays any ad valorem import duty and GST liability to the Department. The 444 Nature 30 Import
Declaration must be lodged within 8 days after the end of the manufacture period; a manufacture period
being a 7 day period beginning on a Monday unless the regulations prescribe otherwise.

Accuracy of Declarations involving Liquid Petroleum made to the Department

The quantity of petroleum or petroleum like product loaded onto the importing vessel and initially
declared to the Department is normally different to the quantity discharged. Importers need to ensure the
quantities actually discharged are correctly measured and reported on any declaration made to the
Department by amending declarations accordingly. This includes statements made on Sea Cargo
Reports, Sea Cargo Outturn Reports and Nature 10, Nature 20 and Nature 30 Declarations.

Nature 30 Import Declarations that subsequently report the quantities that went into home consumption
or, if they are 444 Nature 30 Import Declarations, underwent excise manufacture, must also declare
those quantities correctly. The quantities declared on a Nature 20 must equal those declared on the
acquitting Nature 30 Import Declarations unless some or all of those imports are still being kept in the
licensed premises, have been exported or are otherwise accounted for.

N0. 2017/14 

Important reminder about supply chain legislative requirements 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) and the Department’s operational 
arm,  the  Australian  Border  Force  (ABF),  have  a  mission  to  protect  Australia’s  border  and  manage  the 
movement of people and goods across it.  

This mission  is underpinned by  legislation,  including the Customs Act 1901 (the Act)  and the Customs 
Regulation 2015 (the Regulation). Organisations involved in supply chain services must ensure that their 
activities are compliant with the provisions of these and other border related laws. 

In accordance with section 30 of the Act, all goods shall be subject to customs control from the time of their 
importation until they are either delivered into home consumption in accordance with an authority to deal 
(ATD), or they are exported to a place outside Australia.  

It is an offence under section 33 of the Act for a person to move, alter or interfere with goods subject to 
customs control without authorisation. The Department has developed a number of webpages to assist 
organisations in complying with reporting obligations as outlined in the Act. 

Depots 

Depots are licensed to operate by the Department under section 77G of the Act (s77G depot)  and 
undertake activities such as receiving, deconsolidating, packing, delivering and short term storing of 
import and export cargo. Their principal role is to report details of any cargo subject to customs control 
received into, unpacked at, and leaving their establishment. It is important that depot licence holders 
familiarise themselves with their obligations and the processes used to communicate with the 
Department and receive information about cargo subject to customs control.  

Outturn Reporting 

Outturn reports are used to report to the Department any variations between the reported cargo and the 
cargo that was actually unloaded from the ship or aircraft, including surplus or shortlanded cargo.   

For more information, please refer to the Depot outturn reporting obligations factsheet. 

Underbond Movements 

An authorised underbond movement allows the movement of goods subject to customs control between 
licensed establishments (other than for warehousing).  

For more information, please refer to the Correct use of underbond movements factsheet. 

Time up Goods 

Cargo received at a s77G depot can only be stored in that depot until the end of the following month. 
After this time has lapsed, the cargo is referred to as ‘time up goods’.  

For more information, please refer to the Time up goods factsheet.

No.2017/16 

Definition of “Owner” and the compliance approach for the purposes of 
revenue recovery and duty demands 

Purpose 

The purpose of this Notice is to provide general advice to industry and owners/importers on the definition of 
“Owner” contained in the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act). In addition, this Notice outlines the broad compliance 
approach for the purposes of duty demands and revenue recovery under section 165 of the Customs Act.  

This Notice should be read in conjunction with the Australian Customs and Border Protection Notice 2014/50 that 
relates specifically to the application of the definition of “Owner” to importations where the imported goods are sold 
under the ‘Delivered Duty Paid’ Incoterm® as set out in the International Chamber of Commerce Incoterm® Rules. 

Who is an ""Owner” under the Customs Act?  

Section 4 of the Customs Act defines “Owner” as follows: 

""Owner "" in respect of goods includes any person (other than an officer of Customs) being or holding himself or 
herself out to be the owner, importer, exporter, consignee, agent, or person possessed of, or beneficially interested 
in, or having any control of, or power of disposition over the goods.  

This means that most parties participating in an import or export supply chain, including licensed customs brokers, 
may be considered the “Owner” for the purposes of the Customs Act. 

Why is the definition so broad? 

Commercial arrangements covering the sale and importation of goods are many and varied. The contract of sale 
will generally set out the responsibilities of each party to the commercial transaction and usually identifies the 
person with the responsibility, under the contract, for paying the relevant duties and taxes. This is done through the 
use of the relevant Incoterm® as set out in the International Chamber of Commerce Incoterm® Rules.  

Under the Customs Act however, the responsibility to comply with important provisions including in relation to the 
making of an import declaration and payment of duty, rests with the “Owner” as defined in section 4. This operates 
to make the liability effectively joint and several.  For example, one of the persons mentioned in the definition has to 
comply with the requirements to make an import declaration and to pay the correct duty and once that is done, no 
other party is liable to pay the duty. That is the case regardless of the commercial arrangements. 

What happens when the person who has responsibility to pay the duty under the commercial contract 
doesn’t pay? 

Section 11 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014, places an obligation on the 
Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) to pursue a debt owing to the Commonwealth. This can 
include issuing a demand for duty on a party that may not be identified under the commercial contract as the 
person responsible for paying the duty. Examples of where this may happen include where a party cannot pay as 
that party is insolvent, or it is uneconomic to pursue the party for the debt such as may be the case where a party is 
based overseas.

No. 2017/17 

Important reminder about export reporting obligations 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) and the Department’s 
operational arm, the Australian Border Force (ABF), have a mission to protect Australia’s border and 
manage the movement of people and goods across it. 

This mission is underpinned by legislation, including the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) and the Customs 
Regulation 2015 (the Regulation). 

In accordance with section 30 of the Act, export goods are subject to customs control and must be 
reported to the Department using either an export declaration or exemption code.  

It is the responsibility of exporters, and their agents, to understand their obligations and ensure that 
export goods are reported correctly.  

Accurate Export Data 

Accurate export data is important to the Government and the private sector for various reasons, 
including: 

 Use of export entry data by the ABF when risk assessing outbound cargo to ensure that relevant

border controls are maintained and that Government revenue is protected
Australian and overseas investors use export statistics to conduct market research and identify
business opportunities
Export statistics are used to monitor and assess market share and trading patterns





Reporting Exports 

An export declaration is a statement made by the exporter, or their agent, to the Department providing 
information about the goods and the export transaction. Exporters must accurately complete all fields on 
an export declaration.  

Generally, goods intended to be exported from Australia must be declared to the Department on an 
export declaration if they: 

 Require an export permit, regardless of their value
 Have a value greater than AUD 2000, except exempt goods

Export declarations are also required for goods on which a drawback is to be claimed, or customable and 
excisable goods on which duty/excise has not been paid. 

There are certain goods that are excluded from the requirement to report to the Department using an 
export declaration. These exempt goods are instead required to be quoted on export manifests and sub-
manifests using the appropriate exemption code. Exporters must accurately complete all mandatory 
fields in the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) for exempt goods. 

Generally, goods that are exempt from requiring an export declaration include: 

Personal or household effects
Pets



 Certain consignments with a value of less than AUD 2000

Statistical Code, Duty Rate and Other Changes for 1 July 2017 

Statistical code changes 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has advised of a change to a statistical code descriptor in the 
Customs Tariff Working pages, from 1 July 2017, for tariff subheading 9405.10.00 59 with the descriptor

Customs Tariff Amendment Act 2017 

The date of Proclamation for this Act is 1 July 2017. The following amendments commence on this date: 

•

•

Schedule 1 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Tariff Act) is repealed, and simultaneously re-enacted in
the Customs Tariff Regulation 2004.

Section 16A of the Tariff Act is repealed, removing agriculture safeguard provisions relating to the
Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which expired on 31 December 2008.

• Additional Notes to Chapter 7, 8 and 19 of the Tariff Act which clarify the tariff classification of certain
fruits, vegetables and pastas. The text of the new Additional Notes can be found at Attachment B.

• An end date of 31 December 2017 is inserted for the Enhanced Project By-law Scheme, implemented
under Item 44 to Schedule 4 of the Tariff Act. Importers who currently have a valid determination will
continue to be able to access the Scheme until the end date of the determination. This measure was
announced in the 2016-17 Budget.

No.2017/19 

Increase to Commonwealth penalty unit value from $180 to $210 

On 1 July 2017, the value of a Commonwealth penalty unit increased from $180 to $210. Consequently, 
the maximum financial penalties for committing various Commonwealth offences also rose from this date. 
Under most Commonwealth laws, financial penalties are generally expressed in terms of ‘penalty units’ 
instead of dollar figures. As an example, a maximum fine would generally be expressed as ‘10 penalty 
units’ as opposed to a dollar value of $2,100. 

This increase in the value of the penalty unit will ensure that financial penalties remain an effective 
punishment and deterrent to the commission of Commonwealth offences.  To ensure the real value of the 
penalty unit is maintained, the penalty unit will then be automatically increased according to inflation 
every three years, beginning from 1 July 2020. 

The new penalty unit value will only apply to offences that are committed on or after 1 July 2017. This 
means that the changes will not apply to current proceedings or offences that were committed before this 
date. Any fines imposed for offences committed before 1 July 2017 will be based on the value of the 
penalty unit at the time the offence was committed.  

The table below illustrates the change with examples that indicate the maximum penalty a court may 
impose and what will be imposed under the Infringement Notice Scheme (INS) that came into effect on 
1 February 2014.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2017-20.pdf,Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods on 1 August 2017,"DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 

No.2017/20 

Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods  
on 1 August 2017 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, 
beers and fuel products, operative from 1 August 2017.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff), provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor.  This indexation factor 
is calculated by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest 
June or December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. 

On 26 July 2017, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June 2017 Quarter figure (110.7). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for August 2017 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

June Quarter 2017 
110.7 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 
December Quarter 2016 
110.0 

Indexation  
factor 

1.006 

As the indexation factor for August 2017 (1.006) is greater than one, certain rates of customs duty for 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff, will be increased by the application of 
this factor.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 1 August 2017, are set out in 
Table 1 and supersede the rates outlined in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection 
Notice 2017/02. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:  

  Schedule 5 (US originating goods)  
  Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods)  
  Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods)  
  Schedule 8 (ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand originating goods)  
  Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods)  
  Schedule 10 (Korean originating goods)  
  Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods) and  
  Schedule 12 (Chinese originating goods) in the Customs Tariff. 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) will arrange for the publication 
of a Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty for excise-equivalent goods (No.3) 2017 in the 
Gazette.

No. 2017/21 

Assurances that imported goods do not contain asbestos   

This notice outlines the Australian Border Force’s (ABF) requirements for importers and licensed customs 
brokers in relation to Australia’s prohibition on the importation of asbestos and goods containing asbestos.  

This notice repeals and replaces Department of Immigration and Border Protection Notice No.2016/30.  

Background 

An Australia-wide ban on the manufacture and use of all types of asbestos and asbestos containing materials 
took effect on 31 December 2003. It is prohibited to import fibrous forms of asbestos or goods containing 
asbestos into Australia unless a permission or exemption has been granted, or a lawful exception applies 
under Regulation 4C of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. 

The ABF must be satisfied that goods entering Australia do not contain asbestos. Under powers in the 
Customs Act 1901, the ABF can examine goods and seek additional information from importers to determine 
whether the goods are prohibited imports.  

Goods suspected of containing asbestos will be held at the border until either the ABF is assured the 
importation is lawful or the ABF is satisfied of no asbestos content.  Goods found to contain asbestos will be 
seized and the importers may be subject to penalties or prosecution.  

It is the responsibility of importers to take appropriate action to ensure that they do not import goods that 
contain asbestos into Australia, unless an exception, exemption or prior permission from the Minister of 
Employment applies.  

When making an import declaration, importers are required to declare if goods contain, or may contain, 
asbestos. However, the ABF does not solely rely on information included on an import declaration. It risk 
assesses 100 per cent of goods entering Australia and targets those considered at risk of containing asbestos. 
This may include goods that are known to contain asbestos, are supplied from countries with asbestos-
producing industries, and/or are shipped from overseas suppliers previously identified as sending asbestos or 
goods containing asbestos to Australia. This means that importers who have declared “no” to the presence of 
asbestos may be required to provide information to assure the ABF that the goods do not contain asbestos.  

Assurance Requirements  

The ABF will require importers who have declared “yes” to the presence of asbestos to arrange testing and 
certification in Australia, unless a relevant exception, exemption or permission applies.  

Importers need to have sufficient knowledge of their goods back to the point of manufacture. Importers 
declaring “no” to asbestos content in their goods must only do so if they are certain that their goods do not 
contain asbestos by design, or by the use of naturally contaminated ingredients, during manufacture. 
Importers need to obtain sufficient information, prior to shipment, when unsure of any asbestos content, parts 
or components accompanying the primary item of import that are a risk (such as gaskets), or whether 
asbestos was present at any point in the supply chain process.  

If the information presented does not provide sufficient assurance, the ABF will require importers to arrange 
testing and certification in Australia by a laboratory accredited by the National Association of Testing 
Authorities (NATA).

No. 2017/22 

Introduction of a domestic mandatory safety standard: decorative alcohol fuelled 
devices (ethanol burners) 

On 5 July 2017, the Minister for Small Business, the Honourable Michael McCormack, introduced a 
mandatory safety standard under the Australian Consumer Law for ethanol burners supplied in 
Australia. The mandatory safety standard took effect on 15 July 2017. Ethanol burners that do not 
meet safety requirements are not permitted for sale in Australia. 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection does not regulate imported ethanol burners at 
the border or ensure that they conform to the requirements of the mandatory safety standard. Ethanol 
burners are not a prohibited or restricted import. However, importers should be aware of the 
mandatory safety standard that now applies to ethanol burners imported for commercial purposes to 
be sold domestically in Australia. 

Background 

Ethanol-fuelled fireplaces and table-top burners are commonly sold in Australia. Recently, there have 
been a number of serious injuries associated with the use of these devices. 

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), with relevant state and territory 
regulators, are responsible for ensuring consumer goods comply with mandatory safety standards. 
This includes ethanol burners sold in the Australian market. 

Ethanol burners have been associated with more than 100 injuries and at least 36 house fires across 
Australia since 2010. In response to safety concerns, the Minister for Small Business imposed an 
interim ban on ethanol burners that do not meet the mandatory safety standard. This followed advice 
from the ACCC on its findings during its safety investigation into ethanol burners. The interim ban 
expired on 14 July 2017. Suppliers have three months to transition from the interim ban and ensure 
their products meet mandatory safety standards. 

Further information  

Further information about the mandatory safety standard is available on the ACCC’s website at 
https://www.productsafety.gov.au/standards/decorative-alcohol-fuelled-devices.

No.2017/25 

Biannual indexation of certain customs duty rates for tobacco 
and tobacco products – 1 September 2017 

This notice sets out the new rates of excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco products, 
operative from 1 September 2017.  

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco Duty Harmonisation) Act 2017 (the Amendment Act) 
received the Royal Assent on 15 August 2017, and will commence on 31 August 2017. The Amendment 
Act separates the indexation provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate from the 
indexation provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco 
content’ rate. The indexation provisions are outlined below. 

Indexation provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate 

Section 19AC of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides for the excise-equivalent 
customs duty rate applied to tobacco products classified to tariff subheadings where the amount of 
customs duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis to be indexed biannually, in March and September, to 
the average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE). In addition, from 1 September 2016 until 
1 September 2020, an additional indexation factor of 12.5 per cent is applied to the September 
indexation subsequent to AWOTE indexation. 

Indexation provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco 
content’ 

The Amendment Act inserts Section 19ACA. This section applies to tobacco products classified to tariff 
subheadings where the amount of excise-equivalent customs duty is determined on a ‘per kilogram’ or 
‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ basis. This section provides for the excise-equivalent customs duty 
rate applied to these goods to be adjusted biannually in March and September at the same time that the 
‘per stick’ rate is indexed. The new rate will be determined by dividing the ‘per stick’ rate by the weight 
conversion factor that applies for the 12 month period commencing on 1 September of the relevant year. 

Equivalent amendments were made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. 

Calculation of excise-equivalent customs duty rates operative from 1 September 2017 

On 17 August 2017, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the AWOTE figure for the 
June Quarter 2017 (1543.2). The AWOTE indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most recent 
AWOTE figure by the highest AWOTE figure for a previous June or December quarter that does not 
precede the 2012 December Quarter.

No.2017/26 

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme - Allocations for 2017-2018 

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has determined the 2017-18 allocations under the Cheese and 
Curd Quota Scheme, which it administers on behalf of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. The 
allocation was gazetted on 05 July 2017 in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette - Tariff Concessions No. 2017/29. 

The calculation of an importer's quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 23-month period 
ending 31 May 2017, as shown in departmental records of clearances for home consumption. This calculation 
excludes any part of the quota that was transferred to another importer during the 23-month period or that was unused 
as at 31 May 2017. 

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year. To use the quota allocated, importers are 
required to 'enter for home consumption' their imported cheese or curd by the end of the financial year to which the 
allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year. Where cheese or curd importations are of Australian origin 
(returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995; 
preference circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) exist, quota is unable to be used. 

The cheese or curd is considered to be 'entered for home consumption' if: 

(a)

Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposal and Other Measures) 
Act 2017 

This notice sets out the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff Act) made by 
the Customs Tariff Act (Incorporation of Proposal and Other Measures) Act 2017 (the Amendment 
Act). The Amendment Act received the Royal Assent on 16 August 2017. The Amendment Act 
contains five measures, with various commencement dates. 

The Online Tariff will be updated prior to the commencement of the amendments.  

Retrospective Commencement – 1 January 2017 

Incorporation of Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2017 

The Amendment Act incorporates Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2017 to ensure that the correct rate 
of customs duty of ‘Free’ is applied to tariff subheading 6907.30.10. This amendment is retrospective 
and is taken to have commenced on 1 January 2017, the same day that Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 
2017 commenced. 

Extending concessional arrangements for automotive prototypes 

Item 39 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act provides a ‘Free’ rate of duty for eligible vehicles and 
components for use in testing, quality control, manufacturing evaluation or engineering development of 
motor vehicles or components. Currently the concessional rate of customs duty for these goods is only 
available to motor vehicle producers registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme. 

The Amendment Act extends the scope of eligible importers to include automotive service providers 
registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme. The revised text of Item 39 is at 
Attachment A. 

This measure was included in the 2017-18 Budget and is taken to have commenced on 1 January 2017. 
Automotive service providers that imported eligible goods between 1 January 2017 and 
16 August 2017, or before 1 January 2017 but where the date for working out the duty had not occurred 
before 1 January 2017, will be able to apply for a refund through the standard procedures.  

13 September 2017 Commencement 

Machining centre of 8465.20 

The Amendment Act alters the structure of the tariff subheadings under 8465.20 to simplify the 
classification of machining centres capable of performing multiple machining operations with an 
automatic tooling change. The Amendment Act repeals tariff subheadings 8465.20.10 to 8465.20.60, 
inclusive, and replaces them with 8465.20.70 and 8465.20.80. The text of the new tariff subheadings

N0. 2017/28 

Cargo Timeliness Report 

Voluntary compliance with the legislated requirements for cargo reporting remains a key area of focus for 
the Australian Border Force (ABF). Cargo reports lodged in the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) outside of 
the  legislated timeframes limit the ABF’s  ability  to  undertake effective risk assessment and can lead to 
delays in clearance. The ABF continues to work with industry to improve reporting performance and, where 
necessary, apply treatment options for non-compliance. 

As part of this approach, the ABF has developed a new report in the ICS – the cargo timeliness report 
(the report). 

Legislative Requirements 

Mandatory reporting timeframes are specified under section 64AB of the Customs Act 1901 and sections 
15 and 21 of the Customs Regulation 2015 (the Regulation). It is a requirement that: 

-  Under paragraph 64AB (8)(b), air cargo reports must be lodged at least two hours prior to the 

estimated time of arrival of the aircraft specified in the impending arrival report. 

-  Under paragraph 64AB (8)(a)(i), sea cargo reports must be lodged at least 48 hours prior to the 

estimated time of arrival of the ship at the first Australian Port, or for voyages less than 96 hours, as 
specified in the Regulation. 

Cargo Timeliness Report  

The report provides a facility for cargo reporters to monitor their individual reporting performance including 
incidences of late reported cargo. It includes both summary and detailed information for late reported cargo 
reports and an industry average benchmark for comparison. This will enable cargo reporters to compare 
their performance with the industry average. 

This will also assist cargo reporters to improve business practices and to monitor trends relating to their 
lodgement of cargo reports in accordance with legislated timeframes. It can be run for any time period and 
provides filtering options to assist with analysis.  

The report is available, via the reports menu, to any reporter with access to the ICS. Details on how to 
access the new report can be found here. 

Compliance Approach  

The ABF requires accurate and timely cargo reporting to undertake proper risk assessment, and to 
facilitate clearance of cargo. The introduction of the report does not change existing legislated 
requirements for cargo reporting. 

The ABF is committed to working with industry to improve compliance.

No.2017/30 

Notice of Intention to Propose Customs Tariff Alterations (No. 1) 2017 

On 20 September 2017, Notice of Intention to Propose Customs Tariff Alterations (No. 1) 2017 (the 
Notice) was published in the Commonwealth Government Notices Gazette. 

The Notice repeals table items 123 to 125, inclusive, of Schedule 8 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the 
Customs Tariff Act) effective from 20 September 2017. Repealing these table items reduces the 
preferential customs duty rates for eligible goods from five per cent to ‘Free’. These amendments apply 
to goods imported into Australia:  

•
•

on or after 20 September 2017; and
before 20 September 2017, where the time for working out the rate of customs duty had not
occurred before 20 September 2017.

These table items provide preferential rates of duty for goods classified to the following tariff 
subheadings: 

Table Item 
123 
123A 
123B 
123C 
(a) Prescribed goods only. Prescribed goods are provided for in the Customs Tariff Regulations 2004.

Tariff Subheading 
3808.52.90(a) 
3808.59.90(a) 
3808.61.90 
3808.62.90 

Tariff Subheading 
3808.69.90 
3808.91.90 
3808.93.00 

Table Item 
123D 
124 
125 

The removal of these preferential customs duty rates was announced by the Prime Minister and the 
President of the Republic of Indonesia on 26 February 2017. Australia agreed to remove customs duty 
on pesticides and herbicides from Indonesia, and Indonesia agreed to reduce customs duties on 
Australian sugar. These amendments are an early outcome of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive 
Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations. 

To formalise these amendments Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2017 will be tabled in the Parliament 
within the next seven sitting days. Legislation to amend the Customs Tariff Act needs to receive the 
Royal Assent within 12 months. 

The Online Tariff has been amended to reflect these changes.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2017-32.pdf,New consolidated cargo clearance benefit commences,"DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION NOTICE 
No. 2017/32 

New consolidated cargo clearance benefit commences 

From 15 November 2017, a new consolidated cargo clearance benefit for the Australian 
Trusted Trader (ATT) programme commences. Under this benefit Trusted Traders, or their 
licensed Customs brokers, will be permitted to lodge a single import declaration for a 
consolidated consignment across all shipment types for sea and air cargo. 

Carriers and freight forwarders will continue to provide cargo reports, at the supplier level 
(reflecting current practice), but the consolidated shipment will be able to be cleared on a single 
import declaration.  

This will streamline clearance requirements and costs for Trusted Traders. 

Changes to import declaration requirements for Trusted Traders 

For sea cargo, when the importer is identified as a Trusted Trader, multiple suppliers can be 
provided on an import declaration when there is more than one transport line (cargo report), 
as long as the Ocean Bill of Lading is the same, or any of the lines are FCX. 

For air cargo, when the importer is identified as a Trusted Trader, multiple suppliers can be 
provided on an import declaration when there is more than one transport line, as long as the 
Master Air Waybill is the same. 

If any part of the consolidated import declaration matches a risk profile, the entire shipment will 
be ‘held’. Trusted Trader importers will be able to report their cargo on single, or multiple import 
declarations in whichever way best addresses their business process.  

Importers that are not Trusted Traders 

For importers outside of the ATT programme, there will be no change to current import 
clearance requirements. An import declaration lodged by these importers (or their Customs 
brokers) will still be required for each supplier in a consolidated shipment, other than for sea 
cargo type FCX.  

Changes to Integrated Cargo System (ICS) 

To implement the new consolidated cargo clearance benefit, enhancements to the ICS will be 
implemented on 15 November 2017.  

Further information 

For further information on how to access this, and other exciting, trade facilitation benefits 
available under the ATT programme, visit: www.border.gov.au/trustedtrader.

(DIBPN)  

No. 2017/33 

Agreement to Amend the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement 
Entry into Force 1 December 2017 

The Agreement to Amend the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (the Amending 
Agreement) entered into force on 1 December 2017 for Australia and Singapore.  The amended 
Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) is a key economic pillar of the 
Singapore-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership launched in June 2015.  The 
amendments to SAFTA, amongst other matters, will further reduce red tape for exporters and 
promote greater regulatory coherence between Australia and Singapore. 

Key legislative changes were required to give effect to the Amending Agreement’s obligations.  
These were to: 

 

 

 

insert new Division 1BA into Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act) to 
determine eligible Singaporean originating goods in accordance with the new rules of 
origin (new RoO). 

implement related product-specific rules for goods; 

implement self-certification documentation requirements to claim preferential tariff 
treatment for Singaporean originating goods; and 

  provide for Singaporean originating goods (except for those that are excise-equivalent 

goods) to be duty-free. 

To allow importers time to adjust their supply chains and to ensure that no one is disadvantaged, 
both the framework for the new RoO and the original RoO (those in force on 30 November 2017) 
may be separately satisfied in order to claim preferential tariff treatment for a period of three 
years.  Advice on how this transitional arrangement can be accessed is set out in the following 
documents: 

  Those claiming preferential duty for Singaporean originating goods under the new 

RoO should refer to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Rules of Origin 
Procedural Instructions, published in December 2017. 

  Those claiming preferential duty for goods that are ‘the produce or manufacture of 
Singapore’ under the original RoO should refer to Singapore-Australia Free Trade 
Agreement Rules of Origin Instruction and Guidelines July 2009 revised for 
1 December 2017, which includes legislation that was current as at 1 December 2017. 

At the end of the three-year transitional period, on 1 December 2020, the framework for the 
original RoO will be repealed. After this date only the framework relating to the new RoO will 
continue to be used as a basis of a claim for preferential tariff treatment.   

The repeal of the relevant framework does not affect refunds or records keeping obligations that 
apply to the previous framework.  More information about these are below.

2018-12-10,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2017-38.pdf,Renewal of Customs Broker Licenses,"DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND BORDER 
PROTECTION NOTICE NO.2017/38 

Renewal of Customs Broker Licenses 

All customs broker licenses will expire on 30 June 2018. Those customs brokers wanting 
to renew their licence for the next triennium (i.e. from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2021) will 
need to apply for the renewal of their licences. 

Renewal Application 

In March 2018, the Australian Border Force (ABF) will send the ‘Application for renewal 
of Customs Broker Licence’ pack to each customs broker. 

To ensure that the renewal package is sent to the correct postal address, customs 
brokers should check, by no later than 1 February 2018, their contact details in the 
Integrated Cargo System (ICS) are up to date. It is the responsibility of a customs broker 
to ensure that their contact details in the ICS are maintained. 

If a customs broker, wanting to renew their licence, does not receive their renewal 
package by 1 April 2018, it is the responsibility of the broker to advise the Comptroller 
General of Customs, via an email to brokers.licensing@abf.gov.au, that they wish to 
renew their broker licence and facilitate the renewal process.     

Completed renewal applications will be accepted up until close of business on 29 June 
2018 (the due date). However, it is recommended that customs brokers complete and 
return their renewal application as soon as possible to assist with the renewal process. 

A customs broker licence renewal application received after the due date will not be 
processed, resulting in the licence expiring on 30 June 2018. 

Renewal Fee 

Options for the payment of the renewal fee will be listed in the renewal package. Any 
customs broker electing to pay their renewal fee by BPay should take into account the 
delay in processing such payments and that such payments made towards the end of 
June 2018 may not be cleared by the due date. Where a payment is not cleared by the 
due date, the renewal application will be considered incomplete and will not be 
processed.  

Continuing Professional Development 

It is a licence condition that a customs broker, who is a natural person, completes 
Continuing Professional Development (CPD) activities. Each licensed customs broker is 
required to undertake sufficient CPD activity to qualify for a total of 30 points per CPD 
year. 

Licensed customs brokers will gain these points by participating in activities across the 
two available CPD streams. A customs broker may complete all 30 CPD points per CPD 
year from Stream A if they wish, but no more than 12 CPD points can be counted from 
Stream B in any single CPD year.

New low volume import exemptions for equipment containing 
synthetic greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances 

There are now separate low volume import exemptions for equipment containing synthetic 
greenhouse gases (SGGs) and ozone depleting substances (ODSs). 

The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 (OPSGGM 
Act) prohibits the import and export of equipment containing SGGs and ODSs unless the 
importer holds a valid equipment licence issued by the Department of the Environment and 
Energy (DoEE) or qualifies for a low volume import exemption. A list of controlled SGGs and 
ODSs can be found in Schedule 1 of the OPSGGM Act, Schedule 10 of the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and Schedule 15 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) 
Regulations 1958. 

SGG pre-charged equipment – low volume import exemption 

From 1 August 2017, there is a new exemption for low volume import of equipment charged 
with the SGGs, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride 
(SF6). The new threshold allows for the import of up to 25kg of SGGs in total contained in 
equipment in a calendar year. There is no limit on the number of pieces of equipment in a 
consignment or on the number of shipments. An equipment licence will be required from the 
first import that exceeds the 25kg threshold. From 1 January 2018, the SGG low volume 
import exemption will also apply to equipment charged with nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). 

HCFCs pre-charged equipment – ODS low volume import exemption 

The ODS low volume import exemption threshold is as follows:  

 

 

 

there are no more than five units of equipment in a single consignment; 

there is less than 10kg in total of HCFC in the equipment; and  

the importer has not had an import of ODS equipment in the past two years. 

From 1 January 2018, the import of HCFC pre-charged refrigeration and air conditioning 
(RAC) equipment under the ODS low volume exemption is prohibited unless importing 
replacement parts for existing HCFC RAC equipment. 

HCFC pre-charged equipment – personal and household goods exemption 

From 1 January 2020, the ODS low volume exemption will cease and importers will only be 
able to import equipment charged with HCFCs if: 

 

they meet the requirements for the personal and household goods exemption:

NOTICE 

No. 2017/40 
__________________________________________________________ 

Legislation changes to list of controlled synthetic greenhouse 
gases and ozone depleting substances 

Addition of two substances to list of controlled substances 

From 1 January 2018, nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and perfluorocarbon 9-1-18 (PFC-9-1-18) will 
be added to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 
(OPSGGM Act) and consequently to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (PI 
Regulations) and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (PE Regulations), due 
to their high global warming potential and impact on the climate. 

From 1 January 2018, a licence will be required for imports or exports of NF3 and 
PFC- 9- 1- 18 as bulk gas and for imports of equipment containing NF3 and PFC- 9 -1- 18. 

NF3 is used in the electronics industry (semiconductor and LCD manufacture) for plasma 
etching and chamber cleaning processes, and is a replacement for PFCs and sulfur 
hexafluoride (SF6). Uses for PFC-9-1-18 include a limited number of medical applications 
including PFC-based blood substitutes. An exemption from licensing requirements may apply 
for medical and veterinary use. 

Removal of one substance from list of controlled substances 

From 1 August 2017, a licence is no longer required to import or export hydrofluorocarbon-
161 (HFC-161) due to the removal of HFC-161 from schedule 1 of the OPSGGM Act. This 
substance was removed, following a decision at the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal 
Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, not to regulate HFC-161 on the basis of 
its low global warming potential. The subsequent removal of this substance from the PI and 
PE Regulations is effective from 19 December 2017. 

Other minor amendments to the PI and PE Regulations 

In addition to the consequential amendments to add and remove substances to the PI and 
PE Regulations, a number of other related technical amendments were made to harmonise 
definitions, update cross-references to the OPSGGM Act, and include chemical common 
names for perfluorocarbons for consistency with the OPSGGM Act.

No. 2017/41 
________________________________________________________________ 

Hydrofluorocarbons import phase-down 

From 1 January 2018, Australia is phasing down the import of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by gradually 
reducing the maximum amount of bulk HFCs permitted to be imported into Australia. This will be 
managed through a quota system on imports. 

To import bulk HFCs after 31 December 2017, you must hold a controlled substances licence for the 
import of synthetic greenhouse gases and a HFC import quota, both issued by the Department of the 
Environment and Energy (DoEE). 

What the HFC phase-down covers 

The HFC phase-down only applies to bulk imports of HFCs (such as ISO tanks, cylinders and 
canisters), and includes the HFC portion of any blend, which will count towards HFC quota. The HFC 
phase-down does not apply to HFCs imported in pre-charged equipment, such as air-conditioners or 
refrigerators.  

HFC Quota allocation 

The DoEE is responsible for issuing quota and licences for import and export of synthetic greenhouse 
gases. HFC Quota has already been allocated to importers for the 2018–2019 import period. The 
phase-down will have reductions at the start of each two-yearly quota allocation period, aligned with 
licensing periods under the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 
and associated Regulations. The next opportunity to apply for an import quota will be in 2019. 

Enquiries 

Enquiries regarding HFC import quota and controlled substance licences should be directed to the 
Ozone and Synthetic Gas Team in the DoEE, on Phone: +61 2 6274 1373 or by email at 
ozone@environment.gov.au. You can also find further information about the HFC phase-down on the 
DoEE website at https://www.environment.gov.au/protection/ozone/hfc-phase-down.

No. 2017/42

CHANGES TO IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES FOR IMPORTATION OF GOODS

UNDER STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENTS


Purpose

To advise importers of changes to the application of the Import Processing Charge (IPC) to
goods imported under Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA).

From 20 December 2017 the Department of Immigration and Border Protection will no longer
apply the IPC to goods imported under SOFA. These goods are already exempt from the
payment of duties and taxes. Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act)
gives SOFA goods of foreign governments and foreign forces a duty rate of ‘Free’. Under goods
and services tax (GST) legislation, goods imported under Items 10 and 11 of Schedule 4 are
non-taxable importations.

The Customs Act 1901 has been amended to allow the Minister for Immigration and Border
Protection to provide an exemption to goods imported under SOFA, from the application of the
IPC. The IPC is currently payable on the lodgement of any import declaration. The Ministerial
determination to grant this exemption came into effect on 20 December 2017. It does not include
fees and charges applied by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources for its activities,
including inspection and certification of goods, quarantine, and biosecurity.

The exemption will be implemented through the Integrated Cargo System (ICS), applying tariff
classifications for goods of foreign governments and forces and specific SOFA by-laws. Under
Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act, current by-laws relevant to goods imported under SOFA
are:








1300964 – goods for sale by commissaries
1300978 – personal effects subject to the SOFA with Malaysia
1300982 – personal effects subject to the SOFA with New Zealand
1300987 – personal effects subject to the SOFA with Papua New Guinea
1300989 – personal effects subject to the SOFA with Singapore
1300995 – personal effects subject to the SOFA with the United States

To exempt goods imported under SOFA from the application of the IPC the following two new
by-laws have been created:




1700126 – goods imported under SOFA for the official use of foreign governments
1700334 – personal effects of members of foreign forces, their civilian components, and
dependents, pursuant to the SOFA with France

Certain goods imported under SOFA for the official use of foreign governments have been
incorrectly reported under by-laws 1243557 and 1243684, which do not provide an exemption
from the IPC. By-law 1700126 should now be used to report goods imported under SOFA for the
official use of foreign governments.

No. 2017/43 

Revised treatment of gel ball blasters and similar low powered devices 

Regulation 4F of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the Regulations) prohibits 
the importation of firearms into Australia, unless the importer has been granted the appropriate 
permission.  

A recent review of Regulation 4F means that devices that discharge soft and non-dangerous items 
such as soft darts and hydrolysed super-absorbent polymers (gel balls) are no longer classified as 
firearms under the Regulations.  

Where these devices resemble a real firearm, they will be classified as an imitation of a firearm 
under the Regulations. Police Certification issued by state and territory police firearm registries is 
required to import an imitation of a firearm. 

Gel balls (hydrated and non-hydrated) are not considered ammunition under the Regulations and 
are not controlled on import into Australia. 

Plastic 6mm and 8mm BBs for ‘Airsoft’ firearms are considered projectiles, and ‘Airsoft’ firearms 
are still controlled as firearms under the Regulations. 

More information about the importation of these goods is available on the Department’s website at 
www.homeaffairs.gov.au.

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTICE 

No. 2017/44 

Luxury Car Tax Exemption under Item 7 in Schedule 4 of the Customs 
Tarrif Act 1995 

Following an amendment to the A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999, some public 
institutions are eligible to claim an exemption for Luxury Car Tax under Item 7 in Schedule 4 
(Schedule 4) of the Customs Tariff Act 1995. 

With the amendment, public institutions such as museums, galleries or libraries that import a luxury 
car, may be eligible for an exemption if: 

●  the institution is registered for Goods and Services Tax and endorsed as a Deductible Gift Recipient 

●  the car is consigned to the importer 

●  the car is a work of art or collectors’ piece 

●  the car is imported for the sole purpose of public display, and 

●  all conditions for Item 7 in Schedule 4 eligibility have also been met. 

Importers should enter the exemption code ‘OTHR’ when making a claim. 

Exemptions under Items 10, 11, 15, 18, 21 or 24 in Schedule 4 remain unchanged.

Purpose 

To advise arriving persons of changes to by-laws No.1700571 and No.1700581. 

By-laws No.1700571 and No.1700581 are made under section 271 of the Customs Act 1901.  The changes 
to these by-laws, which are effective on and from Thursday 1 February 2018, have been prompted by 
amendments made to the Marriage Act 1961 by the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious 
Freedoms) Act 2017 (the Act). 

The Act removes restrictions that limit marriage in Australia to the union of a man and woman and allows two 
people the freedom to marry in Australia, regardless of their sex or gender. The Act also recognises foreign 
same-sex marriages in Australia.   

New By-law No.1700571 revokes and replaces previous By-law No.1700053 and new By-law No.1700581 
revokes and replaces previous By-law No.1300942.  Both by-laws were made for the purposes of Item 15 of 
Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff Act)  that allows passengers and members of

In addition, amended working pages relating to By-laws No.1700126 and No.1700334 (changes to import 
processing charges for importation of goods under status of forces agreements — see DIBPN No.2017/42 
are also attached to this Notice. 

The Online Tariff has been amended to reflect these changes. 

Changes to the definition of ‘Family’ 

By-law No.1700571 and by-law No.1700581 define ‘Family’ as: 

(a) 2 people who are married, and any of their children; or

(b) a person and his or her de facto partner (within the meaning of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901), and any

of their children.

Replacement of the phrase “permanent resident” with “arriving resident” 

New by-law No.1700581 also replaces the expression “permanent resident” with the expression “arriving 
resident” to avoid inconsistency with Australian migration legislation. “Arriving resident” means a person who 
arrives in Australia and intends immediately to take up or resume residence in Australia; and 

(a) is an Australian citizen for the purposes of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 (as amended from time to

time); or

(b) holds a permanent visa within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958 (as amended from time to time); or

(c) holds a special category visa within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958 (as amended from time to

time).

Department of Home Affairs

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTICE 
No. 2018/02 

Amendments to the Customs Act 1901 – Tariff Concession System 

This notice is to explain legislative changes to the Tariff Concession System (TCS) and to advise importers 
and local manufacturers to use the correct forms with effect from 1 February 2018.   

The Customs and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2017 (Amendment Act) took effect on 5 April 2017. The 
Amendment Act contains changes to the requirements concerning the revocation and objection to the 
making of tariff concession orders (TCOs) under the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act).  

Specifically, these changes are: 

•  Removal of the requirement that 25 per cent or more of the factory or work costs of the goods must be 
incurred in Australia for goods to be taken to be produced in Australia. The new subsection 269D(1) 
provides that goods are taken to be produced in Australia if they are wholly or partly manufactured in 
Australia. For partly manufactured goods, at least one substantial process in the manufacture of the 
substitutable goods must be carried out in Australia. Incidental provisions (subsection 269D(4) and (5)) 
have also been repealed as a result of this change.  

•  Clarification of the requirement in relation to substitutable goods that are made-to-order capital 

equipment. The amended subsection 269E(2) emphasises the capacity of the manufacturer to produce 
the made-to-order capital equipment with existing facilities, rather than actual production of such goods 
by the producer in the past. Actual production would, of course, demonstrate the capacity to produce 
substitutable goods, but is not required. 

•  The timeframe that an Australian manufacturer must have made goods (substitutable goods that are 

made-to-order capital equipment), requiring the same labour skills, technology and design expertise as 
the subject of a TCO, has been extended from two years to five years under subsection 269E(2)(c).  

Consistent with the Australian Government’s deregulation agenda, these changes reduce the regulatory 
burden on Australian manufacturers and simplify the test under which goods are taken to have been 
produced in Australia. The extension of the timeframe in relation to made-to-order capital equipment benefits 
Australian manufacturers by allowing for a longer period to demonstrate their capabilities to produce the 
substitutable goods. 

The relevant forms have been updated to reflect the legislative changes and they are available from the 
Department’s website at www.homeaffairs.gov.au. The new forms for TCO applications, objections to the 
making of TCO applications and requests for revocation of existing TCOs must be used from  
1 February 2018. Old forms are accepted prior to this date; however, information relating to the requirement 
of “25 per cent or more of the factory or work costs of the goods be incurred in Australia” is not required.

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS 
NOTICE No.2018/03

Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods 
on 5 February 2018 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, beers 
and fuel products, operative from 5 February 2018.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act), provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is 
calculated by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June 
or December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. 

On 31 January 2018, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December 2017 Quarter figure (112.1). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for February 2018 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 

December Quarter 2017 

June Quarter 2017 

Indexation factor 

112.1 

110.7 

1.013 

As the indexation factor for February 2018 (1.013) is greater than one, customs duty for certain excise-
equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff, will be increased by the application of this factor.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 5 February 2018, are set out in 
Table 1 and supersede the rates outlined in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection 
Notice 2017/20. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:  

•  Schedule 4A (Singaporean originating goods)  
•  Schedule 5 (US originating goods)  
•  Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods)  
•  Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods)  
•  Schedule 8 (ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand originating goods)  
•  Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods)  
•  Schedule 10 (Korean originating goods)  
•  Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods) and  
•  Schedule 12 (Chinese originating goods) in the Customs Tariff Act.

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS 
NOTICE No.2018/05

Biannual indexation of customs duty rates for certain tobacco and 
tobacco products – 1 March 2018

In accordance with the indexation provisions set out below, the excise-equivalent customs duty rates on 
certain tobacco and tobacco products, in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff 
Act), will increase on 1 March 2018. 

Indexation provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate 

Section 19AC of the Customs Tariff Act provides for the excise-equivalent customs duty rate applied to 
tobacco products classified to tariff subheadings where the amount of customs duty is determined on a 
‘per stick’ basis to be indexed biannually, in March and September, to the average weekly ordinary time 
earnings (AWOTE).  

Indexation provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco 
content’ rate 

Section 19ACA of the Customs Tariff Act provides for the excise-equivalent customs duty rates to be 
applied to tobacco products classified to tariff subheadings where the amount of customs duty is 
determined on a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ basis. This section provides for these 
rates to be adjusted biannually, in March and September, at the same time that the ‘per stick’ rate is 
indexed. The new rate for these goods is determined by dividing the ‘per stick’ rate by the weight 
conversion factor that applies for the 12 month period commencing on 1 September of the relevant year. 

Calculation of excise-equivalent customs duty rates operative from 1 March 2018 

On 22 February 2018, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the AWOTE figure for the 
December Quarter 2017 (1569.60). The AWOTE indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most 
recent AWOTE figure by the highest AWOTE figure for a previous June or December Quarter that does 
not precede the 2012 December Quarter. 

The figures used to calculate the AWOTE indexation factor and the excise-equivalent customs duty 
rates that apply from 1 March 2018 are set out in the table below:

Department of Home Affairs

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS 
NOTICE No.2018/07

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 2018-2019 

The Department of Home Affairs (the Department) will shortly contact Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme 
holders to discuss quota allocations for 2018-2019. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in 
the 23-month period ending 31 May 2018, as shown in the Department’s records of Import Declarations 
lodged between 01 July 2016 and 31 May 2018. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, 
importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the 
financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd 
importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under 
Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, then the quota cannot be used.  Similarly, if preference 
circumstances or Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) apply, then the quota is not available.  

Pursuant to subsections 71A(7) and (8) of the Customs Act 1901, the cheese or curd is ‘entered for home 
consumption’ on the latter of the following two dates: 

(a) 
(b) 

the date of original lodgment;  
the date of the arrival of the vessel or aircraft at the first Australian port or airport at which any cargo 
is intended to be discharged. 

Please note that: 

 

 

The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer during the 23-
month period or that remains unused at 31 May 2018 

For the 2019-20 allocation period, the allocation will be calculated by the sum of:  

a)  all quota entered for home consumption in 2017-18, and 
b)  all quota entered for home consumption between 01 July 2018 and 31 May 2019 

NB. Good entered for home consumption between 01 June and 30 June 2019 will be included in the 
2020-2021 allocation

Background 

The Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 and the CTD Regulation set out labelling requirements at the 
border for the importation of certain goods. A Court has discretion to apply a penalty of up to 50 penalty units 
where a person is found guilty of contravening or failing to comply with the CTD Regulation. The penalty is 
consistent with Commonwealth Government guidelines (Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, 
Infringement Notices and Enforcement Powers).

On 4 April 2018 Schedule 4 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (PI Regulations) and 
Schedule 8 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (PE Regulations) were updated to: 

●  ensure Australia’s continuing compliance with international treaties on narcotic drugs, including the United 

Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, 

●  harmonise border controls with Schedule 4 of the Criminal Code Regulations 2002 (Border Controlled 

Drugs), and 

●  include new synthetic drugs, which may pose a risk to public health. 

The details of new substances included in Schedule 4 of the PI Regulations, including border classification 
are provided at Attachment A.  

The details of new substances included in Schedule 8 of the PE Regulations, including border classification 
are provided at Attachment B.  

Item 35 of Schedule 4 of the PI Regulations has also been amended to update the term ‘Cannabis’ to 
‘Cannabis, including extracts and tinctures of cannabis’.  This clarifies that cannabis containing products are 
also subject to border controls.   

A further amendment to the PI Regulations is the rescheduling of anabolic and androgenic substances from 
Schedule 8 to Schedule 7A. This amendment clarifies that anabolic and androgenic substances may be 
brought into Australia as part of personal baggage without special permission, provided all other traveller 
exemption requirements are met (see: https://www.odc.gov.au/travellers).

Trade and Customs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) 
Regulations 2018 

This notice outlines amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation 1956 (Prohibited Imports 
Regulation) and the Customs Regulation 2015 (Customs Regulation) which commenced on 4 April 2018. 

Unmanufactured tobacco and tobacco refuse 

Amendments were made to the Prohibited Imports Regulation to ensure that Regulation 4D includes all 
types of unmanufactured tobacco products and tobacco refuse included in heading 2401 to Schedule 3 of 
the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The specific provisions amended were:  

• 

the heading for Regulation 4D 

•  subregulation 4D (1) 

•  paragraphs 4D (1)(a) and (b), and 

•  paragraph (5)(b). 

These amendments align the import prohibition on unmanufactured tobacco with the licensing requirements 
for the production, manufacture and dealing of unmanufactured tobacco under the Excise Act 1901 (the 
Excise Act). This will ensure that no unmanufactured tobacco can be imported into Australia without proof of 
an Excise Act licence. The amendments also streamline border processing by ensuring that all 
unmanufactured tobacco products and refuse are treated consistently.  

Repeal of refund reason 

Amendments were made to the Customs Regulation to repeal a redundant customs duty refund 
circumstance attributable to the period between 1 July 2014 and 17 July 2014 as a result of the Customs 
Tariff Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Act 2014.  Repealed sections include: 

• 

table item 4 of clause 1 of Schedule 6  

•  subsections 109(2) and 112(7) of the Customs Regulation, and  

• 

table item 20 of clause 1 of Schedule 6. 

Temporary importation of goods 

A minor amendment was made to paragraph 99(3)(b) of the Customs Regulation to certain classes of goods 
that may be temporarily imported into Australia without the payment of duty or taxes under section 162 of the 
Customs Act 1901. This amendment clarifies that goods may be temporarily imported for public exhibition or 
public entertainment.

Amendments to Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 – 
Defence and Strategic Goods 

Regulation 13E of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (the Regulations) prohibits 
the export of goods listed on the Defence and Strategic Goods List (the DSGL) unless permission 
has been granted or an exemption applies. 

The Customs (Prohibited Exports) Amendment (Defence and Strategic Goods) Regulations 2018, 
which came into effect on 21 April 2018, has replaced regulation 13E of the Regulations with new 
regulations 13E to 13EK. These amendments were introduced to align the defence and strategic 
goods provisions of the Regulations with the Defence Trade Controls Act 2012.  

Goods listed on the DSGL remain controlled on export and goods containing DSGL technology are 
now explicitly prohibited from export unless permission has been granted, or an exemption applies. 
The new regulations also include enhanced powers for the Minister for Defence to revoke a permit 
where it is determined that an export would prejudice the security, defence or international 
relations of Australia. 

The Department of Defence has published more detailed information on its website about the 
regulation amendments (see: http://www.defence.gov.au/ExportControls).

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTICE 

No. 2018/13 

Goods and Services Tax on low value imported goods 

From 1 July 2018, goods with a customs value of AUD1,000 or less (low value goods) may attract the Goods 
and Services Tax (GST) at point of sale if imported from overseas by consumers in Australia. GST will not be 
charged on the sale of low value goods imported by Australian GST-registered businesses for use in their 
business in Australia (i.e. business to business sales) or on GST-free goods. 

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will administer the collection of GST from vendors and will undertake 
compliance and implementation activities. For GST purposes, sales of low value goods to consumers in 
Australia will be treated like domestic sales and not importations. This means, that vendors with sales of 
AUD75,000 or more (subject to Australian GST) to consumers in Australia in a 12-month period will need to 
register with the ATO, collect GST at the point of sale and remit that GST to the ATO.  

This includes businesses that are: 

●  merchants who sell goods to consumers; 

●  electronic distribution platform operators such as websites that provide a marketplace for merchants

●  re-deliverers – businesses that are engaged by consumers to provide shopping or mailbox services. For 
example, this would include a service that offers consumers a specific mailing address overseas, and 
then repackages and forwards the goods onto the consumer1. 

There are rules that determine which entity will need to register for, and charge GST. Further information on 
GST registration is available on the ATO website at www.ato.gov.au/AusGST.  

There will be no changes to:

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTICE 

No. 2018/14 

Goods and Services Tax on low value imported goods – Use of the  
GST-paid exemption code 

This notice should be read in conjunction with Department of Home Affairs Notices 2018/13 and 2018/15. 

From 1 July 2018, goods with a customs value of AUD1,000 or less (low value goods) may attract the Goods 
and Services Tax (GST) at point of sale if imported from overseas by consumers in Australia.  

To assist vendors with their reporting requirements, the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) will allow for a 
Vendor ID, Importer ID and the use of a GST exemption code ‘PAID’, where applicable. The GST-paid 
exemption code is for use in specific circumstances to help prevent double taxation. Goods imported in a 
consignment of AUD1,000 or less will not require the use of the GST-paid exemption code.  

For low value goods that form part of a consignment with a customs value over AUD1,000, the GST-paid 
exemption code should be used to identify those items for which GST has been paid at the point of sale to 
avoid GST being charged again at the border. Existing GST exemption codes should continue to be used, 
where applicable, for goods that are GST exempt.  

The GST-paid exemption code cannot be used for imports of tobacco, tobacco products and alcoholic 
beverages. These goods are liable for customs duty and taxes at the border, regardless of value. The  
GST-paid exemption code cannot be used for goods with a customs value over AUD1,000 (these goods are 
liable for GST at the border), other than in Scenario 3 below.  

Where the GST-paid exemption code is not used on import documents, and GST is charged again on the 
low value good at the border, refunds must be sought from the vendor. Refunds will not be available from the 
Department of Home Affairs, Australian Taxation Office (ATO), transporter or brokerage service. For details 
see Home Affairs Notice No. 2018/15 - Claiming a GST refund. 

Examples 

Scenario 1 

A number of low value goods are purchased overseas and the vendor charges GST on each item. 
The goods are then sent in one consignment with a total customs value over AUD1,000. 

In this scenario, the following applies:  

●  a Full Import Declaration is required for the importation of the goods as the customs value is over 

AUD1,000; and 

●  the GST-paid exemption code should be used on all tariff lines where GST has been paid to the vendor at 

the point of sale.

No. 2018/15 

Goods and Services Tax on low value imported goods – Claiming a GST 
refund 

This notice should be read in conjunction with Department of Home Affairs Notices 2018/13 and 2018/14. 

From 1 July 2018, goods with a customs value of AUD1,000 or less (low value goods) may attract the Goods 
and Services Tax (GST) at point of sale if imported from overseas by consumers in Australia.  

Ensuring accurate reporting on import documentation and in the Integrated Cargo System will assist in 
preventing double taxation at the border, this includes: 

●  Vendor ID (GST registration number), 

●  Importer ID (importer’s Australian Business Number), and  

●  where applicable, a GST-paid exemption code to identify when GST has been paid at the point of sale. 

Where the GST-paid exemption code is not used on import documents, and GST is charged again on the 
low value good at the border, refunds must be sought from the vendor. Refunds will not be available from the 
Department of Home Affairs, Australian Taxation Office, transporter or brokerage service.  

To seek a refund of GST, consumers will need to provide a receipt or import declaration advice to show that 
they have paid GST at the border. Vendors will need to ensure that any refunds of GST are reported through 
the adjustment process when remitting GST to the ATO. 

In addition, the GST rules that apply to goods returned in Australia’s domestic market also apply for returned 
low value imported goods. This means that if a consumer returns the goods to the vendor, and is provided a 
refund, they are also entitled to a refund of the GST from the vendor. 

Further information for consumers is available on the ATO website at www.ato.gov.au/AusGST.

No. 2018/24

Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods on 
1 August 2018 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, beers 
and fuel products, operative from 1 August 2018.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act), provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is 
calculated by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June 
or December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. 

On 25 July 2018, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June 2018 Quarter figure (113.0). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for August 2018 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter

December Quarter 2017 

Indexation factor 

113.0 

112.1 

1.008 

As the indexation factor for August 2018 (1.008) is greater than one, customs duty for certain 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff, will be increased by the application of this 
factor.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 1 August 2018, are set out in Table 1 
and supersede the rates outlined in the Department of Home Affairs Notice 2018/03. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:

No. 2018/25 

Exposure draft of the Customs Amendment (Collecting Tobacco Duties 
at the Border) Bill 2018 for public consultation 

In the 2018-19 Budget, the Australian Government announced the Black Economy Package — combating 
illicit tobacco. The package cracks down on the illicit tobacco trade with the establishment of the Illicit 
Tobacco Taskforce, a new framework to protect tobacco duty, and further resources to combat illegal 
domestic production of tobacco.  

The measure to collect tobacco duties at the border requires amendments to the Customs Act 1901 
(Customs Act) and the Excise Act 1901. This is split across two Bills. The Bill led by the Minister for Law 
Enforcement and Cyber Security will require importers of tobacco to pay all duties and taxes upon 
importation. The Bill led by the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services will require excise on 
domestically grown tobacco to be paid at the time of manufacture.  

Both Bills have been made available for public comment prior to proposed introduction in the 2018 Spring 
Parliamentary Sittings. The Customs Amendment (Collecting Tobacco Duties at the Border) Bill 2018 (the 
Bill) proposes to amend the Customs Act to:











Require importers to pay all import duties on tobacco when the tobacco enters the country from
1 July 2019. From that date, the option to enter tobacco into a licensed warehouse to delay paying
import duties will no longer be available.

Cease current weekly settlement arrangements for imported tobacco, and provide for any such
weekly settlement arrangements that were in force before the commencement of the legislation to
have no effect in respect of periods after 1 July 2019.

Provide that any movement permissions that were in force before the commencement of the new
legislation, and that permitted the movement of tobacco products between warehouses, to no
longer be in effect.

Provide for transitional arrangements for tobacco products that are still in warehouses
on 1 July 2019. Under the transitional arrangements, owners of those tobacco products will
effectively be required to enter them for home consumption on 1 July 2019 and pay the outstanding
duty, or provide a security for the duty, within 7 days after 1 July 2019.

Provide that if actions under the transitional arrangements do not occur, the tobacco products may
be disposed of, including by destruction. Owners of tobacco products in duty free stores and in
warehouses which are exclusively used to supply aircraft or ship stores on 1 July 2019 will be
exempt from these arrangements, and can continue to store duty free tobacco products.

Transhipments and duty free sales of tobacco will be able to continue after 1 July 2019. 

The measures set out in the Bills are vital for disrupting illicit tobacco supply chains and denying organised 
crime groups access to profits from illicit tobacco to fund criminal activity and undermine community safety.

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS 
NOTICE No.2018/26

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 2018-2019 

The Department of Home Affairs has determined the 2018-19 allocations under the Cheese and Curd Quota 
Scheme, which it administers on behalf of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. The 
allocation was gazetted on 04 July 2018 in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette - Tariff Concessions No. 
2018/25. 

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 23-month 
period ending 31 May 2018, as shown in departmental records of clearances for home consumption.  This 
calculation excludes any part of the quota that was transferred to another importer during the 23-month 
period or that was unused as at 31 May 2018. 

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, importers 
are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the financial year 
to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of 
Australian origin (returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the 
Customs Tariff Act 1995; preference circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) exist, quota is 
unable to be used. 

The cheese or curd is considered to be ‘entered for home consumption’ if: 

(a)
of Home Affairs, and

an import declaration, which identifies item 55, for the goods is lodged with the Department

(b)
airport for the discharge of cargo.

the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port or

Quota allocations are transferable between importers.  A person may apply to transfer quota entitlements by 
completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) available at

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS 
NOTICE No.2018/27 
Amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 – 
Schedule 2 Rotterdam Convention chemicals 

Two new chemicals added 

With effect from 30 June 2018, two pesticide chemicals, carbofuran and trichlorfon, have been added to the 
list of prohibited chemicals in Schedule 2 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (the PE 
Regulations).  

Under Regulation 4A of the PE Regulations, chemicals listed in Schedule 2 are prohibited exports from 
Australia, unless permission has been granted by the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources or an 
authorised officer from the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (DAWR), under the Agricultural 
and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Regulations 1995 (the AVCA Regulations).  

These amendments give effect to the listing of these chemicals in an amendment to Annex III of the 
Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and 
Pesticides in International Trade (the Convention). The convention applies to banned or severely restricted 
chemicals and severely hazardous pesticides. 

Australia ratified the Convention on 20 May 2004 and the present amendment is a minor treaty action for 
Australia, which was endorsed by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on 26 March 2018. 

Amendments were also made to the AVCA Regulations to add these two chemicals as controlled chemicals 
as per the Convention. 

These amendments ensure that Australia meets its obligations under the Convention to comply with the 
import decisions of other participating parties.  

Other minor amendments to Schedule 2 of the PE Regulations 

These other amendments include the creation of Part 1—Chemicals and Part 2—Mixture or preparation 
containing chemicals to Schedule 2 of the PE Regulations. The two parts provide a distinction between 
chemicals in pure form and chemicals listed as a component of a mixture or preparation in varying levels of 
concentration. 

For further information on applying for permission to export chemicals that are controlled under Schedule 2 
of the PE Regulations or the AVCA Regulations, please visit the Department of Agriculture and Water 
Resources website.

Department of Home Affairs

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTICE 

No. 2018/28

Biannual indexation of customs duty rates for tobacco 
and tobacco products – 1 September 2018 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco 
products, operative from 1 September 2018. 

Indexation provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate 

Sections 19AB and 19AC of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides for biannual indexation, 
in March and September, of the excise-equivalent customs duty rates applied to tobacco products where the 
amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis. In September the rates are indexed by the average 
weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) indexation factor and then an additional 12.5 per cent indexation factor. 
The additional indexation factor will apply to September indexation until 2020. 

Adjustments for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ rate 

Section 19ACA of the Customs Tariff Act provides for biannual adjustments of the excise-equivalent customs 
duty rates applied to tobacco products where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per kilogram’ or 
a ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ basis. The new rate is determined by dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ rate by 
the weight conversion factor which applies for a 12 month period commencing on 1 September. The new rate 
commences at the same time as the indexed ‘per stick’ rate.  

Calculation of excise-equivalent customs duty rates operative from 1 September 2018 

On 16 August 2018, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the AWOTE figure for the June quarter 2018 
(1585.3). The AWOTE Indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most recent AWOTE figure by the highest 
AWOTE figure for a previous June or December quarter that does not precede the 2012 December quarter. 

The AWOTE indexation factor is only applied when it is greater than 1. The 12.5 per cent additional indexation 
factor is applied to all September indexations. 

The figures used to calculate the excise-equivalent customs duty rates that apply from 1 September 2018 are 
set out in the table below: 

Most recent 
AWOTE 

June Quarter 2018

1.125 

0.00075 

As the indexation factor for August 2018 (1.010) is greater than one, the excise-equivalent customs duty rates 
for tobacco products subject to the ‘per stick’ rate will be increased by the application of the indexation factor

NOTICE No. 2018/30 

Change to Chinese issuing authority for 
Certificates of Origin under China-Australia Free 
Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) 

The General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China (GACC) has advised that the 
responsibilities of the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the 
People’s Republic of China (AQSIQ) has recently been integrated into the GACC and that from  
20 August 2018 the activities of AQSIQ will be completed by the GACC.  

From 20 August 2018, the GACC will be issuing Certificates of Origin (CoO) under the ChAFTA.  CoOs 
issued by AQSIQ prior to 20 August 2018 will remain effective for their duration of validity as per  
ChAFTA Article 14.4 of Chapter 3 (Rules Of Origin).  The full text of the ChAFTA is available on the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Free Trade Agreement website (dfat.gov.au) for reference.  

Customs Brokers and Importers will notice a change in the issuing authority stamp in box 14 of the ChAFTA 
CoO. 

The new stamps will be issued by one of the GACC 42 Customs Districts within China (GACC will not appear 
on the stamp). Each of the GACC 42 districts has its own stamp. CoOs will have the local Customs 
authorised body as the stamp. The AQSIQ prefix has also been removed from number the bottom of the 
certificate. 

Customs Brokers and Importers who have a concern about issuing authority stamp should send a copy of 
the CoO to the Origin and Verification Team. The Origin and Verification Team will be able to advise if the 
Certificate of Origin can be used to claim preferential tariff treatment under ChAFTA. 

Certificates of Origin issued by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) and its 
regional branches will not be changed and remain valid. 

There remains two authorised bodies for issuing ChAFTA Certificates of Origin in China: the GACC and 
CCPIT.

No. 2018/35

Amendments to the Customs Act 1901 – Collecting tobacco duties at 
the border 

The Australian Government introduced a set of measures to combat the illicit tobacco trade as part of the 
2018-19 Budget ‘Black Economy Package – combatting illicit tobacco’. The package includes a measure 
removing the option for importers to enter tobacco products into a licensed warehouse. Legislation enabling 
this measure has passed Parliament and will take effect from 1 July 2019. 

Specific legislative changes include: 





From 1 July 2019, importers will be required to pay import duty on tobacco products upon
importation into Australia – no exceptions will be available. From that date, the option to enter
tobacco products into a licensed warehouse without the payment of import duties will no longer be
available.

From 1 July 2019, it will no longer be possible for duty to be paid on tobacco products on a weekly or
monthly basis in accordance with permissions granted under section 69 of the Customs Act 1901.
Any such permissions that are in force prior to 1 July 2019 will have no effect in respect of periods
after 1 July 2019.

 Movement permissions to allow the movement of tobacco products to or from warehouses will cease
on 1 July 2019. However, movement permissions that do not relate to warehouses will continue to
be granted after this date to allow tobacco products to be moved, including between wharves and
customs depots. Movement permissions for duty free stores or warehouses exclusively used to
supply aircraft’s stores or ship’s stores will be reissued as required.





Special arrangements will apply to tobacco products that are still in warehouses on 1 July 2019.
Owners of these tobacco products will be required to enter them for home consumption on that date
and pay the outstanding duties. Arrangements may be available, provided a security is issued, to
pay the outstanding duty over the following 12 months (final payment by 30 June 2020). Owners of
tobacco products who do neither of these things may have their tobacco products disposed of.

o The value of security that will be required is currently being assessed and will be

communicated to importers closer to 1 July 2019. The value of the security will be based on
anticipated stock levels at 1 July 2019.

Tobacco products intended for export that are in duty free stores or warehouses exclusively used to
supply aircraft’s stores or ship’s stores on 1 July 2019 will be exempt from these transitional
arrangements.

o From 1 July 2019, tobacco importers may on-sell imported tobacco to duty free operators.
Importers may apply for a refund from the Department of Home Affairs (Home Affairs) for
duties and taxes paid at the border.

Department of Home Affairs

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTICE 

No. 2018/39 

Customs Amendment (Product Specific Rule Modernisation) Act 2018 

The Customs Amendment (Product Specific Rule Modernisation) Act 2018 (the Amendment Act) 
commences on 14 December 2018. 

The Amendment Act makes technical amendments to the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) to simplify the 
way that changes to product specific rules (PSRs) are given legal effect in customs legislation. The 
Amendment Act also makes a number of minor amendments to the Customs Act to implement provisions in 
various free trade agreements. 

The full text of the Amendment Act and explanatory material is available on the Federal Register of 
Legislation (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018A00151). 

New approach to giving legal effect to PSRs in customs legislation 

The changes made by the Amendment Act will automatically give legal effect to any new or revised PSRs 
agreed to in the future under the following agreements: 

• 

• 

• 

the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA); 

the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement; and 

the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement. 

The changes made by the Amendment Act apply the PSRs for each of these agreements by direct reference 
in the Customs Act. This removes the need to prescribe the PSRs in regulations. This legislative structure is 
consistent with that used to implement the Agreement to Amend the Singapore-Australia Free Trade 
Agreement and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. 

The chemical rules for the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement have also been applied by reference 
in the Customs Act. 

The substance of the PSRs have not been changed by the Amendment Act. 

Claiming preferential treatment 

For importers and customs brokers the only change to the process of claiming preferential tariff treatment will 
be the document used to identify the PSR that applies to their good. Following the commencement of the 
Amendment Act the definitive source of PSRs will be the official text of that agreement. The PSRs will be 
repealed from the agreement specific regulations. 

The text of the agreements are available on the Department of Foreign Affairs website 
(https://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/in-force/Pages/free-trade-agreements-in-force.aspx) and on the 
Australian Treaties Database (http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/index.html). 

The Department of Home Affairs will issue a Department of Home Affairs Notice to inform importers and 
customs brokers of upcoming changes to PSRs.

Working Tariff and other changes commencing on 1 January 2019 

Reduction of preferential customs duty rates 

The next scheduled reduction of preferential customs duty rates will occur on 1 January 2019 for the 
following agreements: 







the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA);

the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP);

the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA); and

the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA).

A full schedule of reductions under these free trade agreements is provided in the Online Tariff 
(https://archive.homeaffairs.gov.au/busi/cargo-support-trade-and-goods/importing-goods/tariff-classification-
of-goods/current-tariff-classification) and the Tariff Working Pages for Schedule 8 (AANZFTA), Schedule 8B 
(TPP-11), Schedule 10 (KAFTA) and Schedule 12 (ChAFTA). 

As these reduction are already incorporated into the working pages, no new pages will be issued. 

AANZFTA Product Specific Rules 

On 1 January 2019 new AANZFTA Product Specific Rules will enter into force. The new AANZFTA Product 
Specific Rules use the nomenclature of the 2017 Harmonized System. The Product Specific Rules are in 
Annex 2 to AANZFTA (https://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/in-force/aanzfta/official-
documents/Pages/official-documents.aspx).  

Consistent with the changes made by the Customs Amendment (Product Specific Rule Modernisation) 
Act 2018, the Product Specific Rules for AANZFTA are no longer implemented through regulations. The 
changes made by this Act are covered in Department of Home Affairs Notice No. 2018/39. 

Import and export statistical code changes 

There will be no 1 January 2019 statistical code changes for imports and exports.

No. 2019/03

Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods on 
4 February 2019 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, beers 
and fuel products, operative from 4 February 2019.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act), provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is 
calculated by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June 
or December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. 

On 30 January 2019, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December 2018 Quarter figure (114.1). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for February 2019 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 

June Quarter 2018 

December Quarter 2018 

Indexation factor 

113.0 

114.1 

1.010 

As the indexation factor for February 2019 (1.010) is greater than one, customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff, will be increased by the application of this 
factor.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 4 February 2019, are set out in 
Table 1 and supersede the rates outlined in Department of Home Affairs Notice 2018/24. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTICE 

No. 2019/04

Differentiated examination benefit for Trusted Traders 

Australian Trusted Trader reduces red tape for Trusted Traders at the border, improves certainty in export 
markets, and expedites the flow of their cargo in and out of Australia, which means faster access to market. 
Administered by Home Affairs with the Australian Border Force, Trusted Trader is free and accredits 
Australian businesses with compliant trade practices and a secure supply chain. Once accredited, 
businesses have access to a growing range of benefits that simplify their customs processes. 

Fundamental to supporting a lighter touch at the border for Trusted Traders, differentiated examinations for 
cargo has now been entrenched and automated in departmental processes and systems.  

A lighter touch reflects the thorough accreditation process and a comprehensive compliance and monitoring 
framework which Trusted Traders are subject to. Through demonstrating supply chain security and compliant 
trade practices, Trusted Traders are able to access a range of benefits through the Australian Trusted Trader 
(ATT) program.   

Changes to import documentation requirements for Trusted Traders 

Trusted Traders are required to ensure that their import documentation includes their Australian Business 
Number (ABN) on the Cargo Report. The ABN is a critical piece of information to ensure the cargo is 
identified as belonging to a Trusted Trader and receives the benefit.   

Action required by companies reporting cargo 

You are required to ensure that the correct ABN of all importers are declared on the Cargo Report. 

Further information 

For more technical information about this benefit please refer to https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-

No. 2019/07 

Biannual indexation of customs duty rates for tobacco  
and tobacco products – 1 March 2019 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco 
products, operative from 1 March 2019. 

Indexation provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate 

Sections 19AB and 19AC of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides for biannual indexation, 
in March and September, of the excise-equivalent customs duty rates applied to tobacco products where the 
amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis. In September the rates are indexed by the average 
weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) indexation factor and then an additional 12.5 per cent indexation factor. 
The additional indexation factor will apply to each September indexation until 2020. 

Adjustments for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ rate 

Section 19ACA of the Customs Tariff Act provides for biannual adjustments of the excise-equivalent customs 
duty rates applied to tobacco products where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per kilogram’ or 
a ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ basis. The new rate is determined by dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ rate by 
the weight conversion factor which applies for a 12 month period commencing on 1 September. The new rate 
commences at the same time as the indexed ‘per stick’ rate.  

Calculation of excise-equivalent customs duty rates operative from 1 March 2019 

On 21 February 2019, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the AWOTE figure for the December 
Quarter 2019 (1605.5). The AWOTE Indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most recent AWOTE figure 
by the highest AWOTE figure for a previous June or December quarter that does not precede the 
2012 December Quarter. 

The AWOTE indexation factor is only applied when it is greater than 1. The 12.5 per cent additional indexation 
factor is applied to all September indexations. 

The figures used to calculate the excise-equivalent customs duty rates that apply from 1 March 2019 are set

2019-04-15,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2019-10.pdf,Prescription of asbestos as a Tier 1 good,"DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTICE 

No. 2019/10 

Prescription of asbestos as a Tier 1 good  

From 26 March 2019, asbestos, and goods containing asbestos, are prescribed as Tier 1 Goods (table item 24 
under subclause 1(1) of Schedule 7 of the Customs Regulation 2015). 

As a result, and as an alternative to the offence under section 233 of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act), 
the unlawful importation and exportation of asbestos can be prosecuted as an offence relating to Tier 1 goods 
under subsections 233BAA(4) and (5) of the Customs Act. 

For further information regarding these changes please consult the legislation directly, including the explanatory 
statement located at: www.legislation.gov.au.  

Penalties for the unlawful importation or exportation of asbestos 

The Australian Government will consider the evidence available in deciding whether to prosecute an asbestos 
border offence as a Tier 1 criminal offence under section 233BAA of the Customs Act, or the alternative strict 
liability offence under section 233.  

A person convicted of an offence against section 233 of the Customs Act is punishable by a fine not exceeding 
1000 penalty units (currently AUD210,000) or three times the value of the goods, whichever is the greater.  

A person convicted of an offence under section 233BAA is punishable by a fine not exceeding 1000 penalty units 
and/or imprisonment for up to five years. 

When a body corporate is found guilty of an offence against section 233, or section 233BAA, the court may 
impose a fine of up to 5000 penalty units (AUD1,050,000) or 15 times the value of the goods, whichever is the 
greater, through application of section 4B(3) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 

The prescription of asbestos as a Tier 1 good enhances the existing suite of sanctions available to the Australian 
Border Force (ABF) for asbestos border offences. The ABF may issue fines under the Customs Act Infringement 
Notice Scheme in lieu of prosecution where considered appropriate. 

The importance of supply chain management 

Importers and exporters need to be aware of the risk of asbestos entering their supply chain for a range of goods, 
regardless of their country of origin. The Department of Home Affairs and the ABF have significantly increased 
the amount of guidance information to assist voluntary compliance with the asbestos border control. 

If goods at the border are suspected of containing asbestos, they may be held for examination, including 
sampling and testing. Associated costs, including storage pending the testing outcome, are the responsibility of 
the owner regardless of whether or not asbestos is detected.  

The important role of border industry members 

Licensed Customs Brokers, freight forwarders and other border industry members have an important role in 
raising awareness of the asbestos border control with their clients. Border industry members are best placed to 
identify goods at risk of containing asbestos moving across the border, and to inform their clients of the potential

No. 2019/11 

Asbestos - changes to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 

From 26 March 2019, amendments take effect to the export prohibition for asbestos. Outdated provisions and 
references to repealed legislation have been removed, and the definition of asbestos for the purposes of the 
export prohibition has been better aligned with Australia’s domestic work, health and safety legislation. 

The exportation of asbestos, and goods containing asbestos, is controlled under Regulation 4 and Schedule 1 of 
the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (PE Regulations). 

For further information on the changes to the asbestos border control please consult the updated legislation, 
including the explanatory statement located at: www.legislation.gov.au. 

New definition of asbestos 

The definition of asbestos under the PE Regulations is amended to align with the definition of asbestos under the 
Work, Health and Safety Regulations 2011 (Cth). That is, asbestos means the asbestiform varieties of mineral 
silicates belonging to the following serpentine or amphibole groups of rock forming minerals: 

  actinolite asbestos; 

  grunerite (or amosite) asbestos (brown); 

  anthophyllite asbestos; 

 

 

 

chrysotile asbestos (white); 

crocidolite asbestos (blue); 

tremolite asbestos; or 

  a mixture that contains one or more of the minerals referred above. 

As a result, only asbestiform asbestos is controlled at the border. 

Laboratory reports from testing undertaken overseas that list a mineral silicate of the same name as in the list 
above must demonstrate that the mineral identified is of a non-asbestiform variety. 

Amendments to the export prohibition 

The amendments have removed provisions which previously enabled the Safety, Rehabilitation and 
Compensation Commission, and the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority to issue 
exemptions to the asbestos export prohibition. 

The amendments empower the Minister to grant permission to export asbestos, and goods containing asbestos, 
from certain Australian external Territories to the mainland, to enable disposal in a state or territory. 

  Asbestos intended to be shipped from Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands to 

the mainland requires an export permission for the asbestos to leave the external Territory in addition to 
an import permission for the mainland. These territories are subject to customs ordinances which 
extend the application of the Customs Act 1901 and associated regulations. 

  Other external Territories have various arrangements, and asbestos exportation will be controlled within 

those existing frameworks.

Asbestos – changes to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956  

From 26 March 2019, amendments take effect to the import prohibition for asbestos. Outdated provisions and 
references to repealed legislation have been removed, and the definition of asbestos for the purposes of the 
import prohibition has been better aligned with Australia’s domestic work, health and safety legislation. 

The importation of asbestos, and goods containing asbestos, is controlled under Regulation 4C of the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (PI Regulations). 

For further information on the changes to the asbestos border control please consult the updated legislation, 
including the explanatory statement located at: www.legislation.gov.au. 

New definition of asbestos 

The definition of asbestos under the PI Regulations is amended to align with the definition of asbestos under the 
Work, Health and Safety Regulations 2011 (Cth). That is, asbestos means the asbestiform varieties of mineral 
silicates belonging to the following serpentine or amphibole groups of rock forming minerals: 

  actinolite asbestos; 

  grunerite (or amosite) asbestos (brown); 

  anthophyllite asbestos; 

 

 

 

chrysotile asbestos (white); 

crocidolite asbestos (blue); 

tremolite asbestos; or 

  a mixture that contains one or more of the minerals referred above. 

As a result, only asbestiform asbestos is controlled at the border. The border control for the importation of 
asbestos is now applied equally to all of the specified asbestos mineral silicate types. Previously, amphibole 
asbestos and chrysotile asbestos were treated differently at the border. 

Laboratory reports from testing undertaken overseas that list a mineral silicate of the same name as in the list 
above must demonstrate that the mineral identified is of a non-asbestiform variety.  

Amendments to the import prohibition 

The amendments have removed provisions which previously enabled the Safety, Rehabilitation and 
Compensation Commission, and the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority to issue 
exemptions to the asbestos import prohibition. 

The amendments have removed Item 8 of Schedule 12 of the PI Regulations – Gas masks that contain asbestos. 
Goods formerly listed under this item are now captured by regulation 4C. 

The amendments have removed the exception for the importation of chrysotile asbestos from the Australian 
Antarctic Territory (AAT). Returning asbestos from the AAT to Australia will now be part of the Ministerial 
permission scheme. 

The amendments have removed Schedule 3B of the PI Regulations – Permitted importation of chrysotile, and the 
associated provision.

No. 2019/13 

Tobacco prohibited import and permit arrangement 

The Australian Government has introduced measures to combat the illicit tobacco trade as part of the 
2018-19 Budget ‘Black Economy Package – combatting illicit tobacco’. The package includes a measure to 
prohibit the importation of tobacco without a permit. The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment 
(collecting Tobacco Duties) Regulations 2019 enabling this measure commences on 1 July 2019.  

The measure amends the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation 1956 (the Regulations) to include 
regulation 4DA that prohibits the importation of tobacco products (other than certain exempted tobacco 
products) into Australia without written permission.  

Under regulation 4DA, the following tobacco products are exempt from the new import prohibition: 

smokeless tobacco products intended for oral use specified in regulation 4U of the Regulations 
cigars  
tobacco products imported by travellers within duty free limits 

• 
• 
• 
•  unmanufactured tobacco specified in regulation 4D of the Regulations. 

Permits will be issued by the Department of Home Affairs (Home Affairs). To obtain a permit, importers are 
required to lodge a written application with supporting documentation to Home Affairs. Permits will be subject 
to conditions or requirements that must be complied with by the permit holder. Breaches of permit conditions 
or requirements may result in the revocation of the permit.

No. 2019/14

Refunds for duty paid tobacco sold to duty free operators 

From 1 July 2019, all duties and taxes on tobacco products will be payable upon importation and the option 
to enter tobacco products into a licensed warehouse will cease.  

To ensure duty free operators can continue to replenish tobacco stocks and offer the sale of tobacco 
products at a duty free price after 1 July 2019, amendments to the Customs Regulation 2015 have been 
made. 

Please read this notice in conjunction with Notice No. 2018/35. 

New refund circumstance 

Duty free stores, catering bonds that supply aircraft stores, and providores that supply ship stores are 
Iicensed warehouses administered by the Department of Home Affairs (Home Affairs). From 1 July 2019, 
these businesses will no longer be able to complete a Warehouse Declaration (N20) to store tobacco 
products or obtain duty unpaid tobacco products underbond.  

To retain the ability for licensed duty free stores, catering bonds and providore warehouses to sell tobacco 
products at a duty free price to customers entitled to duty free purchases, amendments have been made to 
introduce two new refund circumstances at Items 20 and 21 of Schedule 6 of the Customs Regulation 2015. 
The new refund circumstances enable the original importer of tobacco products to apply for a refund of the 
duty paid on tobacco products that are sold to the proprietor of a licensed duty free store, catering bond or 
providore warehouse. The time limit for obtaining a refund under this circumstance is four years from the 
date the duty was paid. 

Those entitled to duty free purchases may include relevant travellers, operators of a ship or aircraft for use 
as a ship or aircraft store, or military and diplomatic officials with access to duty free entitlements. Duty 
refunded tobacco must be stored securely until sale to these customers. Forms and processes involved in 
these sales remain unchanged. 

Tobacco importers eligible for refunds under the new circumstance should quote Refund Reason Code 2021 
for either Items 20 or 21 when lodging a refund application in the Integrated Cargo System (ICS).  

Transitional arrangements for duty free operators 

Importers with tobacco held in excise-equivalent goods licensed warehouses on 1 July 2019 will be required 
to enter them into home consumption and pay the outstanding duties within 7 days from 1 July 2019. 
Importers unable to pay duty for existing underbond stock by that time, may be eligible to enter transitional 
arrangements to pay the outstanding amounts in instalments over 12 months. 

There is no requirement for duty free stores, providores and flight catering bond warehouses to enter duty 
unpaid tobacco products into home consumption on 1 July 2019. These businesses may hold current stocks 
of duty free tobacco until 1 January 2020, to allow time to reduce duty free stock through sales to customers 
entitled to duty free purchases.

Department of Home Affairs

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS 
NOTICE No.2019/16

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 2019-2020 

The Department of Home Affairs (the Department) will shortly contact Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme 
holders to discuss quota allocations for 2019-2020. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the importer’s usage of quota, as shown 
in the Department’s records of Import Declarations, which were entered for home consumption between 
01  July 2017 and 31 May 2019. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, 
importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the 
financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd 
importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under 
Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, then the quota cannot be used.  Similarly, if preference 
circumstances or Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), as listed in the various schedules of the Customs Tariff 
Act 95 apply, then the quota is not available.  

Pursuant to subsections 71A(7) and (8) of the Customs Act 1901, the cheese or curd is ‘entered for home 
consumption’ on the latter of the following two dates: 

(a) 
(b) 

the date of original lodgment; Or 
the date of the arrival of the vessel or aircraft at the first Australian port or airport at which any cargo 
is intended to be discharged. 

Please note that: 

• 

• 

• 

The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer during the 23-
month period or that remains unused at 31 May 2019 
For the 2020-21 allocation period, the allocation will be calculated by the sum of:  

a)  all quota entered for home consumption in 2018-19, and 
b)  all quota entered for home consumption between 01 July 2019 and 31 May 2020 

Note. Goods entered for home consumption between 01 June and 30 June 2020 will be included in the 
2021-2022 allocation 

Quota allocated in a particular financial year cannot be used to amend declarations entered for home 
consumption during a previous financial year 

At this time of the year, quota holders should take stock of quota balances with a view to optimising usage 
and consequently maximising their next allocation. 

The Department of Home Affairs will publish the final allocation in the Commonwealth of Australia: Tariff 
Concessions Gazette in July 2019.

No. 2019/19 

Implications of Comptroller General of Customs v. Zappia [2018] 
HCA 54 

The High Court of Australia handed down its decision in the case of Comptroller General of Customs 
v. Zappia [2018] HCA 54 on 14 November 2018. The full judgement is available at 
http://eresources.hcourt.gov.au/downloadPdf/2018/HCA/54.  

This Notice complements the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) Decision Impact Statement (S91/2018) 
of 17 January 2019, available at  
https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?DocID=LIT/ICD/S91-2018.  

Issues Decided by the Court 

The High Court considered the scope of subsection 35A(1) of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act), 
regarding the failure to keep dutiable goods safely. 

Subsection 35A(1) provides that where a person has, or has been entrusted with, the possession, custody or 
control of dutiable goods which are subject to customs control and the person fails to keep those goods 
safely or does not account to the Collector for those goods, the person shall pay an amount equal to the 
amount of customs duty that would have been payable on those goods. 

In Comptroller General of Customs v. Zappia, the High Court considered whether an employee of the holder 
of a warehouse licence could meet the description of ‘a person who has, or has been entrusted with, the 
possession, custody or control of dutiable goods which are subject to customs control’. 

The High Court unanimously held that section 35A is concerned with persons who have the de facto ability to 
keep goods safely and to prevent goods passing into home consumption without the payment of duty. The 
Court in this case found the employee had possession, custody or control of the goods before the goods 
were stolen from the warehouse and had failed to keep those goods safely. 

The decision affirmed that the statutory purpose of section 35A is to motivate persons who have the ability to 
keep dutiable goods safely, or to account to the Collector for the goods, to do so. 

In construing section 35A, the majority of the High Court held that the terms ‘possession’, ‘custody’ or 
‘control’ refer to holding a degree of power or authority in relation to dutiable goods, sufficient to enable a 
person to meet the obligations to keep the goods safely or account for the goods to the satisfaction of a 
Collector. Importantly, such power or authority need not be exclusive or paramount and may be subordinate 
to another person or authority. 

A person may therefore be subject to section 35A even if their possession, custody or control of goods is 
subject to the direction of another person.

(the Department). 

ACN 2008/33 is hereby cancelled with effect from the date of publication of this HAN. 

Tariff Advice Applications 

As advised previously in ACN 2008/33, the National Trade Advice Centre (NTAC) of the Department will 
screen all Tariff advice applications to ensure that supporting evidence is supplied.   

All Tariff Advice applications are expected to meet a minimum standard of supplied information.  Details of 
the information required are provided at the Department’s website (https://www.abf.gov.au/importing-
exporting-and-manufacturing/tariff-classification) under “Tariff Advice System”. The information requirements 
for Tariff Advice applications may be summarised as follows: 

• 

• 

• 

detailed identification and description of the goods to be imported; 

detailed reasons for the claimed heading and subheading (as well as for the tariff headings 
considered and rejected); and 

Illustrative Descriptive Material (IDM), other supporting evidence and/or sample (as 
appropriate) to be provided to the Department when lodging a manual application or within five 
days of entering the electronic Tariff Advice application. 

NTAC will not process a Tariff Advice application that does not include clear and legible IDM, other 
supporting evidence and/or a sample as required. 

Where a Tariff Advice application is accepted but further information is requested by NTAC, applicants will 
have 14 days to respond with the requested material.  Failure to respond within this period will result in 
rejection of the application.  NTAC will consider an extension of the 14 day period on a case-by-case basis, 
where the applicant shows that more time is needed to provide the information. 

Tariff Concession Order (TCO) Applications 

When considering a TCO application, delegates of the Comptroller-General of Customs (Comptroller-
General) require detailed information about the goods the subject of the TCO application as well as improved 
compliance with the level of detail required by the approved form.  Further details of the improved 
compliance are detailed in HAN 2019/21 Applicant’s obligations when applying for a Tariff Concession Order 
(TCO). 

The Department acknowledges that the date of operative effect is important in TCO applications, but this 
does not remove the requirement for valid and complete applications.  As clarified following consultation with

Applicant’s obligations when applying for a Tariff Concession 
Order (TCO) 

This Home Affairs Notice (notice) updates the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) 
Australian Customs Notice (ACN) No. 2010/03 to reflect changes brought about by the establishment of the 
Department of Home Affairs (the Department) and its operational arm, the Australian Border Force (ABF). 

ACN 2010/03 is hereby cancelled with effect from the date of publication of this notice. 

The application form (Form B443) for Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs) is an Approved Form as required by 
s.269F(2)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) and is available on the ABF’s website at 
www.abf.gov.au.  The Approved Form must be used to apply for a TCO. 

This notice provides advice to applicants for TCOs on how to complete the form when making an application. 

The application form 

The form reinforces obligations for TCO applicants to provide evidence that satisfies the Comptroller-General 
of Customs (Comptroller-General) (previously the Chief Executive Officer of Customs) that there are 
reasonable grounds for asserting that the application meets the core criteria as defined at s.269C of the 
Customs Act.  Specifically, the legislation requires provision of all information that an applicant has, or can 
reasonably be expected to have, and all inquiries that an applicant has made or can reasonably be expected 
to make to determine whether Australian manufacturers of substitutable goods exist (s.269FA of the 
Customs Act). 

An application meets the core criteria if, on the day of lodgement of the application, no substitutable goods 
were produced in Australia in the ordinary course of business. 

The legislation and relevant policy guidelines require that delegates of the Comptroller-General be rigorous 
in ensuring applicants meet their obligations when lodging an application.  Where a TCO applicant provides 
less than reasonable information or has not conducted reasonable and appropriate inquiries to determine 
whether Australian manufacturers of substitutable goods exist, delegates of the Comptroller-General may 
reject those applications. 

It is not the intent of the Tariff Concession System that an applicant should apply for a concession in the 
hope that a potential producer of substitutable goods will not object. 

Form B443 was amended in 2010 to reflect the requirement for more specific responses from applicants.  
The latest version of the form is available from the Tariff Concession System pages on the ABF website –

No. 2019/23 

Origin Waiver benefit for Australian Trusted Traders 

As of 28 June 2019, Australian Trusted Trader importers will no longer be required to obtain or present origin 
certification documents, such as a Certificate of Origin (CoO) or Declaration of Origin (DoO), in order to claim 
preferential rates of duty under certain free trade agreements (FTAs).  

This provision applies for the: 

  Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement (Division 1F of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901) 

 

Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement (Division 1K of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901) 

  Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement (Division 1J of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901) 

  Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement (Division 1H of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901) 

  Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (Division 1B and 1BA Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901) 

  Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement (Division 1D of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901).  

Trusted Trader importers will still be required to keep evidence (generally for a period of at least five years 
from the day of importation) that imported goods comply with the relevant rules of origin and present this if 
asked. Examples of evidence can include commercial documentation and contracts, and statements in 
relation to manufacturing process, materials and compliance with cost requirements from manufacturers.   

The evidence will need to be sufficient to prove that the goods meet the relevant Division of the 
Customs Act 1901 and Customs Regulations pertaining to rules of origin (for the relevant FTA) in the 
absence of a CoO or DoO. If available under the provisions of the relevant FTA, Trusted Trader importers 
may be able to meet a request for evidence of origin by providing ‘retrospective’ origin documentation 
(eg. a ‘retrospective’ CoO or DoO).   

Where a Trusted Trader importer has paid duty on goods that were later understood to be originating goods 
under an eligible FTA, they are able to apply for a refund of overpaid duties. An application for a refund must 
include documentary evidence of origin, such as the commercial documentation, manufacture statements or 
a CoO or DoO. The Origin Waiver benefit does not apply to refund applications for goods imported prior to 
28 June 2019.  

This waiver does not apply to exports made by Trusted Traders to parties to these FTAs.

subheadings 2203.00.6 and 2206.00.7 in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff Act). 

The revised classifications are reflected in Schedules 4A, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8A, 8B, 9, 10, 11 and 12 to the Customs 
Tariff Act. The revisions in Schedule 8A, which applies to Pacific Island originating goods will take effect on the 
date that this Schedule commences.  

A concordance of these changes is available at Attachment A and revised Tariff Working Pages at 
Attachment B. The Online Tariff will be amended to reflect these changes on 1 July 2019.

Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent 
goods on 5 August 2019 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, beers 
and fuel products, operative from 5 August 2019.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act), provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is 
calculated by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June 
or December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. 

On 31 July 2019, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June 2019 Quarter figure (114.8). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for August 2019 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number

December Quarter

Indexation Factor

114.1 

1.006 

As the indexation factor for August 2019 (1.006) is greater than one, customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff, will be increased by the application of this factor.  

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 5 August 2019, are set out in Table 1 
and supersede the rates outlined in Department of Home Affairs Notice 2019/03.

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations  
for 2019-2020 

The Australian Border Force (ABF) has determined the 2019-20 allocations under the Cheese and Curd 
Quota Scheme, which it administers on behalf of the Department of Agriculture. The allocation was gazetted 
on 03 July 2019 in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette - Tariff Concessions No. 2019/25. 

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 23-month 
period ending 31 May 2019, as shown in departmental records of clearances entered for home consumption.  
This calculation excludes any part of the quota that was transferred to another importer during the 23-month 
period or that was unused as at 31 May 2019. 

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, importers 
are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the financial year 
to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of 
Australian origin (returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the 
Customs Tariff Act 1995; preference circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) exist, quota is 
unable to be used. 

The cheese or curd is considered to be ‘entered for home consumption’ if: 

(a) 

an import declaration, which identifies item 55, for the goods is lodged with the ABF, and 

(b) 
airport for the discharge of cargo. 

the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port or 

Quota allocations are transferable between importers.  A person may apply to transfer quota entitlements by 
completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) available at

Weapons – Amendments to the  
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 

From 10 August 2019 the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment (Weapons) Regulations 2019 amended 
the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the Regulations) for the lawful importation of weapons 
(non-firearms). 

The amendments ensure that the community remains protected from new and emerging weapons 
technologies, and improves the administrative efficiency of the Regulations. 

Strict procedures remain in place to ensure that only those with a lawful need to import weapons and 
associated parts into Australia are able to do so provided they meet certain conditions and requirements. 
The penalties for importing prohibited weapons without a permit can include a fine of up to 2,500 penalty 
units (currently $525,000), imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both. 

Weapons are prohibited on entry to Australia unless permission has been granted in accordance with the 
requirements in Schedule 13 of the Regulations. Part 2 of Schedule 13 of the Regulations list prohibited 
weapons. 

Changes to weapons import requirements are: 

Police certification (B709B form) is now an accepted import test for maces, flails, body armour, extendable 
batons and their parts, and laser pointers.  

Flamethrowers and similar flame projector devices not specifically ‘designed or adapted for warfare or like 
purposes’ are now expressly prohibited under new Items 46 and 47. Permission is required from the 
Australian Border Force in order to import these goods to Australia. Military and warfare type flamethrowers 
are still controlled under Item 1.  

Karambits, handheld curved knives that resemble a claw, are now expressly prohibited under new Item 28A. 
Permission to import is required from the Australian Border Force to import karambits and similar devices 
into Australia. 

Powders, gels and other substances designed to incapacitate or kill are now prohibited import under Item 1 
in the same way as gases and liquids. 

Sling shots with a tensioning, locking or triggering device are now prohibited under Item 21. Previously only 
hunting slings, catapults or sling shots with an arm brace were prohibited imports. 

An update has occurred to some definitions of weapons in Schedule 13 to include ‘or similar devices’ to 
weapons specified in Schedule 13.

No. 2019/32 
Biannual indexation of customs duty rates for tobacco 
and tobacco products – 1 September 2019 

This notice sets out the new excise-equivalent customs duty rates on tobacco and tobacco products, 
operative from 1 September 2019. 

Indexation provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate 

Sections 19AB and 19AC of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides for biannual 
indexation, in March and September, of the excise-equivalent customs duty rates applied to tobacco products 
where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis. In September, the rates are indexed by 
the average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) indexation factor and then an additional 12.5 per cent 
indexation factor. The additional indexation factor will apply to each September indexation until 2020. 

Adjustments for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ rate 

Section 19ACA of the Customs Tariff Act provides for biannual adjustments of the excise-equivalent customs 
duty rates applied tobacco products where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per kilogram’ or a 
‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ basis. The new rate is determined by dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ rate by 
the weight conversion factor which applies for a 12 month period commencing on 1 September. The new 
rate commences at the same time as the indexed ‘per stick’ rate. 

Calculation of excise-equivalent customs duty rates operative from 1 September 2019 

On 15 August 2019, the Australia Bureau of Statistics released the AWOTE figure for the June Quarter 2019 
(1634.8). The AWOTE Indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most recent AWOTE figure by the 
highest AWOTE figure for a previous June or December quarter that does not precede the 
2012 December Quarter. 

The AWOTE indexation factor is only applied when it is greater than 1. The 12.5 per cent additional 
indexation factor is applied to all September indexation.

No. 2019/36 
Luxury Car Tax (LCT) on re-imported, refurbished 
vehicles 

Non-taxable re-importations of refurbished luxury cars 

The A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 has been amended to remove liability for luxury car tax 
on cars that are exported and then re-imported following service, repair or refurbishment overseas. 

An importation of a car is a non-taxable re-importation if: 

(a)  The car was exported from the indirect tax zone1 and is returned to the indirect tax zone; and 

(b)  The car has been subject to any treatment, industrial processing, repair, renovation, alteration or any 

other process since its export; and 

(c)  The ownership of the car has not changed in the period beginning immediately before the car was 

exported and ending at the time it is returned to the indirect tax zone. 

Importers should enter the exemption code ‘L720’ when completing their N10 import declaration for the 
affected vehicle. 

Application - the amendment applies in relation to re-importations occurring on or after 1 January 2019 and 
will be applied retrospectively. 

For those that have paid LCT on an affected vehicle between 1 January 2019 and 1 October 2019, 
information on how to obtain a refund will be communicated through a separate Australian Customs Notice in 
the near future. 

For further information on the change, visit the Australian Taxation Office website at

Amendments to Schedule 4 of the  
Customs Tariff Act 1995 Item 1 by-law and 
Clarification of Origin Preference Codes for the 
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for 
Trans-Pacific Partnership   

Schedule 4 Item 1 – Revocation and replacement of by-law 1800146  

Item 1 of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 provides a “free” rate of duty for goods prescribed by 
by-law that are: 

•  Scientific instruments or apparatus to which Annex D of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Materials Agreement (Florence 1950) or Annex D to the Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Materials Protocol (Nairobi 1976) applies; or 

•  Of a scientific nature and covered by an agreement or arrangement between the Government of 
Australia and the government of another country or other countries on cooperation in the field of 
science and technology. 

Prescribed by-law 1800146 will be revoked and reissued as by-law 1919366 (Attachment A).  By-law 
1919366 updates Paragraph 2, Table A, with the inclusion of the Children’s Cancer Institute to the list of 
organisations authorised to use the by-law. 

In addition, the titles of the Ministers able to approve use of the by-law by scientific or educational institutions 
not previously covered in the by-law have been updated to reflect changes to these titles since the last 
update of this by-law.   

Clarification of Origin Preference Codes for the Comprehensive and Progressive 
Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership   

From 13 November 2019, Importers will be able to use the Preference Rule PE (Produced Entirely) when 
entering suitable goods eligible for a preference under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for 
the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), into the Integrated Cargo System (ICS).  The existing and equivalent 
Preference Rule WP (Wholly Produced) will be retained in ICS for a period of 6 months ending on 13 May 
2020.   

Replacing WP with PE in ICS resolves the discrepancy between the CPTPP information provided on the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) website and information provided on the Australian Border 
Force website.

No. 2019/40
Changes to import licence requirements for equipment 
containing hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)
refrigerant

From 1 January 2020, the hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) equipment low volume import exemption will 
cease. However, the low volume import conditions for synthetic greenhouse gas (SGG) equipment are not 
changing.

The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 (OPSGGM Act) prohibits the 
import and export of equipment containing SGG and ozone depleting substances (ODS) including HCFCs,
unless the importer holds a valid equipment licence issued by the Department of the Environment and 
Energy (DoEE) or qualifies for a licence exemption. 

A list of controlled SGG and ODS can be found in Schedule 1 of the OPSGGM Act, Schedule 10 of the 
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and Schedule 15 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) 
Regulations 1958.

Ban on the import of all HCFC equipment unless an exemption applies

From 1 January 2020 it will be illegal to import any type of HCFC equipment, unless an exemption applies or 
a licence is issued by the DoEE. This includes, for example, refrigerators, air conditioners, fire extinguishers 
and aerosols, and all other equipment that uses HCFCs, even if it does not have gas in it at the time of 
import.

HCFC equipment – low volume import licence exemption

From 1 January 2020, the HCFC equipment low volume import licence exemption will cease. 

The HCFC low volume import licence exemption for equipment will remain available until 
31 December 2019. Further information can be found at: 

http://environment.gov.au/protection/ozone/licences-and-reporting/hcfc-ban

HCFC equipment – personal and household goods import licence exemption

Importers are able to import HCFC equipment without holding a licence if they meet the requirements for the 
personal and household goods exemption: Importers must have owned the equipment for 12 months before 
the import, and it is wholly or principally for private or domestic use.

2019-11-29,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2019-41.pdf,Evidentiary Requirements for Duty Drawback Claims,"Australian Customs Notice  
No. 2019/41 
Evidentiary Requirements for Duty Drawback Claims 

This Notice replaces the Australian Customs Notice (ACN) No.2002/51 to clarify requirements for duty 
drawback claims, including claims made using the Imputation Method (also known as Method C).  

Pursuant to section 168 of the Customs Act 1901 and regulations 34, 35, 36 and 37 of the Customs 
(International Obligations) Regulation 2015, the Australian Border Force (ABF) will only approve a duty 
drawback claim if it is satisfied that the relevant goods were imported, import duty was paid and not 
refunded, and records are available showing that duty has been paid.  

The ABF administers the duty drawback scheme based on self-assessment. A drawback claimant should 
self-assess their entitlement to duty drawbacks in accordance with the regulations before lodging a claim. 
The ABF expects drawback claimants to provide, upon request, sufficient evidence to substantiate a 
drawback claim, including evidence establishing that duty was paid on the imported goods. This applies to all 
drawback claims lodged using any calculation method.   

Drawback claims using Method C 

An exporter may use Method C to calculate the amount of duty drawback payable, if the exporter was not the 
importer of the relevant goods and as a result does not know the amount of import duty paid. However, the 
calculation method for the amount does not negate other prescribed requirements for a valid drawback 
claim, including that: 

1.  Drawback of duty is only payable on the export of goods for which import duty has been 

paid; 

2.  All the conditions prescribed by regulation 37 must be met, including that records are 

available at all reasonable times for examination by an officer to show that import duty has 
been paid on the goods; and 

3.  Drawback of duty is not payable if the free on board price of the goods at the time of 

exportation is less than 25% of the customs value of the goods determined at the time of 
importation, or if the import duty has been refunded.   

Usage of Method C will therefore usually be restricted to fully imported goods purchased in Australia by the 
exporter from the original importer. Before lodging a drawback claim in these circumstances using Method C, 
the claimant should obtain from their Australian supplier written confirmation that the supplier imported the 
relevant goods and paid the import duty, which was not refunded.  

It may help the drawback claim if the claimant could arrange for their supplier to provide import documents 
for the relevant goods directly to the ABF when requested. That may satisfy the requirement that records are 
available showing that import duty was paid, while maintaining the confidentiality of commercially sensitive 
information.

No. 2019/43 
Kava and Prohibited Substances changes to the 
Prohibited Exports and Imports Regulations 

On 17 December 2019 the Customs (Prohibited Imports) (Kava) Approval 2019 (the Approval), and the 
Customs Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Exports and Imports) Regulations 2019 (the Amendment) will 
come into effect. 

The Approval – Kava – Personal Importation Pilot 

The Approval eases the restrictions on the importation of kava by increasing the quantity of kava that may be 
imported for personal use from 2 kilograms to 4 kilograms. 

From 17 December 2019 the Approval enables the personal importation into Australia of kava that is in root 
or dried form, or in the form of a beverage obtained by aqueous suspension of kava root in cold water only, 
by passengers aged over 18 years who have arrived in Australia by ship or aircraft and have imported the 
kava in their accompanied personal effects.  

The Amendment – Prohibited Substances 

Australia is a signatory to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs for the Single Convention on 
Narcotic Drugs of 1961, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 
1971 and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic 
Substances 1988 (the Narcotic Conventions).   

The amendments set out in the table below will ensure Australia’s continuing compliance with the Narcotic 
Conventions by adding the newly scheduled substances to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 
1958 (the Prohibited Exports Regulations) and the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the 
Prohibited Imports Regulations). This will minimise diversion and misuse of these substances.

Changes to Biosecurity Cost Recovery 

From 1 January 2020 there will be an increase to the biosecurity cost recovery charge collected on 
imported goods with a customs value over AUD1000.  

The Australian Government is expanding the types of biosecurity activities to be cost recovered. 
These include biosecurity assurance, analytics and risk mitigation activities administered by the 
Department of Agriculture (Agriculture). The changes are necessary to manage the risk of pest and disease 
incursions posed by goods and vessels entering Australia. They will address increased passenger and mail 
volumes, rising costs and an expected doubling of cargo volumes by 2030. 

The Australian Border Force collects the biosecurity cost recovery charge through the Integrated 
Cargo System (ICS), on behalf of Agriculture. The new charge rates, reflected in the table below, will 
automatically apply to imports from 1 January 2020.

No. 2019/45 
Home Affairs Type 3 Digital Certificate Replacement 
The Department of Home Affairs’ existing Type 3 digital certificate will expire in late January 2020, 
so Home Affairs will be ‘rolling over’ to a newly issued certificate on Wednesday 15 January 2020. 

This means that users who send messages to the Integrated Cargo System (in both Industry Test 
and Production), using electronic data interchange (EDI) software will need to rollover to the new 
Home Affairs digital certificate. 

This rollover does not affect any digital certificates you or your organisation may have purchased. 

Who does the rollover affect? 

If you, your company, or your clients are communicating with Home Affairs using any type 
of EDI package, it will be necessary to install the new Home Affairs certificate into your EDI 
Application. Please note that Home Affairs does not provide technical support for 3rd Party 
Software packages. 

The rollover does not affect organisations who only use Cargo Interactive (CI), or who use the 
services of a bureau. 

What should I do? 

A copy of the new Home Affairs Type 3 certificate can be downloaded from this page: 
https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support/ics/integrated-cargo-system-(ics)/using-the-
ics/digital-certificates. 

The Department will rollover to the new certificate during the 00:00-04:00 outage window 
on Wednesday 15 January 2020. 

Clients must continue to use the existing Home Affairs certificate for all EDI message 
transactions up until 23:59 on Tuesday 14 January, and then use the new Home Affairs 
certificate for all EDI message transactions from Wednesday 15 January onwards. 

All messages sent by the Department after the rollover outage will be signed using the new 
Home Affairs certificate, so at that point if you have not yet changed your systems to use 
the new certificate your EDI software will fail to authenticate new messages and will reject 
them. 

All EDI messages that you send to the Department after the rollover must be encrypted using the 
new Home Affairs certificate or they may be rejected by the Department.

No. 2019/46 
The Special Recreational Vessels Act 2019 

The Special Recreational Vessels Act 2019 (SRV Act) is intended to allow ‘special recreational vessels’ 
(superyachts) to visit Australia for up to 12 months and conduct commercial activities without being regarded 
as imported under customs legislation. 

The SRV Act achieves this by establishing a condition for qualifying special recreational vessels to ‘opt in’ to 
the coastal trading licence scheme established by the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 
2012 (Coastal Trading Act).  The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and 
Communications administers both the SRV Act and the Coastal Trading Act. 

Any vessel that obtains a coastal trading licence through the new condition established by the SRV Act will 
be subject to the Australian Border Force’s (ABF) existing arrangements for vessels operating under coastal 
trading licences. 

Vessels that enter and operate in Australia in accordance with the SRV Act will be considered international 
commercial vessels rather than recreational vessels.  The SRV Act does not change existing reporting and 
permissions for international commercial vessels operating in Australian waters under the coastal trading 
licence scheme. 

Treatment of vessels operating under the SRV Act 

Vessels that obtain a coastal trading licence through the SRV Act must comply with the standard reporting 
and operating requirements for international commercial vessels under the Coastal Trading Act and customs 
legislation. 

Vessels covered by the SRV Act are required to: 
  Report to the ABF details of the arrival, including who and what is on board. 

o  All commercial vessels arriving into Australia must report their impending and actual arrivals to the 

ABF within the prescribed timeframes. 

  Report the impending and actual arrivals at all subsequent ports of call in Australia in accordance with 

the prescribed timeframes. 

  Obtain a Certificate of Clearance prior to departing a port. 
  Have permission (under section 58 of the Customs Act 1901) to visit any places other than an appointed 

section 15 port. 
o  Vessels covered by the SRV Act intending to arrive at or visit non-appointed ports must submit a 

request for permission through the Maritime Travellers Processing Committee (MTPC).


A request though the MTPC must be submitted no earlier than ten (10) business days prior than 
to the vessel intended arrival in Australia.

No. 2020/05 
Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent 
goods on 3 February 2020 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, beers 
and fuel products, operative from 3 February 2020.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act), provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is 
calculated by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June 
or December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. 

On 29 January 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December 2019 Quarter figure (116.2). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for February 2020 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 

December Quarter 2019 

June Quarter 2019 

Indexation Factor 

116.2 

114.8 

1.012 

As the indexation factor for February 2019 (1.012) is greater than one, customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff, will be increased by the application of this factor.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 3 February 2020, are set out in 
Table 1 and supersede the rates outlined in Australian Customs Notice 2019/29. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:  

•  Schedule 4A (Singaporean originating goods)  
•  Schedule 5 (US originating goods)  
•  Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods)  
•  Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods)

Rates of exchange and the day of exportation 

Invoice amounts to be in Australian Currency 

When goods imported into Australia are invoiced in a foreign currency, that invoice amount must be 
converted to Australian dollars using the prevailing rate of exchange for that particular currency on the day 
of exportation.  This requirement is set out in subsection 161J (1) of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act).  

 Subsection 161J (1)    

Where an amount that is, in accordance with this Division, required to be taken into account for 
the purpose of ascertaining a value of any imported goods is an amount in a currency other than 
Australian currency, the amount to be so taken into account shall be the equivalent in Australian 
currency of that amount, ascertained according to the ruling rate of exchange in relation to that 
other currency in respect of the day of exportation of the goods. 

Day of exportation  

The day of exportation in relation to imported goods is defined in subsection 161J (4) of the Customs Act.  

Subsection 161J (4) 

In this section: 
day of exportation, in relation to imported goods, means: 
(a) 

where the goods were exported by post from the place of export and a Collector is 
satisfied as to the day of posting—that day; 
where the goods departed or were transported from their place of export in any other way 
and a Collector is satisfied as to the day of their departure or transportation—that day; and 
In any other case—a day determined by the Collector. 

(b) 

(c) 

This definition provides that the day of exportation is the day the goods left the place of export; or if 
posted, the day the goods were posted. In both of these cases, the Collector must be satisfied as to the 
correctness of the dates. If the Collector is not satisfied, then the Collector must determine a day of export. 

Place of export 

 Subsection 154 (1) provides the definition of place of export for the purposes of determining the day of 
exportation as follows: 

""place of export"" , in relation to imported goods, means:  

a)  where, while in the country from which they were exported the goods were posted to 

Australia--the place where they were so posted;

No. 2020/10 
Biannual indexation of customs duty rates for tobacco 
and tobacco products – 1 March 2020 

This notice sets out the new excise-equivalent customs duty rates on tobacco and tobacco products, 
operative from 1 March 2020. 

Indexation provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate 

Sections 19AB and 19AC of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provide for biannual indexation, 
in March and September, of the excise-equivalent customs duty rates applied to tobacco products where the 
amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis. The rates are indexed by the average weekly 
ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) indexation factor based on data published by the Australian Bureau of 
Statistics. In September, the rates are also subject to an additional 12.5 per cent indexation factor. The 
additional indexation factor will apply to each September indexation until 2020. 

Adjustments for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ rate 

Section 19ACA of the Customs Tariff Act provides for biannual adjustments of the excise-equivalent customs 
duty rates applied tobacco products where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per kilogram’ or a 
‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ basis. The new rate is determined by dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ rate by 
the weight conversion factor which applies for a 12 month period commencing on 1 September. The new 
rate commences at the same time as the indexed ‘per stick’ rate. 

Calculation of excise-equivalent customs duty rates operative from 1 March 2020 

On 20 February 2020, the Australia Bureau of Statistics released the AWOTE figure for the December 
Quarter 2019 (1658.4). The AWOTE Indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most recent AWOTE 
figure by the highest AWOTE figure for a previous June or December quarter that does not precede the 
2012 December Quarter. 

The AWOTE indexation factor is only applied when it is greater than 1. The 12.5 per cent additional 
indexation factor is applied to all September indexations.

Firearms changes to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) 
Regulations 1956 

On 25 March 2020 the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment (Firearms) Regulations 2020 (the 
Amendments) will come into effect. The Amendments change conditions on the importation of certain 
firearms and certain firearms devices under Schedule 6 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 
1956 (the Regulations).  

The Amendments  

Firearm Accessory  

Bump stocks, auto gloves and similar devices that give a firearm the capability of being operated in a way 
that mimics fully automatic and/or burst fire operation are now defined as firearm accessories and are 
controlled on import. Firearm accessories can only be imported with a valid Department of Home Affairs 
(Department) permit and therefore must comply with at least one of the following tests:  

 
 
 

the official purposes test 
the specified purposes test, or  
the returned goods test.  

The requirement to meet one of these tests may also be met by compliance with either the public interest 
test or the national interest test. 

The Amendments are necessary to ensure that the community remains protected from these new and 
emerging technologies, for which there is no legitimate civilian use. 

Any person who intentionally imports a bump stock, auto glove or similar device without the appropriate 
permission may be liable for a penalty under subsection 233BAB(5) of the Customs Act 1901 
(the Customs Act) of imprisonment for 10 years or 2,500 penalty units (currently $525,000), or both. 

Category H articles  

The Amendments remove redundant conditions on the importation of Category H articles (handguns, and 
frames or receivers of, or for, handguns) by firearms dealers, reducing the regulatory burden associated with 
these importations. The Amendments for Category H articles have two key aspects:

Export control on goods essential to controlling and 
preventing the spread of COVID-19 

On 30 March 2020, the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Amendment (COVID-19 Human Biosecurity Emergency) 
Regulations 2020 (the Amendment) amended the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 
(the Regulations) to implement a temporary prohibition on the non-commercial export of certain goods that 
contribute to controlling and preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Exemptions to this prohibition are 
detailed below.   

The Amendment 

The Amendment limits the means by which goods essential to preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus can 
be exported from Australia. The Amendment is part of the Government’s measures to restrict hoarding, 
profiteering and non-commercial exporting of certain products that are essential to combating the current 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Amendment prohibits the export of the following goods for the period that the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity 
Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020 is in force: 

  personal protective equipment in the form of disposable face masks, disposable gloves, disposable 

gowns, protective eye wear in the form of goggles, glasses or visors, which can be worn by 
individuals to limit the transmission of organisms; and 

  alcohol wipes and hand sanitizer. 

The Minister for Home Affairs is also able to determine additional goods that are subject to the export prohibition.  

The Amendment prohibits the export of these goods by post absolutely. It remains possible to export these goods 
by other means, such as courier services or cargo, in any of the circumstances exempt from the export prohibition 
as described below. 

The export prohibition does not apply when the goods are exported in the following circumstances:  

 

for personal use by a passenger or crew member in their accompanied personal or household 
effects; 

  by a person to a relative of the person, for the relative’s personal use; 
  by a humanitarian organisation for non-commercial purposes;  
  by an Australian manufacturer of the goods; or 
  by a person who exported those types of goods in the course of their ordinary business, and is 
registered for Australian Goods and Services Tax and has an Australian Business Number.

and incomplete tablet presses unless permission has been granted. This amendment removes 
uncertainty about the goods to which this import control applies. 

The new definitions for tablet presses and encapsulators 

Subregulation 4G(7) of the Regulations now defines: 

Tablet press: Any equipment which can be used for the compaction or moulding of 
powdered or granular solids, or semi-solid material to produce coherent solid tablets, 
whether or not complete, temporarily or permanently inoperable, or unfinished. 

Encapsulators: Any equipment which can be used for the complete envelopment of 
powdered or granular solids, semi-solid material, liquids, or gases to produce coherent solid 
capsules, whether or not complete, temporarily or permanently inoperable, or unfinished.  

Permits cannot be issued before 1 May 2020 

Importers may have ordered goods prior to this announcement, and can lodge an application prior 
to 1 May 2020 for permission to import those goods. However, the Australian Border Force is 
unable to grant permission to import any goods captured by the amended prohibition before the 
legislation commences. Importers whose goods arrive before a decision is made on their 
application for permission to import will be responsible for any storage costs they may incur.  

Further information 

For information regarding these changes, please consult the relevant legislation, including the 
explanatory statement, at https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F1996B03651.

Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 
2020-2021 

The Australian Border Force will shortly contact Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme holders to discuss quota 
allocations for 2020-2021. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the importer’s usage of quota, as shown 
in the Department’s records of Import Declarations, which were entered for home consumption between 
01  July 2018 and 31 May 2020. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, 
importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the 
financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd 
importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under 
Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, then the quota cannot be used.  Similarly, if preference 
circumstances or Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), as listed in the various schedules of the Customs Tariff 
Act 95 apply, then the quota is not available.  

Pursuant to subsections 71A(7) and (8) of the Customs Act 1901, the cheese or curd is ‘entered for home 
consumption’ on the latter of the following two dates: 

(a) 
(b) 

the date of original lodgment; Or 
the date of the arrival of the vessel or aircraft at the first Australian port or airport at which any cargo 
is intended to be discharged. 

Please note that: 
 

The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer during the 23-
month period or that remains unused at 31 May 2020 
For the 2021-22 allocation period, the allocation will be calculated by the sum of:  

a)  all quota entered for home consumption in 2019-20, and 
b)  all quota entered for home consumption between 01 July 2020 and 31 May 2021 

Note. Goods entered for home consumption between 01 June and 30 June 2021 will be included in the 
2022-2023 allocation 

Quota allocated in a particular financial year cannot be used to amend declarations entered for home 
consumption during a previous financial year 

 

 

At this time of the year, quota holders should take stock of quota balances with a view to optimising usage 
and consequently maximising their next allocation.

Extension of Origin Waiver benefit for Australian 
Trusted Traders 

The Origin Waiver benefit (ACN no. 2019/23) for Australian Trusted Trader (ATT) importers is extended to 
goods manufactured in and imported from Pacific Forum Countries, Lesser Developed Countries (LDC) and 
Developing Countries (DC).  

The Origin Waiver expansion benefit means ATT Importers are no longer required to obtain or present origin 
certification documents, such as a Certificate of Origin (CoO) or the declaration on a commercial invoice, in 
order to claim preferential rates of duty for countries listed in Schedule 1 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995.  

The provision applies to: 

  Pacific Forum Island Countries as listed in Part 1 of Schedule 1; 
  Lesser Developed Countries (LDC) as listed in Part 2 of Schedule 1; 
  Developing Countries subject to the DC rates of duty as listed in Part 3 of Schedule 1; 
  Developing Countries subject to the DCS rates of duty as listed in Part 4 of Schedule 1; and 
  Developing Countries subject to the DCT rates of duty as listed in Part 5 of Schedule 1. 

Trusted Trader importers are still required to keep evidence (generally for a period of at least five years from 
the day of importation) that imported goods comply with the relevant rules of origin and present this evidence 
if asked. Examples of evidence can include: proof the last place of manufacture was in the LDC or DC; proof 
at least 50 per cent of the total factory cost occurred in a LDC or DC; commercial documentation and 
contracts; statements in relation to manufacturing process; and materials and compliance with cost 
requirements from manufacturers.  

The evidence will need to prove that the goods meet the relevant Division of the Customs Act 1901 and 
Customs Regulations pertaining to rules of origin (for the relevant LDC or DC) in the absence of a CoO or 
declaration on a commercial invoice.  

Where a Trusted Trader importer has paid duty on goods that were later understood to be originating goods 
under an eligible LDC or DC, they are able to apply for a refund of overpaid duties. An application for a 
refund must include documentary evidence of origin, such as the commercial documentation, manufacture 
statements or a CoO. The Origin Waiver benefit does not apply to refund applications for goods imported 
from Pacific Island Forum Countries, LDC or DC prior to 27 November 2019.

No. 2020/22 
New Australian Trusted Trader (ATT) Benefit 

ATT Consolidated Cargo Reporting Benefit 

Consolidated cargo reporting commences for Trusted Traders 

From 30 June 2020, new arrangements for the reporting of consolidated shipments commence for Australian 
Trusted Trader (ATT) importers. This benefit permits ATT cargo reporters to lodge a single cargo report for 
consignments from multiple suppliers, consolidated overseas and shipped to a single Trusted Trader 
importer. 

This will reduce and simplify the cargo reporting for ATT cargo reporters and ATT importers. 

Changes to cargo report for consolidated shipments to Trusted Traders 

The Consolidated Cargo Reporting benefit will allow a single cargo report for consolidated shipments to ATT 
importers for all sea and air cargo types. 

Rather than submitting a cargo report for each supplier in a consolidated shipment, the Trusted Trader cargo 
reporter would provide one cargo report with the freight forwarder/consolidator listed in lieu of the consignor. 
Supplier information ordinarily provided on cargo reports will continue to be provided via the associated 
import declaration. 

To use the Consolidated Cargo Reporting (CCR) benefit the following requirements must be met: 

  The cargo reporter/freight forwarder is a Trusted Trader; 

  The importer is a Trusted Trader; 

  The supplier details are listed in the full import declaration (FID); and 

  The FID is lodged at least 48 hours prior to arrival at first port for sea cargo and 2 hours prior to 

arrival for air cargo. 

In circumstances where the cargo reporter and the broker are not the same entity, then the cargo reporter 
must ensure that the broker is aware of the requirement to lodge the FID at least 48 hours prior to first port of 
arrival for sea cargo or two hours prior to arrival for air cargo. 

Importers that are not Trusted Traders 

The process for importers not accredited under ATT will not change. A cargo report and import declaration is 
required for each consignor (supplier) in a consolidated shipment. ACN 2009/47 clarifies the standard 
reporting requirements for cargo arriving in Australia from a place outside Australia. In particular, the 
information required for advising consignee and consignor details on a cargo report submitted for the 
purposes of section 64AB of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act).

Chemical Weapons – Amendments to the                   

Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 

From 7 June 2020, Part 2 of Schedule 11 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 
(the Regulations) has been amended to prohibit from import four new toxic chemicals that can be 
used as chemical warfare agents. The chemicals are known as ‘Novichok’ nerve agents. 

‘Novichok’ nerve agents 

In November 2019, the ‘Novichok’ nerve agents were added to the Convention on the Prohibition 
of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their 
Destruction (the CWC).  In accordance with Australia’s obligations under the CWC, listed 
chemicals are prohibited from import into Australia by Regulation 5J.  This amendment aligns the 
Regulations and the CWC. 

The prohibited ‘Novichok’ nerve agents are described by chemical compound or group of 
compounds, and the CAS number in Part 2 of Schedule 11 of the Regulations. Please consult the 
relevant legislation for details, at https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L00637. 

Permission to import 

The import of chemicals listed in Part 2 of Schedule 11 of the Regulations from countries not party 
to the Convention is prohibited absolutely. Import from a country that is a party to the Convention is 
prohibited unless the Minister for Foreign Affairs or an authorised person has given permission.  

For further information, please consult the Australian Safeguards and Non-proliferation Office

No. 2020/29 
Amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) 
Regulations 1958 – Schedule 2 Rotterdam 
Convention Chemicals 

Phorate added to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 

With effect from 11 July 2020, phorate (an insecticide chemical) has been added to the list of prohibited 
chemicals in Schedule 2 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (the PE Regulations). 

Under Regulation 4A of the PE Regulations, chemicals listed in Schedule 2 are prohibited exports from 
Australia, unless permission has been granted by the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency 
Management or an authorised officer from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment 
(DAWE), under the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Regulations 1995 (the AVCA 
Regulations). 

This amendment gives effect in Australian law to the listing of phorate in an amendment to Annex III of the 
Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and 
Pesticides in International Trade (the Convention). The Convention governs banned or severely restricted 
chemicals and severely hazardous pesticides. 

Australia ratified the Convention on 20 May 2004. This amendment is a minor treaty action which was 
endorsed by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on 2 December 2019. 

Australia has also amended the AVCA Regulations to prescribe phorate as a controlled chemical as per the 
Convention. 

This amendment ensures that Australia meets its obligations under the Convention to provide participating 
parties with sufficient information about substances to allow them to assess risk and make informed 
decisions on chemical imports. 

For further information on applying for permission to export chemicals that are controlled under Schedule 2 
of the PE Regulations or the AVCA Regulations, please visit the Department of Agriculture, Water and the 
Environment website.

No. 2020/31 

Customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods -  
August 2020 

This notice sets out the arrangements for the customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, 
including spirits, beers and fuel products as a result of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) released by the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics on 29 July 2020.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act), provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the CPI by application of an 
indexation factor. The indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter 
CPI number by the previous highest June or December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 
Quarter. When the indexation factor is greater than one, the new customs duty rates are determined by the 
application of the indexation factor. When the indexation factor is less than or equal to one, no change to the 
customs duty rates are made. 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for August 2020 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 

June Quarter 2020 

December Quarter 2019 

Indexation Factor 

114.4 

116.2 

0.985 

As the indexation factor for August 2020 (0.985) is less than one, customs duty rates for the relevant 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 and Schedules 4A to 13 inclusive to the Customs Tariff, will remain at 
current levels.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods that continue to apply are set out in Table 1.

No. 2020/33 
Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 
2020-2021 

The Australian Border Force (ABF) has determined the 2020-21 allocations under the Cheese and Curd 
Quota Scheme, which it administers on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment. 
The allocation was gazetted on 08 July 2020 in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette - Tariff Concessions 
No. 2020/25. 

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 23-month 
period ending 31 May 2020, as shown in departmental records of clearances entered for home consumption.  
This calculation excludes any part of the quota that was transferred to another importer during the 23-month 
period or that was unused as at 31 May 2020. 

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, importers 
are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the financial year 
to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of 
Australian origin (returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the 
Customs Tariff Act 1995; preference circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) exist, quota is 
unable to be used. 

The cheese or curd is considered to be ‘entered for home consumption’ if: 

(a) 

an import declaration, which identifies item 55, for the goods is lodged with the ABF, and 

(b) 
airport for the discharge of cargo. 

the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port or 

Quota allocations are transferable between importers.  A person may apply to transfer quota entitlements by 
completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) available at 
https://www.abf.gov.au/home .

Precursor chemicals and drug regulation amendments 

On 12 August 2020 the Criminal Code and Customs Legislation Amendment (Precursors and 
Drugs) Regulations 2020 (the Regulations) comes into effect. 

The Regulations amend the following: 

  Criminal Code Regulations 2019 (the Code Regulations) to list additional substances as 

controlled precursors and border controlled precursors, 

  Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (the PE Regulations) and the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the PI Regulations) to impose controls on the 
importation and exportation of drugs, and the importation of precursors, and 

  Customs Regulation 2015 (the Customs Regulation) to include additional precursors as 

Tier 1 goods. 

Amendments in relation to precursors 

The Regulations add ten additional precursors in section 13 and twelve additional precursors in 
section 16 of the Code Regulations, as well as specifying commercial and marketable quantities for 
these substances. The Government has identified that these precursors have no known legitimate 
industrial or commercial use.  

The Regulations add relevant border controlled precursors to Schedule 4 of the PI Regulations. 
This amendment empowers the Australian Border Force to seize these substances at the border 
without a warrant if imported without the required permission. 

The Regulations amend the commercial quantities and marketable quantities for phenyl-2-
propanone (a controlled precursor and a border controlled precursor). The previous quantities are 
replaced with smaller quantities, reflecting methods for producing methamphetamine from phenyl-
2-propanone. 

The Regulations amend the Customs Regulation to enable prosecution of a person under section 
233BAA of the Customs Act 1901 for unlawful exportation and importation of precursors. This 
amendment intends to deter the unlawful exportation and importation of precursors.

and tobacco products – 1 September 2020","Australian Customs Notice  
No. 2020/36 
Biannual indexation of customs duty rates for tobacco 
and tobacco products – 1 September 2020 

This notice sets out the new excise-equivalent customs duty rates on tobacco and tobacco products, 
operative from 1 September 2020. 

Indexation provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate 

Sections 19AB and 19AC of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provide for biannual indexation, 
in March and September, of the excise-equivalent customs duty rates applied to tobacco products where the 
amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis. In September, the rates are indexed by the 
average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) indexation factor and then an additional 12.5 per cent 
indexation factor. The additional indexation factor will apply to each September indexation until 2020. 

Adjustments for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ rate 

Section 19ACA of the Customs Tariff Act provides for biannual adjustments of the excise-equivalent customs 
duty rates applied to tobacco products where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per kilogram’ 
or a ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ basis. The new rate is determined by dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ 
rate by the applicable weight conversion factor. From 1 September 2020, the new rate is determined by 
dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ rate by the weight conversion factor, 0.0007. The new rate commences at the 
same time as the indexed ‘per stick’ rate. 

Calculation of excise-equivalent customs duty rates operative from 1 September 2020 

On 13 August 2020, the Australia Bureau of Statistics released the AWOTE figure for the June Quarter 2020 
(1713.9). The AWOTE Indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most recent AWOTE figure by the 
highest AWOTE figure for a previous June or December quarter that does not precede the 
2012 December Quarter. 

The AWOTE indexation factor is only applied when it is greater than 1. The 12.5 per cent additional 
indexation factor is applied to all September indexations.

No. 2020/37 

Objectionable Goods  
‘advocating the doing of a terrorist act’  
From 27 August 2020, the definition of ‘advocating the doing of a terrorist act’ has been amended 
in Regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (PI Regulations) and 
Regulation 3 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (PE Regulations). This 
amendment aligns the definition with the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) 
Act 1995 and the Criminal Code Act 1995.  

Definition of ‘doing a terrorist act’  

Paragraph 4A(1B)(c) of the PI Regulations and paragraph 3(2A)(c) of the PE Regulations prohibit 
the import and export of goods that ‘advocate the doing of a terrorist act’ if the goods praise the 
doing of a terrorist act and there is a risk that such praise might lead a person to engage in a 
terrorist act. The amended Regulations now require the risk be ‘substantial’. 

Paragraphs 4A(1B)(a) of the PI Regulations and 3(2A)(a) of the PE Regulations prescribe that 
goods will advocate the doing of a terrorist act if they ‘counsel or urge’ such acts. The amended 
Regulations now include material that ‘promotes’ and ‘encourages’ the doing of a terrorist act. 

Further information 

For information regarding these changes, please consult the relevant legislation, including the 
explanatory statement, at https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L01046.

No. 2020/43 

Expansion of Origin Waiver benefit for Australian 
Trusted Traders  

The Australian Border Force is extending the Australian Trusted Trader (ATT) Origin Waiver benefit to four 
additional trade agreements: 

  Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement (AHKFTA) for importations after 17 January 2020; 

 

Indonesia‑Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA) for importations 
after 11 February 2020; 

  Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement (PAFTA) for importations after 5 July 2020; and 

  Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‑Pacific Partnership for importations after 5 

November 2020. 

This is an expansion of the existing ATT Origin Waiver benefit provisions, available in ACN no. 2019/23 and 
ACN no. 2020/18. 

The ATT Origin Waiver benefit waives the requirement for Certificates or Declarations of Origin for Trusted 
Traders importing originating goods under the trade agreements covered by the benefit. 

Trusted Trader importers will still need to keep evidence (for at least five years from the day of importation) 
that imported goods comply with the relevant rules of origin, and present this if asked. Examples of evidence 
include commercial documentation and contracts, and statements about manufacturing process, materials 
and compliance with cost requirements from manufacturers. 

The evidence will need to prove that the goods meet the relevant Division of the Customs Act 1901 and rules 
of origin for the relevant trade agreement. If available under the provisions of the relevant trade agreement, 
Trusted Trader importers may be able to meet a request for evidence of origin by obtaining a retrospective 
Certificate or Declaration of Origin. 

Where a Trusted Trader importer has paid duty on goods imported after the applicable ATT Origin Waiver 
commencement date, they are able to apply for a refund of overpaid duties using the benefit. An application 
for a refund must include documentary evidence of origin, such as the commercial documentation and 
manufacturer’s statements. 

This waiver does not apply to exports made by Trusted Traders to parties to any trade agreement.

- 

ensuring records are available at all reasonable times for examination by an Australian Border Force 
(ABF) officer to show that import duty was paid on the goods, and relevant details of the receipt and 
disposal of the goods by the owner;  

providing the ABF with notice in writing of the owner’s intention to claim duty drawback on the 
exportation (a pre-exportation notice), before the goods are exported; 

before exportation, ensuring the goods are available at all reasonable times for examination by an 
officer;  

the legal owner of the goods at the time the goods are exported must lodge the drawback claim 
within the period starting on the day on which the goods are exported and ending 12 months after 
the day on which the goods were exported; and 

ensuring that the amount claimed does not exceed the amount of import duty paid on the relevant 
imported goods and is at least AUD100. 

The pre-exportation notice should be sent to the ABF at: TobaccoDrawbacks@abf.gov.au at least five 
business days before the exportation, to allow a reasonable time for the ABF to consider and issue a notice 
requiring certain action to be done before exportation. The pre-exportation notice should include the 
following details: 

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

owner’s name and Australian Business Number;

Arrangement for goods imported under the 
Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement 

The Agreement to Amend the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (the SAFTA Amendment 
Agreement) provided for a transition period, where the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement’s original 
rules of origin and the amended rules of origin would both apply.  

In accordance with the SAFTA Amendment Agreement, importers can only claim preferential tariff treatment 
for goods imported on or after 1 December 2020 if the goods are Singaporean originating goods within the 
requirements of Division 1BA of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act) (SAFTA amended rules 
of origin). Unless otherwise indicated in Schedule 4A of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act), 
the preferential rate of customs duty for Singaporean originating goods is “Free”. 

For goods imported before 1 December 2020, importers continue to have the option to claim preferential 
tariff treatment as goods that are the produce or manufacture of Singapore within the requirements of 
Division 1B of Part VIII of the Customs Act (original rules of origin). Importers of goods imported on or after 
1 December 2020 cannot claim this preferential tariff treatment for their imported goods. 

Claiming originating status and preferential customs duty rates from 
1 December 2020 

To be eligible for preferential rates as Singaporean originating goods from 1 December 2020, the goods 
must satisfy the rules of origin requirements under Division 1BA of Part VIII of the Customs Act including 
meeting the consignment provisions.   

Further information about claiming a preferential rate of duty for Singaporean originating goods under the 
Division 1BA requirements is contained in the Singapore - Australia Free Trade Agreement Rules of Origin 
Procedural Instructions. 

Record keeping requirements 

Exporters who have used the SAFTA original rules of origin to claim preference for goods exported to 
Singapore, must maintain relevant records, consistent with the requirements that applied at the time of 
export.

No. 2020/51 

Repeal of the export control on goods essential to 
controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19  

From 11 December 2020, regulation 13GI and regulation 13GJ of the Customs (Prohibited 
Exports) Regulations 1958 (the Regulations) are repealed. These regulations imposed a temporary 
prohibition on the export of specified goods that contribute to controlling and preventing the spread 
of COVID-19, including personal protective equipment and disinfectants. 

The Government introduced regulation 13GI and regulation 13GJ on 30 March 2020 to deter 
profiteering and exploitative exports of goods essential for combatting COVID-19, while preserving 
legitimate commercial and humanitarian trade in these goods. These measures were part of the 
Government’s initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Government has reviewed the temporary export control and has determined that the control 
has fulfilled its purpose of preventing the diversion of essential goods and profiteering and is no 
longer necessary. The Government has therefore decided to remove the temporary export control 
to support Australia’s economic recovery. This repeal reflects the changed circumstances that 
many Australian companies have recalibrated their operations to produce personal protective 
equipment for the domestic and export markets. The repeal will assist Australia’s international 
reputation as a reliable regional and global partner.

No. 2020/52 

 Implementation of the Recycling and Waste 
Reduction Act 2020 

With effect from 1 January 2021, Australia will regulate the exportation of waste glass under the Recycling 
and Waste Reduction Act 2020 (the Act) and the Recycling and Waste Reduction (Export-Waste Glass) 
Rules 2020 (the Glass Rules). These measures will require exporters to hold a waste export licence and 
declare each export consignment of waste glass to the Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment 
(DAWE). 

DAWE will administer licences to export waste glass, which will be valid for up to three years and will be 
subject to conditions. Exporters will need to meet the requirements of the Act and the Glass Rules in order 
for the Minister for Environment to consider granting a waste export licence.  

The commencement of the Act and the Glass Rules ensures that Australia will only export waste glass that 
has been processed and meets certain requirements. The intent of the measure is to prevent unprocessed 
materials from being dumped overseas – which can cause harm to the environment and human health. 

Australia will introduce Rules for waste plastics, tyres and paper in later stages. Exporters of these materials 
will need a licence to export by the required regulation date. Rules for plastics are expected to come into 
effect on 1 July 2021 (stage 1) and 1 July 2022 (stage 2); tyres on 1 December 2021; and paper and 
cardboard on 1 July 2024.

No. 2021/01 
Definition of ‘consignment’ for the purposes of section 
68 of the Customs Act 1901 

This advice supersedes ACN 2006/59. 

Importers should take steps to understand their obligations. Providing false or misleading information to the 
Australian Border Force (ABF) is a strict liability offence under sections 243T and 243U of the Customs Act 
1901 (Customs Act). 

Meaning of Consignment 

Section 68 of the Customs Act requires imported goods to be entered for home consumption or for 
warehousing, by submitting an import or warehouse declaration. Paragraphs 68(1)(e) and (f) provide that 
section 68 does not apply to goods (other than prescribed goods) included in a consignment that has a value 
not exceeding AUD1000 (see section 26 of the Customs Regulation 2015).  

The fundamental factor when determining whether goods form a consignment is whether the goods are a 
single arranged shipment from a consignor to a consignee. A consignment may be initiated unilaterally by 
the consignor (for example, a company sending unsolicited promotional material), but most commercial 
consignments will be made by the consignor upon receipt of an order from the consignee. At its simplest, a 
consignment will consist of a single order and will generally (but not always) be transported to Australia in 
the same ship or aircraft. Multiple packages will also form a single consignment where those packages are 
‘known to be part of the same order’. Therefore, where the total value of all the packages forming an order 
from a consignor to a consignee exceeds AUD1000, the goods must be formally entered in accordance with 
the provisions of section 68.  

A consignment with a value of AUD1000 or less must be entered on a self-assessed clearance (SAC) 
declaration (except if it is consigned through the Post Office). While a SAC declaration is not required for a 
consignment of goods imported by post with a value of AUD1000 or less (paragraph 29(d) of the Customs 
Regulation 2015 refers), the same principle for determining the composition of a consignment applies equally 
to postal goods. 

Where the ABF questions the legitimacy of the consignment, ABF officers can seek further information or 
supporting documentation (for example order records, invoices, packing lists), to assist in verifying whether 
or not goods constitute one consignment. 

Definition of ‘consignor’ and ‘consignee’ 

Paragraph 64AB(5)(a) of the Customs Act defines a consignor for the purposes of cargo reports as a 
supplier of goods who is located outside of Australia and who either initiates the sending of goods to a 
person in Australia, or complies with a request from a person in Australia to send goods to the person.

No. 2021/03 

Renewal of Customs Broker Licences 

All customs broker licenses (nominee, corporate and sole trader) will expire on 30 June 2021. 
Those customs brokers wanting to renew their licence for the next triennium (i.e. from 1 July 2021 
to 30 June 2024) will need to apply for the renewal of their licences. 

Renewal Application 

The Australian Border Force (ABF) will send the ‘Application for renewal of Customs Broker 
Licence’ pack to each customs broker. 

To ensure that the renewal package is sent to the correct postal address, customs brokers should 
check, by no later than 28 February 2021, their contact details in the Integrated Cargo System 
(ICS) are up to date. It is the responsibility of a customs broker to ensure that their contact details 
in the ICS are maintained. 

If a customs broker, wanting to renew their licence, does not receive their renewal package by 1 
April 2021, it is the responsibility of the broker to advise the Comptroller General of Customs, via 
an email to brokers.licensing@abf.gov.au, that they wish to renew their broker licence and 
facilitate the renewal process.     

Completed renewal applications will be accepted up until close of business on 29 June 2021 (the 
due date). However, it is recommended that customs brokers complete and return their renewal 
application as soon as possible to assist with the renewal process. 

A customs broker licence renewal application received after the due date will not be processed, 
resulting in the licence expiring on 30 June 2021. 

Renewal Fee 

Options for the payment of the renewal fee will be listed in the renewal package. Any customs 
broker electing to pay their renewal fee by BPay should take into account the delay in processing 
such payments and that such payments made towards the end of June 2021 may not be cleared 
by the due date. Where a payment is not cleared by the due date, the renewal application will be 
considered incomplete and will not be processed.  

Licence re-issue 

The ABF will send out new customs broker licences in bulk once the renewal process has been 
completed. It is estimated that the new broker licences will not be sent out until late July due to the 
number of licences being processed.   

Enquiries concerning this notice may be directed to Broker Licensing at 
brokers.licensing@abf.gov.au.

No. 2021/06 
Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent 
goods on 1 February 2021 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, beers 
and fuel products, operative from 1 February 2021.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  

The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is calculated 
by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June or 
December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. The December 2019 Quarter CPI 
figure (116.2) will be used to determine the indexation factor for the duty rate increase applied on 
1 February 2021, as it is higher than the June 2020 Quarter CPI figure (refer to ACN 2020/31).  

On 27 January 2021, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December 2020 Quarter CPI  
figure (117.2). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for February 2020 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 

December Quarter 2020 

December Quarter 2019 

Indexation Factor 

117.2 

116.2 

1.009 

As the indexation factor for February 2021 (1.009) is greater than one, customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff, will increase by the application of this factor.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 1 February 2021, are set out in 
Table 1 below and supersede the rates outlined in Australian Customs Notice 2020/05. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:  

  Schedule 4A (Singaporean originating goods)  
  Schedule 5 (US originating goods)  
  Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods) 
  Schedule 6A (Peruvian originating goods)  
  Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods)

Proposed Customs (Information Technology Requirements) Determination 2021 

The Customs (Information Technology Requirements) Determination 2021 (the 2021 Determination) is 
proposed to replace the CEO Determination No. 2 of 2010 (2010 Determination), which will cease to have 
effect on 1 April 2021, in accordance with section 50 of the Legislation Act 2003.  These Determinations are 
made under subsection 126DA(1) of the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act) which requires consultation 
with persons likely to be affected by the Determination.  

In the 2010 Determination, the Comptroller-General determined information technology requirements in 
relation to all electronic communications relating to the exportation of goods, the departure of ships and 
aircraft from Australia, imported goods and the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia. 

The 2021 Determination largely replicates the information technology requirements in the 2010 
Determination. The 2021 Determination contains some minor modifications to simplify key concepts, reflect 
updates to technology platforms used by industry and specify the information technology requirements for 
electronic nomination applications made by Australian Trusted Traders.   

Part 2 of the 2021 Determination identifies the information technology requirements for specified 
communications and signatures. This includes import declarations for goods imported through the post, 
applications to move, alter or interfere with goods for export and nominations for the Australian Trusted 
Trader (ATT) Programme. These information technology requirements remain largely unchanged from the 
2010 Determination with the exception of additionally requiring that electronic applications relating to the 
Australian Trusted Trader nominations are to be made through the website known as the ATT Portal.  

Part 3 of the 2021 Determination sets out the information technology requirements for all other electronic 
communications with the Department of Home Affairs made under Division 3 or 4 of Part IV or Division 2 of 
Part VI or section 163 or Part IX of the Customs Act, and for electronic signatures. These information 
technology requirements remain largely unchanged from the 2010 Determination with the exception of 
additionally allowing some electronic data interchange communications to be also delivered via IBM MQ. 
This is a middleware product that provides for the secure and reliable exchange of data between applications 
in the form of messages that are delivered to and read from message queues.  

Part 4 of the 2021 Determination sets out the requirements that have to be met to satisfy a requirement that 
a document be produced with the Department of Home Affairs when the document is produced 
electronically. These information technology requirements have not changed from the 2010 Determination.  

The 2021 Determination, draft below, is proposed to take effect from 31 March 2021.

No. 2021/09 
Customs duty rates for tobacco and tobacco products 
– March 2021 

This notice sets out the arrangements for the excise-equivalent customs duty rates on tobacco and tobacco 
products, as a result of the Average Weekly Ordinary Time Earnings (AWOTE) number released by the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics on 25 February 2021. 

Provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate 

Sections 19AB and 19AC of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provide for customs duty rates 
on tobacco products, where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis, to be indexed to 
the AWOTE by application of an indexation factor. The AWOTE Indexation factor is calculated by dividing 
the most recent AWOTE figure by the highest AWOTE figure for a previous June or December quarter that 
does not precede the 2012 December Quarter. When the indexation factor is greater than one, the new 
customs duty rates are determined by the application of the indexation factor. When the indexation factor is 
less than or equal to one, no change to the customs duty rates are made. 

The figures used to calculate the AWOTE indexation factor for March 2021 are set out in the table below.

As the indexation factor for March 2021 (0.999) is less than one, and where the amount of customs duty is 
determined on a ‘per stick’ basis, customs duty rates for tobacco products in Schedules 3 and 4A to 13 to the 
Customs Tariff Act will remain at current levels. 

Provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ rate 

Section 19ACA of the Customs Tariff Act provides for biannual adjustments of the excise-equivalent customs 
duty rates applied to tobacco products where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per kilogram’ 
or a ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ basis. The new rate is determined by dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ 
rate by the applicable weight conversion factor. From 1 September 2020, the new rate is determined by 
dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ rate by the weight conversion factor, 0.0007. As there is no change to the ‘per 
stick’ rate, there will be no change to the ‘per kilogram’ and the ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ rate.

New Obligations on Customs Broker Licences 

The purpose of this notice is to inform licensed customs brokers that new additional conditions will 
come into effect on 1 July 2021. The updated additional conditions are available at Attachment A. 

The additional conditions will apply to all customs broker licences under section 183CG(6) of the 
Customs Act 1901 (the Act). 

Background 

In 2016 the then Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) undertook a review of all 
licensing regimes under the Act. The Review provided an opportunity for industry and Government 
to work together to deliver improvements in licensing regimes while ensuring the cost of 
maintaining the efficiency and integrity of our border is appropriately shared with those who use it.  

After extensive consultation and engagement with stakeholders, the Reviews findings were 
outlined in the Final Report, published in December 2017, and presented recommendations for the 
Comptroller-General of Customs to consider. Recommendation 14 stated that the DIBP should re-
examine the additional conditions it includes on licences to ensure that they are sufficiently clear 
and provide guidance.  

The Australian Border Force engaged with industry on customs broker additional licence 
conditions, receiving feedback from licensed brokers and peak industry bodies. This feedback was 
considered and guided the amendments and the supplementary conditions to be implemented. 

Complying with notification requirements 

Failure to meet any condition(s) of a customs broker licence constitutes a breach under section 
183CGC of the Act. Breaching this section of the Act can result in an infringement notice being 
issued, further conditions being placed on the licence, suspension or cancellation of the licence or 
prosecution.

Part 1 of the Amendment Act incorporates Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2020 and Customs Tariff 
Proposal (No. 2) 2020. This measure commences retroactively on 1 February 2020, reflecting the 
commencement of concessional Item 57 to Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act. From 1 February 2020, 
Item 57, and then Item 57A, provided concessional treatment for prescribed hygiene and medical supplies to 
respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Importers should be aware that the commencement of this measure does not change the existing 
administrative requirements for importing goods under the relevant concessional items. Importers must 
continue to enter the relevant Schedule 4 Item number, Instrument number and the Treatment Code as 
outlined in ACN 2020/20, ACN 2020/30 and ACN 2020/53. 

29 March 2021 Commencement 

Removal of the $12,000 special duty on used and second-hand motor vehicles 

The Amendment Act removes the $12,000 special duty on used and second-hand motor vehicles under the 
Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement (PAFTA) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for 
Trans Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This measure aligns the customs duty payable for these goods with their 
treatment across the Customs Tariff Act and under other Free Trade Agreements to which Australia is a 
Party.   

New tariff classifications for formulated caffeinated beverages, formulated sports food and 
formulated supplementary foods 

Tariff subheadings 2202.10.00, 2106.90.10 and 2106.90.90 to Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act are 
repealed. Goods previously classified to these repealed tariff subheadings will be classified under new tariff 
subheadings for formulated caffeinated beverages, formulated sports food and formulated supplementary 
foods. New Additional Notes to Chapters 21 and 22 of Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act define these 
products by reference to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code.

No. 2021/13 
Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 
2021-2022 

The Australian Border Force will shortly contact Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme holders to discuss quota 
allocations for 2021-2022. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the importer’s usage of quota, as shown 
in the Department’s records of Import Declarations, which were entered for home consumption between 
01  July 2019 and 31 May 2021. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, 
importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the 
financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd 
importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under 
Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, then the quota cannot be used.  Similarly, if preference 
circumstances or Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), as listed in the various schedules of the Customs Tariff 
Act 95 apply, then the quota is not available.  

Pursuant to subsections 71A(7) and (8) of the Customs Act 1901, the cheese or curd is ‘entered for home 
consumption’ on the latter of the following two dates: 

(a)
(b)

the date of original lodgment; Or
the date of the arrival of the vessel or aircraft at the first Australian port or airport at which any cargo
is intended to be discharged.

Please note that: 


The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer during the
23-month period or that remains unused at 31 May 2021
For the 2022-23 allocation period, the allocation will be calculated by the sum of:

a) all quota entered for home consumption in 2020-21, and
b) all quota entered for home consumption between 01 July 2021 and 31 May 2022

Note. Goods entered for home consumption between 01 June and 30 June 2022 will be included in the 
2023-2024 allocation 

Quota allocated in a particular financial year cannot be used to amend declarations entered for home
consumption during a previous financial year





At this time of the year, quota holders should take stock of quota balances with a view to optimising usage 
and consequently maximising their next allocation.

Item 39A of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides a ‘Free’ rate of customs 
duty for goods that are for use in the testing, quality control, manufacturing evaluation or engineering 
development of certain motor vehicles in Australia. Item 39A commences on 1 April 2021. 

Item 39A 

Goods, as prescribed by by‑law, that are for use in the testing, quality control, 
manufacturing, evaluation or engineering development of: 

a) motor vehicles designed or engineered, or in the process of being designed or
engineered, in Australia by a person who was registered as an automotive
service provider under the Automotive Transformation Scheme (within the
meaning of the Automotive Transformation Scheme Act 2009) on
30 March 2021; or

b) components for inclusion in such motor vehicles;

where the time for working out the rate of duty on the goods is in the period beginning 
on 1 April 2021 and ending at the end of 30 June 2025. 

Rate 

Free 

Eligibility of goods 

Eligible goods are those: 

prescribed by Customs By-law No. 2100084; and


 where the time for working out the rate of duty on the goods is in the period beginning on

1 April 2021 and ending at the end of 30 June 2025.

Item 39A will apply to the same scope of goods as part (b) of item 39. Item 39A does not apply to motor 
vehicle producers, as there were none registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme (within the 
meaning of the Automotive Transformation Scheme Act 2009) on 30 March 2021, 

Importers seeking to use Item 39A should record this by listing treatment code 839 on the import declaration 
for goods of a value greater than $1000, or on the self-assessed clearance for goods of a value of $1000 or 
less. 

Use of item 39 from 1 April 2021 

As the Automotive Transformation Scheme has now closed, from 1 April 2021 importers will no longer be 
able to claim concessional treatment for goods under Item 39 to Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act.

Customs Amendment (Product Specific Rule 
Modernisation) Act 2021 

The Customs Amendment (Product Specific Rule Modernisation) Act 2021 (the Amendment Act) 
commences on 9 April 2021. 

The Amendment Act amends the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) to simplify the way that changes to 
product specific rules (PSRs) are given legal effect in customs legislation.  

The full text of the Amendment Act and explanatory material is available on the Federal Register of 
Legislation (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2021A00004). 

Approach to giving legal effect to PSRs in customs legislation 

From the commencement of the Amendment Act, legal effect will automatically be given to new or revised 
PSRs agreed to under the following agreements: 

  Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement; 

  Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement; 

  Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement; 

  Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement; 

  Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement; and  

  Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. 

As the PSRs for each of these agreements will apply by direct reference in the Customs Act, the Amendment 
Act removes the need to prescribe the PSRs in regulations. This process has been used to implement Free 
Trade Agreements since 2017. 

The Amendment Act will not change the substance of the PSRs. 

Similar amendments were made by the Customs Amendment (Product Specific Rule Modernisation) Act 
2018. For further information, please see ACN 2018/39. 

The substance of the PSRs have not been changed by the Amendment Act.

New firearm serial number requirements under the 
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956  

On 24 March 2021, Schedule 2 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment (Firearms) Regulations 
2020 (the Amendment Regulations) commenced. The Amendment Regulations change the serial number 
requirements for firearms, frames and receivers under Schedule 6 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) 
Regulations 1956 (the Regulations).  

The Amendments 

From 24 March 2021, all imported firearms, frames and receivers must bear a unique serial number unless 
exempt. 

For whole firearms, the serial number must be located on the frame or receiver of the firearm. 

Under these changes, all frames and receivers imported must also bear a unique serial number when 
imported on their own. 

The serial number must consist only of Arabic numerals (0-9), English letters or punctuation marks and be 
made up using any combination of these. It must also be legible, easily recognisable as the serial number 
and read without the use of a device or tool. 

Firearms, frames and receivers exempt from the changes include any: 

 Manufactured prior to 1 January 1900

 Not subject to the requirements of Schedule 6 of the Regulations such as:

o

o

Imported by Defence forces of certain countries for official exercises

Imported by air security officers

o Transhipped firearms

o Firearms returning to Australia from lawful hunting or shooting competitions.

Where goods arrive at the border that are not compliant with the regulatory requirements, the goods may be 
subject to seizure by the Australian Border Force as prohibited imports.  

A prescribed approach to the location, format and appearance of unique serial numbers will improve the 
recording of data in firearms systems. This will assist police and other law enforcement agencies to manage 
the registration, licensing and movement of firearms, frames and receivers being imported into Australia and 
being moved between states and territories.

2021-06-29,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2021-20.pdf,New by-law for superyachts undertaking repairs,"Australian Customs Notice  
No. 2021/20 
New by-law for superyachts undertaking repairs 

To support the longer-term growth of Australia's maritime services industry, the Australian Border Force (ABF) 
has reviewed the arrangements available for superyachts to enter Australia for repair or alteration without the 
requirement to immediately export the vessel on completion of these activities. 

Amendment to Item 21 of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 

A new by-law has been made under Item 21 of Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Item 21) which will 
apply to superyachts which enter Australia for repair and alteration.   

Item 21 provides a duty rate of ‘Free’ and an exemption from Goods and Services Tax (GST) for goods that 
are imported for repairs or alteration and subsequently exported. A security or undertaking is required for any 
revenue liability. 

The new by-law (Customs by-law no. 2100072) allows superyachts to: 

•  enter Australia for the purposes of repair and/or alteration; 

• 

remain in Australia for up to 12 months from the date of entry for home consumption; and 

•  undertake activities other than the repair and  alteration of the vessel  within the specified 12-month 

period. 

By-law no. 1304168 has been revoked and reissued as by-law no. 2100073, to ensure the entry of superyachts 
into Australia for repair and/or alteration is facilitated exclusively through by-law no. 2100072. 

Implementation 

By-law no. 2100072 will require the importer to satisfy the ABF that repair and/or alteration of the superyacht 
will  be  the  primary  purpose  of  importation.  This  may  include  documentary  evidence  of  the  repair  and/or 
alteration activities to be performed on the superyacht, such as booking confirmations, quotes and invoices. 
Other activities, such as private cruising or chartering, may also be undertaken within the 12 month period.  

The ordinary meaning of ‘repair’ and ‘alteration’ will be used for the interpretation of this by-law. This approach 
is consistent with the Australian Taxation Office’s GSTR2005/2 for supplies of goods and services in the repair, 
renovation, modification or treatment of goods whose destination is outside Australia. 

Any superyacht seeking to use the by-law must be entered for home consumption on an import declaration. 
The relevant treatment code and by-law number should be recorded on this document. When the vessel is 
entered into home consumption, relevant legislative requirements, including for prohibited goods, will apply.   

•  Ships’ stores (including bunkers, tobacco and alcohol) must be entered into home consumption on 

separate lines of the import declaration. 

•  Permit  requirements  for  prohibited  goods  (e.g.  firearms  and  medical  kits)  must  be  met.  Prohibited

No. 2021/25 
Commencement of the Recycling and Waste 
Reduction (Export – Waste Plastics) Rules 2021  

With effect from 1 July 2021, Australia will regulate the exportation of waste plastic under the Recycling and 
Waste Reduction Act 2020 (the Act) and the Recycling and Waste Reduction (Export-Waste Plastics) Rules 
2021 (the Plastic Rules). These measures will require exporters to hold a waste export licence and declare 
each export consignment of waste plastic to the Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment (DAWE). 

DAWE administers licences to export waste plastic, which may be valid for up to three years. Waste export 
licences will be subject to conditions. Exporters need to meet the requirements of the Act and the Plastic 
Rules in order for the Minister for the Environment to consider granting a waste export licence.  

The Plastic Rules will commence in two phases. Phase one of the Plastic Rules will come into effect from 1 
July 2021 and will only allow the export of waste plastics that have been sorted into single resin or polymer 
type, or processed with other materials into processed engineered fuel. Phase two will come into effect from 
1 July 2022 and will only allow the export of waste plastics that have been sorted into single resin or polymer 
type and further processed, or processed with other materials, into processed engineered fuel. 

The commencement of the Plastic Rules on 1 July 2021 (phase two begins on 1 July 2022) ensures that 
Australia will only export waste plastic that has been processed and meets certain requirements. The intent 
of the measure is to prevent the export of unprocessed waste plastic, which is likely to have a negative 
impact on human health and the environment in the receiving country. It will also maximise the ability of the 
Australian waste and recycling sector to collect, recover, recycle, reuse and convert waste plastic into new 
products.  

Australia will introduce rules for tyres and paper in later stages. Exporters of these materials will need a 
licence to export by the required regulation date. Rules for tyres will come into effect on 1 December 2021; 
and paper and cardboard on 1 July 2024. 

For further information on the new export regulation of waste products, please visit the DAWE website or 
send your queries to exportwaste@awe.gov.au

No. 2021/28  

Expansion of Duty Deferral Benefit for Australian 
Trusted Traders 

The Australian Border Force (ABF) is expanding the Australian Trusted Trader (ATT or Trusted Traders) 
Duty Deferral benefit to become Duty Deferral Plus. Duty Deferral Plus will further reduce regulatory burden 
and improve cash flows for eligible ATTs.  

The ATT Duty Deferral benefit allows eligible Trusted Trader importers to defer the payment of duties 
collected by the ABF until the 21st day of the following month. Duty Deferral Plus will see this benefit 
expanded to include additional taxes and charges which include Import Processing Charge, Wine 
Equalisation Tax, Luxury Car Tax, the Wood Levy and Agriculture Processing Charge.  

Direct charges for services levied on some importations will still require payment on a transactional basis at 
the time of import. 

Eligibility 

The Duty Deferral Plus benefit is only available to Trusted Trader importers who defer the payment of Goods 
and Services Tax (GST) through the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) Deferred Goods and Services Tax 
Scheme. Duty Deferral Plus is not applicable on importations of excise equivalent goods and deferral does 
not apply to excise equivalent customs duties.  

Payment Schedule 

Following the month of importation, Trusted Trader importers will receive an invoice containing the liabilities 
owed on the 16th day of the month. On the 21st day of the month (or the next banking day), the import 
liabilities will be drawn from the importer’s nominated bank account. For example, duty on all applicable 
goods imported in March will be debited from the importer’s account on 21 April. 

Joining Duty Deferral Plus  

Trusted Traders who are already deferring duties will be contacted about arrangements to move to Duty 
Deferral Plus. Trusted Traders who are not yet deferring their import liabilities can speak directly to their 
Account Manager to express interest in signing up for the benefit. 

For more information about Duty Deferral Plus or if you are interested in becoming and Australian Trusted 
Trader, please refer to www.abf.gov.au/trustedtrader or email trustedtrader@abf.gov.au.

No. 2021/30 
Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent 
goods on 2 August 2021 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, beers 
and fuel products, operative from 2 August 2021.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  

The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is calculated 
by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June or 
December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. The December 2020 Quarter CPI 
figure (117.2) will be used to determine the indexation factor for the duty rate increase applied on 
2 August 2021, as it is higher than the previously used December 2019 Quarter CPI figure (refer to 
ACN 2021/06).  

On 28 July 2021, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June 2021 Quarter CPI 
figure (118.8). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for August 2021 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 

June Quarter 2021 

December Quarter 2020 

Indexation Factor 

118.8 

117.2 

1.014 

As the indexation factor for August 2021 (1.014) is greater than one, customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff, will increase by the application of this factor.  

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 2 August 2021, are set out in Table 1 
below and supersede the rates outlined in Australian Customs Notice 2021/06. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:

No. 2021/31 
Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 
2021-2022 

The Australian Border Force (ABF) has determined the 2021-22 allocations under the Cheese and Curd 
Quota Scheme, which it administers on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment. 
The allocation was gazetted on 07July 2021 in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette - Tariff Concessions 
No. 2021/24. 

The calculation of an importer’s quota is based on the actual use of quota by that importer in the 23-month 
period ending 31 May 2021, as shown in departmental records of clearances entered for home consumption.  
This calculation excludes any part of the quota that was transferred to another importer during the 23-month 
period or that was unused as at 31 May 2021. 

Please note that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, importers 
are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the financial year 
to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd importations are of 
Australian origin (returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under Schedule 3 of the 
Customs Tariff Act 1995; preference circumstances, or a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) exist, quota is 
unable to be used. 

The cheese or curd is considered to be ‘entered for home consumption’ if: 

(a) an import declaration, which identifies item 55, for the goods is lodged with the ABF, and

(b) the vessel or aircraft carrying the cheese or curd has arrived at the first Australian port or airport
for the discharge of cargo.

Quota allocations are transferable between importers.  A person may apply to transfer quota entitlements by 
completing a Transfer of Base Quota (Cheese and Curd) form (form B235) available at 
https://www.abf.gov.au/home .

Registration for the new Integrated Cargo System 
Business Continuity Plan Subscription list 

New Integrated Cargo System Business Continuity Plan System 

The Integrated Cargo System (ICS) is the only method of electronically reporting the legitimate movement of 
goods across Australia’s borders. In the event of an ICS outage or ICS slow response times, it is critical that 
industry are able to access alternative cargo reporting procedures to minimise disruption to daily business 
operations. 

The Department, in partnership with Industry and the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment 
(DAWE) developed an Integrated Cargo System Business Continuity Plan (ICS BCP). The plan and 
supporting documentation can be found on the ICS Outages Webpage at https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-
support/ics/integrated-cargo-system-(ics)/using-the-ics/outages.   

To improve the reporting and movement of critical cargo in the event of an ICS outage, a new ICS BCP 
system will be implemented from December 2021. The new system will deliver automated reports, minimise 
manual intervention and provide a new secure email channel which will protect commercial information sent 
during a BCP event. 

Register for the new subscription list

No. 2021/34 
Customs duty rates for tobacco and tobacco products 
– September 2021

This notice sets out the arrangements for the excise-equivalent customs duty rates on tobacco and tobacco 
products, as a result of the Average Weekly Ordinary Time Earnings (AWOTE) number released by the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics on 19 August 2021. 

Provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate 

Sections 19AB and 19AC of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provide for customs duty rates 
on tobacco products, where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis, to be indexed to 
the AWOTE by application of an indexation factor. The AWOTE Indexation factor is calculated by dividing 
the most recent AWOTE figure by the highest AWOTE figure for a previous June or December quarter that 
does not precede the 2012 December Quarter. When the indexation factor is greater than one, the new 
customs duty rates are determined by the application of the indexation factor. When the indexation factor is 
less than or equal to one, no change to the customs duty rates are made. 

The figures used to calculate the AWOTE indexation factor for September 2021 are set out in the table 
below.

As the indexation factor for September 2021 (1.014) is greater than one, and where the amount of customs 
duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis, customs duty rates for tobacco products in Schedules 3 and 4A 
to 13 to the Customs Tariff Act will be increased by application of the indexation factor. 

Provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ rate 

Section 19ACA of the Customs Tariff Act provides for biannual adjustments of the excise-equivalent customs 
duty rates applied to tobacco products where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per kilogram’ 
or a ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ basis. The new rate is determined by dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ 
rate by the applicable weight conversion factor. From 1 September 2020, the new rate is determined by 
dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ rate by the weight conversion factor, 0.0007.

2021-09-16,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2021-37.pdf,New Restrictions for the Import and Export of Nicotine Vaping Products,"Australian Customs Notice  
No. 2021/37 

New Restrictions for the Import and Export of  
Nicotine Vaping Products  

From 1 October 2021, all nicotine for human use, including vaping products, such as nicotine  
e-cigarettes, nicotine pods and liquid nicotine, will be contained within Schedule 4 (prescription 
only medicines) of The Poisons Standard and will be regulated at the border by the Therapeutic 
Goods Administration (TGA). These changes mean that any import of nicotine vaping products 
must comply with the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. The TGA has also introduced the TGO 110 
Standard for Nicotine Vaping Products supplied domestically within Australia to align with this 
regulatory change. 

Personal use importations 

Australian patients can access nicotine vaping products from overseas so long as they comply with 
the conditions of the personal importation scheme. Under the scheme, patients can order a 
maximum of three months' supply at one time and a maximum of 15 months' supply in a 12-month 
period. All importations must be supported by a valid prescription from an Australian medical 
practitioner at the time of import. 

Any imports which are not supported by a valid prescription or are in excess of the prescribed 
amount may be assessed by the TGA to be unlawful under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and 
may be seized as prohibited imports under the Customs Act 1901. 

Australian medical practitioners whose patients require more than a 3-month supply can apply to 
the TGA for approval to import under the Special Access Scheme or the Authorised Prescriber 
Scheme.  

Passenger exemption 

Passengers who arrive in Australia with nicotine vaping products in their accompanied baggage 
will be able to retain their products so long as they have a valid prescription and no more than a 
three month supply at the maximum recommended dosage.

2021-09-21,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2021-38.pdf,Gateway Clearance of Sea and Air Cargo,"OFFICIAL 
Australian Customs Notice No. 2021/38 

Gateway Clearance of Sea and Air Cargo 
From 1 October 2021, the Australian Border Force (ABF) will facilitate the Gateway Clearance of sea cargo.  
Gateway Clearance is the release of goods into home consumption from the Port of Discharge, regardless of 
the final delivery destination. This process has been in place for many years for air cargo. The change aligns 
customs and biosecurity release requirements for sea cargo with those for air cargo. 

Previously, the ABF required even cleared consignments that listed different locations for the Port of Discharge 
and Port of Destination (on the Sea Cargo Report) to move under customs control from the Port of Discharge 
to the Port of Destination prior to release into home consumption.   

Gateway Clearance for sea cargo has been endorsed by the Comptroller-General of Customs and facilitated 
through  amendments  to  existing  approved  statements  (available  from  abf.gov.au)  for  cargo  reporting  and 
import-related declarations in the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) covering both air and sea freight.  

From 1 October 2021 the information required in ICS for the Port Code Destination (or Destination Port Code) 
field is: 

The UN/LOCODE for the place where the  goods are requested to be, or were, released into home 
consumption or entered into a warehouse. 

UN/LOCODE stands for ""United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations"".   

The new definition applies to information provided in the ICS to meet the following legislative requirements of 
the Customs Act 1901: 

Customs Act 1901 reference

Gateway Clearance for air cargo: No changes 

While  Gateway  Clearance  has  been  in  place  for  air  cargo  for  many  years,  the  ABF  has  never  formally 
acknowledged the practice. This ACN notifies the air freight industry that the definition of Port of Destination 
has been aligned on the Air Cargo Report to formally facilitate Gateway Clearance for air cargo. No changes 
to customs or biosecurity practice for air cargo arise from the implementation of Gateway Clearance for sea 
cargo.

No. 2021/39 
Home Affairs Type 3 Digital Certificate Replacement 
The Department of Home Affairs’ existing Type 3 digital certificate will be replaced with a new 
SHA2 Gatekeeper certificate on 29 September 2021. 

This means that users who send messages to the Integrated Cargo System (in both Industry Test 
and Production), using electronic data interchange (EDI) must continue to use the current Home 
Affairs certificate until 23:59, 28 September 2021 and must switch to the new Home Affairs 
certificate from 29 September 2021. 

This replacement does not affect any digital certificates you or your organisation may have 
purchased. 

Who does the changeover affect? 

If you, your company, or your clients are communicating with Home Affairs using any type 
of EDI package, it will be necessary to install the new Home Affairs SHA2 Gatekeeper 
certificate into your EDI Application. Please note that Home Affairs does not provide 
technical support for 3rd Party Software packages. 

The changeover does not affect organisations who only use Cargo Interactive (CI). 

What should I do? 

A copy of the new Home Affairs Type 3 certificate can be downloaded from this page: 
https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support/ics/integrated-cargo-system-(ics)/using-the-ics/digital-
certificates 

The Department will be changing over to the new certificate during the 00:00-04:00 outage 
window on Wednesday 29 September 2021. 

Clients must continue to use the existing Home Affairs certificate for all EDI message 
transactions up until 23:59 on Tuesday 28 September 2021, and then use the new Home 
Affairs certificate for all EDI message transactions from Wednesday 29 September 2021 
onwards. 

All messages sent by the Department after the changeover outage will be signed using the 
new Home Affairs certificate, so at that point if you have not yet changed your systems to 
use the new certificate, your EDI software will fail to authenticate new messages and will 
reject them.

No. 2021/44 
Commencement of the Recycling and Waste 
Reduction (Export – Waste Tyres) Rules 2021  

With effect from 1 December 2021, Australia will regulate the exportation of waste tyres under the Recycling 
and Waste Reduction Act 2020 (the Act) and the Recycling and Waste Reduction (Export-Waste Tyres) 
Rules 2021 (the Tyres Rules). These measures will require exporters to hold a waste export licence and 
declare each export consignment of waste tyres to the Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment 
(DAWE). 

DAWE will administer licences to export waste tyres, which may be valid for up to three years. Waste export 
licences will be subject to conditions. Exporters need to meet the requirements of the Act and the Tyres 
Rules in order for the Minister or delegate to consider granting a waste export licence.  

The commencement of the Tyres Rules ensures that Australia will only export waste tyres that are 
appropriately processed or will be retread or re-used appropriately overseas. The intent of the measure is to 
prevent the export of unprocessed and densely packed waste tyres, which are likely to have a negative 
impact on human health and the environment in the receiving country. It will also maximise the ability of the 
Australian waste and recycling sector to collect, recover and recycle waste tyres.  

Australia will introduce rules for the export of paper and cardboard commencing on 1 July 2024 and will also 
restrict the export of unprocessed single polymer waste plastic from 1 July 2022. Exporters of permitted 
waste materials will need to obtain an export licence by the required regulation date. 

For further information on the new export regulation of waste products, please visit the DAWE website or 
send your queries to exportwaste@awe.gov.au.

No. 2021/46 

Commercial Pilot – Importing Kava as a Food Product – 
Amendments to the   
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 

From 1 December 2021, commercial entities will be able to apply to the Office of Drug Control for 
permission to import kava as a food, under new Regulation 5F of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) 
Regulations 1956 (the Regulations).  

Kava as a food product 

New regulation 5F defines kava as a food product as mentioned in section 2.6.3-3 of the Australia 
New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code), as in force at 1 December 2021. The Code 
describes kava as ‘a beverage obtained by the aqueous suspension of kava root using cold water 
only, and not using any organic solvent; or dried or raw kava root’. 

Biosecurity requirements apply and not all of the kava products listed in the Code may be able to 
be imported. On 1 December 2021 only powdered kava or kava beverage will be able to satisfy the 
biosecurity requirements. 

Permits only available to commercial entities 

Consumers will not be able to directly import a kava food product. Permits are only available to 
commercial entities: 

importing the kava for the purpose of selling it as part of the applicant’s business; 
registered for GST; and  

 
 
  have an ABN. 

Declaring an importation of kava as a food 

The existing regulation 5 of the Regulations which prohibits the import of kava for use as a drug will 
not change. 

Importers of kava as a food will only require a permit under regulation 5F, a regulation 5 permit will 
not be required. Similarly, importers of kava under regulation 5 will only require a regulation 5 
permit and will not require a permit under regulation 5F.

No. 2021/47 
Firearms and Weapons – Amendments to the  
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 

From 15 December 2021, the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment (Firearms and Weapons) 
Regulations 2021 amended the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the Regulations) 
for the lawful importation of firearms and weapons. 

The amendments ensure that the community remains protected from new and emerging firearms 
and weapons technologies, reduces red tape and regulatory burden for legitimate importers, and 
improves the administrative efficiency of the Regulations. 

Strict procedures remain in place to ensure that only those with a lawful need to import firearms 
and weapons into Australia are able to do so provided they meet certain conditions and 
requirements. The penalties for importing prohibited firearms and weapons without a permit can 
include a fine of up to 2,500 penalty units (currently $555,000), imprisonment for up to 10 years, or 
both. 

The Amendments 

  Expand the circumstances in which firearms and weapons can be imported under the 
official purposes test, to allow the importation of such goods by persons who are 
subcontractors to primary government contractors or tenderers. 

  Remove the requirement that importers need to have a proven history of developing or 
producing defence or law enforcement related products before being granted an import 
permit for firearms and weapons under the specified purposes test. 

 

Introduce a new import prohibition on barrel extensions, to be defined as a firearm part. 

  Streamline the tests that apply in relation to the importation of certain firearms and their 

parts and magazines. 

  Add self-opening repeating action shotguns to Schedule 6 to ensure their importation would 

be appropriately classified and controlled. 

  Consolidate the importation test that applies for paintball markers and related articles into a 

single table item in the Regulations. 

  Clearly distinguish the electro-shock cartridges that can be imported as ammunition for a 
firearm from those that could be imported as a part for a hand held electric shock device.

No. 2021/49 
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership 
Agreement – Entry into Force 

On 1 January 2022, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) will enter into 
force for Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Japan, Laos, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. 

RCEP originating goods 

Goods must meet the requirements outlined in Division 1N of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 
(Customs Act) to be considered RCEP originating goods.  

From 1 January 2022, only materials sourced from Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Japan, Laos, 
New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are considered as originating materials for the purposes of 
determining whether a good is an RCEP originating good.  

Goods and materials from the remaining RCEP signatories, namely Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar 
and the Philippines are not considered as originating materials until RCEP enters into force for that 
signatory. Under subsection 153ZQB(6) of the Customs Act, the Minister must announce by notifiable 
instrument, the day on which the Agreement enters into force for a Party (other than Australia).  

Preferential rates of customs duty and duty rate phase down 

Schedule 14 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) outlines the preferential rates of customs 
duty that apply to RCEP originating goods including customs duty rates for goods that will be incrementally 
reduced to ‘Free’. Schedule 14 provides the preferential rate that will apply for each relevant tariff 
subheadings on 1 January 2022, any incremental reductions to the preferential customs duty rate, and the 
day on which those reductions commence.  

All RCEP originating goods classified to tariff subheadings that are not listed in Schedule 14 have a ‘Free’ 
rate of customs duty at entry into force of RCEP.  

Excise-equivalent goods that are classified to tariff subheadings listed in Schedule 14 will be indexed with 
the equivalent rates listed in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act.  

The preferential rates of customs duty for RCEP originating goods will be available on the Online Tariff from 
1 January 2022. The updated Customs Tariff Working Pages for Schedule 14 are at Attachment A. As 
RCEP enters into force on 1 January 2022, these pages are in 2022 Harmonized System (HS2022) 
nomenclature. Detailed information about HS2022 can be found on the Australian Border Force 2022

No. 2021/50 
Customs Tariff Changes for 1 January 2022 

This Australian Customs Notice (ACN) provides guidance on customs tariff changes that will commence on 
1 January 2022. 

2022 Harmonized System Implementation 

The 2022 Harmonized System will commence on 1 January 2022. All information relating to the 
implementation of the 2022 Harmonized System can be found on the 2022 Harmonized System web page - 
2022 Harmonized System Changes (abf.gov.au). 

Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs) 

The Australian Border Force (ABF) has completed a review of TCOs affected by the implementation of the 
2022 Harmonized System (HS2022).  

A concordance of TCOs outlining which will be revoked and which will be remade will be made available on 
the 2022 Harmonized System Changes web page. For TCOs that will be remade, the concordance will set 
out the HS2022 classification for the new TCO. 

Two special Tariff Gazettes will be issued on 11 and 13 January 2022. 

Tariff Advices (TAs) 

In December 2021, the ABF will void TAs affected by the HS2022 changes. A list of the tariff classifications 
will be made available on the 2022 Harmonized System Changes web page.  

Importers who wish to seek a new TA to replace one that will be voided will need to submit a new TA 
application through the TAPIN system on or after 1 January 2022. TAPIN will reject TA applications 
submitted before 1 January 2022, which refer to HS2022 classifications. 

Tariff Precedents 

The ABF has reviewed existing Tariff Precedents affected by HS2022. After 1 January 2022, these 
precedents will be voided or altered as required. Further advice will be published at that time. 

Customs Tariff By-laws 

Customs Tariff By-law No. 1700051 will be revoked and replaced by Customs Tariff By-law No. 2100221 (the 
new by-law). The tariff classifications referenced in the new by-law will be updated to reflect HS2022 
classifications. The text of the new by-law can be accessed on the Federal Register of Legislative 
Instruments. Revised Tariff Working Pages can be found on the 2022 Harmonized System Changes web 
page.

No. 2021/51 
2022 Harmonized System Product Specific Rules of 
Origin for Free Trade Agreements 

On 1 January 2022, some tariff classifications in the Customs Tariff Act 1995 will change as a result of 
amendments to implement the 2022 Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS2022).  

Detailed information about HS2022 can be found on the Australian Border Force (ABF) 2022 Harmonized 
System Changes web page. 

Free Trade Agreements 

Implementation of the HS2022 changes will require amendments to the Product Specific Rules of Origin 
(PSRs) in Australia’s sixteen free trade agreements (FTAs) - see Attachment A for a list of these FTAs. 

The Australian Government needs to negotiate with FTA partners to finalise and implement the transposition 
to HS2022 of the PSR for these FTAs. When relevant processes under the FTA to implement HS2022 
changes have been completed in respect of the PSR schedules for that FTA, further ACNs will be published 
to notify of the commencement of that PSRs in HS2022. 

Until these ACNs are issued, the ABF will continue to accept valid origin documentation under an FTA such 
as Certificates of Origin (COO) or Declarations of Origin (DOO) with prior versions of the HS classifications 
for goods imported into Australia where that version of the HS classification is the one used in the PSR.  

The current version of the HS used in the PSR can be found under product specific rules of origin on the 
ABF FTA webpage for that agreement. Alternatively, column three of the Table in Attachment A lists the 
version of the HS in use for that agreement at the time of publication of this ACN. 

In cases where the origin documentation has been issued with HS2017, or an earlier version of the HS 
classification, the importer must be careful to ensure that the goods are classified using HS2022 on the 
import declaration.

No. 2022/05 
Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent 
goods on 1 February 2022 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, beers 
and fuel products, operative from 1 February 2022.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  

The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is calculated 
by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June or 
December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. The June 2021 Quarter CPI figure 
(118.8) will be used to determine the indexation factor for the duty rate increase applied on 1 February 2022, 
as it is higher than the previously used December 2020 Quarter CPI figure (refer to ACN 2021/30).  

On 25 January 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December 2021 Quarter CPI  
figure (121.3). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for February 2022 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 

December Quarter 2021 

June Quarter 2021 

Indexation Factor 

121.3 

118.8 

1.021 

As the indexation factor for February 2022 (1.021) is greater than one, customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff, will increase by the application of this factor.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 1 February 2022, are set out in 
Table 1 below and supersede the rates outlined in Australian Customs Notice 2021/30. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:  

  Schedule 4A (Singaporean originating goods)  
  Schedule 5 (US originating goods)  
  Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods) 
  Schedule 6A (Peruvian originating goods)  
  Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods)

Electromagnetic Weapons – Amendments to the  
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 

From 10 February 2022, the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment (Electromagnetic Weapons) 
Regulations 2022 amends the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the Regulations) to control 
the importation of electromagnetic weapons under schedule 13 of the Regulations. 

The amendment ensures that the community remains protected from new and emerging weapons 
technologies. 

Strict procedures remain in place to ensure that only those with a lawful need to import weapons and their 
parts into Australia are able to do so provided they meet certain conditions and requirements. The penalties 
for importing prohibited weapons without a permit can include a fine of up to 2,500 penalty units (currently 
$555,000), imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both. 

Weapons are prohibited on entry to Australia unless permission has been granted in accordance with the 
requirements in schedule 13 of the Regulations. Part 2 of schedule 13 of the Regulations list prohibited 
weapons. 

Changes to weapons import requirements: 

Electromagnetic weapons or similar devices, are defined as ‘a device designed or adapted to propel or 
launch any substance by means of electromagnetic force and, when discharged, are capable of causing; 
a) damage to property; or b) bodily harm’, and their parts, are now expressly prohibited under new items 48 
and 49 of part 2 of schedule 13 of the Regulations. Permission is required from the Australian Border Force 
in order to import these goods to Australia. 

This amendment does not alter the existing control on electromagnetic weapons that are designed or 
adapted for warfare or like purposes under item 1 of schedule 13 of the Regulations. 

For further information regarding these changes, please consult the legislation directly, including the 
explanatory statement (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2022L00113).

Australian Bureau of Statistics on 24 February 2022. 

Provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per stick’ rate 

Sections 19AB and 19AC of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provide for customs duty rates 
on tobacco products, where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis, to be indexed to 
the AWOTE by application of an indexation factor. The AWOTE Indexation factor is calculated by dividing 
the most recent AWOTE figure by the highest AWOTE figure for a previous June or December quarter that 
does not precede the 2012 December Quarter. When the indexation factor is greater than one, the new 
customs duty rates are determined by the application of the indexation factor. When the indexation factor is 
less than or equal to one, no change to the customs duty rates are made. 

The figures used to calculate the AWOTE indexation factor for March 2022 are set out in the table below.

or December Quarter

0.0007 

As the indexation factor for March 2022 (1.007) is greater than one, and where the amount of customs duty 
is determined on a ‘per stick’ basis, customs duty rates for tobacco products in Schedules 3 and 4A to 14 to 
the Customs Tariff Act will be increased by application of the indexation factor. 

Provisions for tobacco products subject to a ‘per kilogram’ or ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ rate 

Section 19ACA of the Customs Tariff Act provides for biannual adjustments of the excise-equivalent customs 
duty rates applied to tobacco products where the amount of customs duty is determined on a ‘per kilogram’ 
or a ‘per kilogram of tobacco content’ basis. The new rate is determined by dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ 
rate by the applicable weight conversion factor. From 1 September 2020, the new rate is determined by 
dividing the indexed ‘per stick’ rate by the weight conversion factor, 0.0007.

No. 2022/10 
New restrictions for the importation and exportation of 
elemental mercury 

Legislation changes and permission  to import  and export mercury 

From 7 March 2022, the importation of mercury will be prohibited under the new Regulation 4AC of the 
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (PI Regulations), and the exportation of mercury will be 
further restricted with amendments to Regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 
(PE Regulations). These amendments are part of the measures taken by the Australian Government to ratify 
the international Minamata Convention on Mercury (the Convention). 

Mercury means elemental mercury (Hg(0), CAS No. 7439‑97‑6), and includes mixtures of mercury (including 
alloys of mercury) with a mercury concentration of at least 95% by weight, but does not include 
non‑Minamata mercury. This is as defined in Subregulation 2(1) of the PI Regulations and Subregulation 
2(1) of the PE Regulations.  

Amendments were also made to the below legislation, prohibiting and restricting trade and manufacture of 
mercury and certain mercury products, to account for the uses of mercury across a range of industries. 
Permission to import and export mercury will be required from the relevant Minister or authorised officer, 
depending on the intended use of the mercury. Permission can be granted under any one of the below 
legislation and through the relevant agency noted.  

  The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Regulations 1995 – administered by the 

Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE). 

  The Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 – administered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration 

(TGA), Department of Health. 

  The Industrial Chemicals (General) Rules 2019 – administered by the Office of Chemical Safety

Reporting obligations for goods exported for repair, 
alteration or renovation and subsequent re-importation 

Export Requirements 

Products that are not intended for sale must be reported to a non-merchandise trade Australian Harmonized 
Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) code on the export declaration. The quality of international trade 
statistics produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is adversely affected if classified to 
merchandise trade AHECC codes. It is also likely to create a burden to reporters as a result of follow up 
activity by the ABS to confirm the respective merchandise or non-merchandise trade status of the goods.   

The Australian Border Force (ABF) has the following requirements for classifying all goods exported for 
repair, alteration or renovation and subsequent re-importation: 

  For each line of goods - the commodity classification code (Export Statistical Item) for the goods, as 

shown in the AHECC table on the ABS website.  Goods that are being exported following sale must be 
classified to in-kind merchandise trade AHECC codes.   

o  All goods not intended for sale (e.g. they are being repaired, returned for maintenance etc.) should 
be reported as non-merchandise trade (e.g. 9901.10).  This includes goods that require an export 
permit to be obtained prior to export. 

 

If the goods are required by law to have an export permit (however described) - the numbers or codes 
identifying the required export permits, licenses, or other permissions along with a three-character permit 
prefix allocated by the ABF. 

o 

The export from Australia of goods subject to permit requirements, without a permit, is a 
contravention of section 233BAB(6) of the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act), namely, export Tier 2 
goods, which carries a maximum penalty of a fine not exceeding 2,500 penalty units or 
imprisonment for 10 years, or both. 

  A plain language description of the goods within the ‘Goods Description’ field sufficient to identify the 
nature of the goods at the level required for transport, banking, border classification or statistical 
purposes.  

o 

It is not acceptable to simply include a copy and paste of the AHECC description in this field if a 
more accurate description can be provided by way of the invoice or other commercial 
documentation.

Trusted Traders to the Regional Comprehensive 
Economic Partnership Agreement","Australian Customs Notice  
No. 2022/13 

Expansion of the Origin Waiver benefit for Australian 
Trusted Traders to the Regional Comprehensive 
Economic Partnership Agreement 

The Australian Border Force is extending the Australian Trusted Trader (ATT) Origin Waiver benefit to the 
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) from 1 January 2022.  

This is an expansion of the existing ATT Origin Waiver benefit provisions, available in ACN 2019/23, 
ACN 2020/18, ACN 2020/43.and ACN 2020/48  

The ATT Origin Waiver benefit means ATT importers are no longer required to obtain or present an RCEP 
Proof of Origin, such as a Certificate of Origin or a Declaration of Origin, in order to claim preferential rates of 
duty under RCEP for RCEP originating goods. 

Trusted Trader importers are still required to keep evidence for a period of at least five years from the day of 
importation that imported goods comply with the relevant rules of origin and present this evidence if 
requested. Examples of evidence can include: proof of the last place of manufacture; commercial 
documentation and contracts; statements in relation to manufacturing process; and materials and 
compliance with cost requirements from manufacturers.  

The evidence will need to prove that the goods meet the requirements of Division 1N of the 
Customs Act 1901 and the RCEP rules of origin. Trusted Trader importers may be able to meet a request for 
evidence of origin by obtaining a Proof of Origin from the producer or exporter. 

Where a Trusted Trader importer has paid duty on RCEP originating goods imported after 1 January 2022, 
they are able to apply for a refund of overpaid duties using the benefit. An application for a refund must 
include documentary evidence of origin, such as the commercial documentation and manufacturer’s 
statements.

1 April Import Statistical Code and Other Changes 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics has advised that from 1 April 2022, new import statistical codes and unit 
quantities will commence for products of urea, toxins and certain engineered structural timber products. New 
codes and unit quantities in the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC) for these 
goods will commence on 1 May 2022.  

New AHECC and import statistical codes for Urea products 

From 1 April 2022, new import statistical codes will commence for urea products. Importers will be required 
to enter new statistical codes for goods of urea classified to the tariff subheading 3102.10.00. New statistical 
codes will identify fertilisers of urea, technical grade urea, diesel exhaust fluid and other urea products.  

From 1 May 2022 new AHECC codes will commence for these urea products. Exporters must use these new 
codes when exporting goods previously classified to the AHECC 31021000.    

New AHECC and import statistical codes for toxins 

From 1 April 2022, new import statistical codes will commence for the toxins, saxitoxin and ricin under tariff 
subheading 3002.49.00. The tariff classification for these goods changed from tariff subheading 3002.90.00 
on 1 January 2022 due to the commencement of the 2022 Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding 
System. The new statistical codes ensure that statistics on these toxins can be correctly captured. 

New AHECC codes for saxitoxin, ricin and other goods previously classified to AHECC 30024900 will commence 
from 1 May 2022. Exporters will be required to classify their goods to the new AHECC codes from this date.   

New unit quantities for certain engineered structural timber products 

The units for imported glue-laminated timber, cross-laminated timber, I beams and other engineered 
structural timber products will no longer be ‘sm’ (square metres). From 1 April 2022 the units for these goods 
will not be specified to enable alternative measurements to be used for the import of these goods. The units 
used for the export of these goods will change from square metres on 1 May 2022.    

Revised Tariff Working pages reflecting these changes are available at Attachment A.

No. 2022/17 
Customs Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) 
Bill 2022 

On 30 March 2022, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022 (the Bill) was 
introduced into the House of Representatives. The Bill would amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the 
Customs Tariff Act) to provide for a temporary 50 per cent reduction in the non-ad valorem component of 
specified fuel duty rates. The temporary reduction period would apply from 30 March 2022 to 
29 September 2022. 

The temporary reduction will only be applied after the Bill is passed by the Parliament and receives the Royal 
Assent. Should this not occur, a further Australian Customs Notice will be issued. 

Equivalent changes are proposed to be made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. 

Integrated Cargo System 

The temporary rates will not be entered into the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) until after the Bill receives 
the Royal Assent. If this occurs after 30 March 2022, the rates will retrospectively commence on 
30 March 2022. Any goods entered for home consumption on or after 30 March 2022 until the time the 
reduced rates have been entered into the ICS will need to apply for a refund. Refund circumstance ‘EB’ 
should be quoted. 

Provisions for subheadings listed in section 19AAC of the Customs Tariff Act  
(rows 1 to 4 of the table) 

The Bill provides for a temporary 50 per cent reduction to be applied to the non-ad valorem rate of customs 
duty applied to the tariff subheadings listed in section 19AAC of the Customs Tariff Act. These subheadings 
are subject to bi-annual indexation in accordance with the indexation factor calculated under section 19 of 
the Customs Tariff Act. These classifications are listed in the table below. 

From 30 March 2022 to the August 2022 replacement date, the rates specified in the top four rows of the 
table below will apply. An Australian Customs Notice providing the rate that will apply from the August 2022 
replacement date to 29 September 2022 will be published after the June Consumer Price Index is published 
by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. 

Provisions for subheadings listed in section 19AABB of the Bill  
(rows 5 and 6 of the table) 

The Bill also lists additional subheadings which will also have a temporary 50 per cent reduction applied to 
the non-ad valorem rate of customs duty applied to the tariff subheadings. These subheadings are not 
subject to indexation. As such, the temporary rates of $0.043 per litre or $0.043 per kilogram will apply from 
30 March 2022 to 29 September 2022. These classifications are listed in the table below.

No. 2022/18 

Arms, flags and seals amendments to the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and the Customs 
Regulation 2015. 

On 5 April 2022 the Customs Legislation Amendment (Flags) Regulations 2022 amended the Customs 
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the Regulations) and the Customs Regulation 2015 for the 
importation of goods bearing the Arms, a flag or a seal of a State or Territory (or a representation likely to 
deceive). The amendments streamline the importation process for goods bearing the Arms, a flag or a seal 
of a State or Territory and reduce regulatory burden for importers.  

Changes to import requirements are: 

The importation process for goods bearing the Arms, a flag or a seal of a State or Territory (or a 
representation likely to deceive) is being aligned to the importation process for goods that bear the Arms, 
flag or seal of the Commonwealth. This means importers only need to present the Australian Border Force 
(ABF) with design approval from the Department of Premier and Cabinet or the Chief Ministers Department 
of the relevant state or territory. This design approval serves as import permission under the Regulations, 
replacing the former requirement for an additional import permit from the ABF. 

Goods bearing the Arms, a flag or a seal of a State or Territory will remain subject to the post importation 
permission scheme through an amendment to the Customs Regulation 2015. 

Strict procedures remain in place to ensure that only those with a lawful need to import of goods bearing the 
Arms, a flag or a seal of a State or Territory (or a representation likely to deceive) are able to do so provided 
they meet certain conditions and requirements. The penalties for importing these prohibited goods without a 
permit can include a fine of up to 1,000 penalty units (currently $222,000), or up to three times the value of 
the goods, whichever is greater. 

For further information regarding these changes, please consult the legislation directly, including the 
explanatory statement (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2022L00512).

No. 2022/20 
Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme – Allocations for 
2022-2023 

The Australian Border Force will shortly contact Cheese and Curd Quota Scheme holders to discuss quota 
allocations for 2022-2023. 

The calculation of an importer’s forthcoming allocation is based on the importer’s usage of quota, as shown 
in the Department’s records of Import Declarations, which were entered for home consumption between 
01 July 2020 and 31 May 2022. 

We remind importers that quotas are allocated for a particular financial year.  To use the quota allocated, 
importers are required to ‘enter for home consumption’ their imported cheese or curd by the end of the 
financial year to which the allocation relates, that is, by 30 June of that year.  Where cheese or curd 
importations are of Australian origin (returned Australian goods), or a free rate of duty is provided under 
Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, then the quota cannot be used.  Similarly, if preference 
circumstances or Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), as listed in the various schedules of the Customs Tariff 
Act 95 apply, then the quota is not available.  

Pursuant to subsections 71A(7) and (8) of the Customs Act 1901, the cheese or curd is ‘entered for home 
consumption’ on the latter of the following two dates: 

(a) 
(b) 

the date of original lodgment; Or 
the date of the arrival of the vessel or aircraft at the first Australian port or airport at which any cargo 
is intended to be discharged. 

Please note that: 
• 

The quota calculation excludes any part of the quota transferred to another importer during the 23-
month period or that remains unused at 31 May 2022 
For the 2023-24 allocation period, the allocation will be calculated by the sum of:

and consequently maximising their next allocation.

2022-04-13,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2022-21.pdf,New rates of customs duty for Russian and Belarusian goods,"Australian Customs Notice  
No. 2022/21 
New rates of customs duty for Russian and Belarusian 
goods 

From 25 April 2022, Australia will join like-minded countries in removing the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) 
treatment previously accorded to goods imported from the Russian Federation (Russia), by imposing an 
additional customs duty of 35% on goods that are the produce or manufacture of Russia and Belarus. This 
increase in duty is in line with the increases imposed by the United Kingdom and Canada.   

This temporary measure is a response to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, supported by Belarus, and is 
necessary for the protection of Australia’s essential security interests. Russia’s actions, supported by 
Belarus, are a gross violation of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations. They violate 
Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and undermine the rules-based international order. Australia is 
committed to upholding these principles, which are essential to international, regional and domestic stability 
and security. 

Goods to which new rates of customs duty apply  

Goods that are the produce or manufacture of Russia or Belarus and left for direct shipment to Australia from 
a place of manufacture or warehouse in a country from which the goods were exported between 
25 April 2022 and 24 October 2022 and are entered for home consumption in Australia within this period are 
no longer eligible for the general rate of customs duty in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 
(Customs Tariff Act).  

This measure will commence through Notice of Intention to Propose Customs Tariff Alterations (No. 4) 2022. 
In accordance with proposed section 18A, goods are the produce or manufacture of Russia or Belarus if: 

 

 

the goods are unmanufactured raw products of Russia or Belarus within the meaning of the 
Customs Act 1901; or 
the last process in the manufacture of the goods was performed in Russia or Belarus. 

Goods will continue to be the produce or manufacture of Russia or Belarus if the goods are exported to 
another country and undergo the following, or similar, processes:  

changing of packaging or the breaking up or assembly of packages 

  operations to preserve goods in good condition for the purposes of transport or storage 
 
  disassembly of goods 
  placing goods in bottles, cases or boxes, fixing on cars or other simple packaging operations 
  affixing of marks, labels or other similar distinguishing signs on goods or their packaging 
 

simple processes of sifting, screening, sorting or classifying or other similar simple processes 

Please note, the above list is not an exhaustive list of the processes that will be disregarded for the purposes 
of determining if goods are the produce or manufacture of Russia or Belarus.

No. 2022/27 
Commencement of phase 2 of the Recycling and 
Waste Reduction (Export–Waste Plastics) Rules 2021

With effect from 1 July 2022, Australia will further restrict exports of waste plastic under the Recycling and 
Waste Reduction Act 2020 (the Act) and the Recycling and Waste Reduction (Export-Waste Plastics) Rules 
2021 (the Plastic Rules).

Phase two of the Plastic Rules will only allow the export of waste plastics that have been sorted into a single 
resin or polymer type and capable of re-manufacture without further processing; or is processed with other 
materials into processed engineered fuel. Exporters will not be issued a waste export licence to export 
unprocessed, baled waste plastic as they will not meet the requirements of the Plastics Rules from 
1 July 2022. 

Exporters will be required to hold a waste export licence for plastic and declare each export consignment of 
waste plastic to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. 

The intent of the measure is to prevent the export of unprocessed waste plastic, which is likely to have a 
negative impact on human health and the environment in the receiving country. It will also maximise the 
ability of the Australian waste and recycling sector to collect, recover, recycle, reuse and convert waste 
plastic into new products. 

The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water administers licences to export 
waste plastic, which can be valid for up to three years. Waste export licences are subject to conditions. 
Exporters need to meet the requirements of the Act and the Plastic Rules in order for the Minister for the 
Environment and Water to consider granting a waste export licence. 

For further information on the new export regulation of waste products, please visit the Department of 
Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water website or send your queries to 
exportwaste@environment.gov.au.

abandoned goods","Australian Customs Notice (ACN) 
2022/29 

New timeframes for the disposal of unentered and 
abandoned goods 

From 1 July 2022, a shorter holding period will apply to the disposal of imported goods that have not been 
claimed by the importer.  

From this date, operators holding unentered or abandoned goods may dispose of the goods, subject to 
permission from the Australian Border Force (ABF), after the following time periods have passed: 

  unentered goods (i.e. goods that have not been entered for home consumption or warehousing) – 

two calendar months from the second working day after importation,  

  abandoned goods (i.e. goods that may have been abandoned by their owner and are not required, or 
unable to be, entered for home consumption) – two calendar months from when the goods are found 
at a customs place.  

o 

If it is clear that the goods have been abandoned, the ABF may approve the disposal of 
abandoned goods within the two calendar month period.   

o  Evidence may be required to confirm when the goods became abandoned.   

The ABF has introduced the new two-month timeframe in response to industry feedback, in consultation with 
the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The reform provides a simpler and streamlined 
timeframe for unentered and abandoned goods, and reduces the period that these goods must be held from 
the previous 90-days (abandoned goods) and six-month (unentered goods) periods. 

For depot operators, the reduction in the timeframe will mean that almost all unclaimed imported goods can 
be disposed of without first having to remove the goods to a warehouse under section 77P of the  
Customs Act 1901.  

Consistent with existing arrangements, once the two-month period has passed, industry operators may be 
able to donate suitable goods to charity, sell the goods to recover their costs, or destroy, recycle or re-export 
the goods. 

Further information on unentered and abandoned goods can be found at abf.gov.au/importing-exporting-and-

Temporary duty reduction for goods from Ukraine 

Commencing on 4 July 2022 and for a 12 month period, goods that are the produce or manufacture of 
Ukraine, will have a ‘Free’ rate of duty. This arrangement is established by Notice of Intention to Propose 
Customs Tariff Alterations (No. 5) 2022 (the Notice) (Attachment A), signed on 11 July 2022. 

Rules of Origin 

Goods are determined to be the produce or manufacture of Ukraine, if they meet the requirements under 
Division 1A of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901 as it applies to Developing Countries. For the purposes of 
determining originating status for goods from Ukraine, inputs from other Developing Countries can be 
included as originating in the qualifying region.  

For the purposes of determining originating status for goods from other Developing Countries, inputs from 
Ukraine cannot be included as originating in the qualifying region. 

To ensure that a ‘Free’ rate of customs duty is accessible to goods that may be the produce or manufacture 
of Ukraine, goods containing inputs from Russia and Belarus, can still be considered originating provided 
they meet the rules of origin requirements. 

Integrated Cargo System 

The temporary rates for Ukraine will be entered into the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) as soon as practical 
following the registration of the Notice. The rates will retrospectively commence on 4 July 2022. Any goods 
entered for home consumption on or after 4 July 2022 until the time the temporary rates have been entered 
into the ICS will need to apply for a refund. Refund circumstance ‘EB’ should be quoted. 

To declare these goods, the following details must be recorded on the import declaration (Nature 10, 
Nature 30 or Nature 10/20): 

1. 

In the Origin Country Code field enter the two-digit United Nations country code UA. 

2. 

In the Preference Origin Country Code field enter the country code UA. 

3. 

4. 

In the Preference Scheme Type field, click on the drop down button and select DCU (Developing 
Country – Ukraine). 

In the Preference Rule Type field click on the drop down button and select one of the following

2022-07-28,https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/CustomsNotices/2022-35.pdf,Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods on 1 August 2022,"Australian Customs Notice  
No. 2022/35 
Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent 
goods on 1 August 2022 

This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, beers 
and fuel products, operative from 1 August 2022.   

Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides for customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  

The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is calculated 
by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June or 
December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. The December 2021 Quarter CPI 
figure (121.3) will be used to determine the indexation factor for the duty rate increase applied on 
1 August 2022, as it is higher than the previously used June 2021 Quarter CPI figure (refer to ACN 2022/05).  

On 27 July 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June 2022 Quarter CPI  
figure (126.1). 

The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for August 2022 are set out in the table below: 

Most recent CPI number 

Highest previous June or 
December Quarter 

June Quarter 2022 

December Quarter 2021 

Indexation Factor 

126.1 

121.3 

1.040 

As the indexation factor for August 2022 (1.040) is greater than one, customs duty rates for certain 
excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff, will increase by the application of this factor.   

The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 1 August 2022, are set out in Table 1 
below and supersede the rates outlined in Australian Customs Notice 2022/05. 

The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:  

  Schedule 4A (Singaporean originating goods)  
  Schedule 5 (US originating goods)  
  Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods) 
  Schedule 6A (Peruvian originating goods)  
  Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods)
